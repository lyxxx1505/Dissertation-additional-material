2025-07-30T15:00:31Z,Adani claims its export program helps contribute to sustainable energy – but experts say that’s ‘wilful disinformation’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/31/adani-claims-its-export-program-helps-contribute-to-sustainable-energy-but-experts-say-thats-wilful-disinformation-ntwnfb,"An Adani claim that its Australian export program, whereby coal is sent through the Great Barrier Reef’s shipping channels, is advancing the United Nations’ sustainable development goals, has been denounced by leading scientists. Adani’s Queensland export site claims its operations “ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”, which is one of the UN’s 17 sustainable development goals. Australia, along with other UN members, adopted the goals in 2015, designed to address global challenges including poverty, justice, environmental degradation and climate change. The relevant UN goal is chiefly concerned with providing affordable and clean energy, which it says requires a substantial increase in renewable energy. Adani’s North Queensland Export Terminal (NQXT) near Bowen has the capacity to export 50m tonnes of coal a year. In its latest sustainability report, NQXT says it supports the UN goal by “enabling the export of high-quality Australian coal to the world”. One of Australia’s leading experts on the development goals, Prof John Thwaites, said the word “sustainable” in the UN goal was key. “I would argue that to ‘support the advancement of the sustainable development goals’, energy and port operations need to support sustainable energy,” said Thwaites, the chair of the Monash Sustainable Development Institute. “Simply exporting coal is not achieving or supporting the sustainability objective of the goals.” Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletter He said there were also numerous references in the UN goals for the need to take action on climate change, and that “simply exporting coal which will be burned and produce greenhouse gas emissions overseas” is not supportive of this. Another leading expert on the UN agenda, Dr Cameron Allen, said the intention of the energy development goal was to “focus on sustainable energy and clean energy and I don’t think fossil fuels or coal falls into that”. “I don’t think anyone would agree that it’s in line with the aims of that goal,” said Allen, from Monash University. “Exporting coal isn’t in line with the sentiment … or the language of the goal, which includes the word sustainable. The international climate change agreements also make it clear that burning fossil fuels is not sustainable.” Guardian Australia has been scrutinising various claims made by Adani after finding that its Carmichael coal operation has paid zero corporate tax in more than three years of operation, and may never do so. The Indian conglomerate had pledged to plough billions of dollars into the Australian economy through taxes and royalties when it was going through the contested approvals process to establish an open-cut coalmine in the Galilee Basin. In response to questions about how its operations advance the UN sustainability goals, a spokesperson for Adani’s Australian mining business, which is branded Bravus Mining and Resources, said coal exports helped combat poverty. “Developing nations in the Asia Pacific region use coal from the Carmichael mine alongside renewables to provide reliable and affordable energy solutions that help reduce poverty and power growth,” the Bravus spokesperson said. Adani’s port facility website also says its operations align with a UN goal to protect terrestrial ecosystems by managing its water on-site next to neighbouring wetlands. Traditional owners have raised concerns over the threat posed by the coal operations to the nearby Caley Valley, in claims rejected by Adani. In 2017 and 2019, flood waters were released from the port into the wetland. In the 2017 incident, the Queensland government later found the water that turned areas of the wetlands black from coal dust had not caused a widespread impact. Adani’s Carmichael mine, rail and port operation is among the most politically divisive projects in Australia, given it has opened up new fossil fuel reserves in a sensitive location at a time the country has pledged to transition to renewables. Claire Snyder, director of watchdog group Climate Integrity, said the NQXT claim amounted to aggressive greenwashing. “Framing coal exports as a contribution to sustainable development undermines global climate goals, misleads the public, and uses the authority of the UN to legitimise ongoing harm,” Snyder said. “Given what we know about coal’s role in driving climate breakdown, this is wilful disinformation and meaningless sustainability waffle to protect the social licence of coal.”",Adani Group; Australia news; Environment; Coal; Energy; Fossil fuels; Energy; United Nations; Queensland; Carmichael coalmine,Business
2025-07-03T17:04:48Z,How the global trade in donkey skins threatens the lives of women and girls | Letter,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jul/03/how-the-global-trade-in-donkey-skins-threatens-the-lives-of-women-and-girls,"Re your editorial (The Guardian view on China, Africa and disappearing donkeys: an unexpected crisis offers a clue to perils ahead, 25 June), last year, The Donkey Sanctuary revealed at least 5.9 million donkeys are slaughtered for their skins every year to produce ejiao, a traditional Chinese medicine. Donkeys suffer at every stage – from capture and transport to brutal slaughter. With China’s donkey population depleted, the industry has turned to other countries in the global south. Despite its scale, this cruel trade remains largely unregulated and invisible, and it is women and girls who suffer most. For many, donkeys are much more than animals – they are co-workers and companions. When a donkey is stolen, household income can fall by 73%. In one Kenyan region, over 90% of women have experienced donkey theft. Children – especially girls – are taken out of school to do the “donkey work”. Every shocking statistic and voice of anguish in our report Stolen Donkeys, Stolen Futures is evidence that the donkey skin trade is undermining progress towards UN sustainable development goals of gender equality and poverty reduction. It is not only African donkeys that face an existential threat from the skin trade. In Brazil, the donkey population has dropped by 94% in the past 30 years, from 1.37 million in 1996 to around 78,000 in 2025. But there is hope. Legislators in Brazil have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to protect their donkeys when a bill banning their slaughter goes to its national congress. At the Pan-African Donkey Conference in Côte d’Ivoire last month, leaders across the continent called for coordinated action to protect donkeys and the communities they support. We must remember that this isn’t just about banning the skin trade for the sake of livelihoods – it’s about creating a better world for donkeys. These intelligent, sentient beings deserve respect, compassion and protection.

The draft legislation, which is intended to help Spain meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals and comply with EU legislation on reducing single-use plastic products, will also ban people from disposing of wet wipes down the toilet, as well as prohibiting the deliberate release of disposable party balloons containing plastic into the environment because of the marine pollution they cause. According to the law’s outline, wet wipes and balloons are among the 10 single-use plastic items most commonly found on beaches in the EU. “Wet wipes – even those made with natural polymers that haven’t been chemically modified – have a negative environmental impact and significantly affect the functioning of the sewer and purification networks,” the legislation says. “Because they do not disintegrate completely, they cause obstructions in the sewer system that reduce its water retention capacity and increase the risk of overflows – especially during spells of heavy rain.” The draft notes that microfibres from wet wipes also end up in rivers and other bodies of water, leaving local authorities with hefty cleanup bills and environmental fines. Figures from the Spanish Association of Water Supply and Sanitation put the annual cost of clearing wet wipes from sewer and purification systems at €230m (£190m). Given the environmental damage that wet wipes and balloons cause, the new law will oblige their manufacturers to cover the costs of cleaning up their products, “including cleaning of sanitation and treatment infrastructure, as well as its subsequent transport and treatment”. In addition to being responsible for regular collections of litter involving their products and sporadic spills, they will be obliged to cover the costs of “awareness-raising measures”. The draft also says that although genuinely biodegradable wipes will be exempt from the ban on “the disposal of wet wipes down the toilet”, the environment ministry recommends people do not throw any kinds of wet wipes down the loo “so as to minimise the impact on sewer infrastructure and the environment”. Asked how the proposed bans would work in practice, sources at the ministry stressed that the law was still a work in progress, adding: “Educating people and raising awareness are always important elements.”",Environment; Spain; Water; Europe; World news; Coastlines,Environment

The fund would help provide models, computing power and AI-related training programmes, according to recommendations from the UN secretary general’s high-level AI advisory body. Dame Wendy Hall, professor of computer science at the University of Southampton and a member of the UN’s advisory body on AI, said the western world must not make the same mistakes with the technology that it made with the climate crisis. Referring to developing countries outside the northern hemisphere, Hall said states unable to invest in AI should be given help. “If we don’t address an issue like a global AI fund now, we risk going down the same route as we did with climate change where developed countries are able to address the problem and race ahead while the global south is left behind and doesn’t have the capacity to address it,” she said. The report recommends the creation of an accessible store of AI models and datasets (required to build models) that can help achieve the UN’s sustainable development goals, which include eliminating poverty and providing quality education. The report also recommends the creation of an international scientific panel on AI which would issue an annual report on AI-related “capabilities, opportunities, risks and uncertainties”. It warns that no global framework exists to govern AI and that the technology could be imposed on people without them having any say in the process. Last year, AI companies and several states committed to a voluntary agreement to test the most powerful AI models, while this month the UK signed an international treaty that aims to prevent misuses of AI. “To place its governance in the hands of a few developers, or countries that host them, will create a deeply unfair situation,” the report says, adding that the UN can host regular intergovernmental dialogue to foster common ground on managing the technology’s impact.",Technology sector; Artificial intelligence (AI); United Nations; Computing; Business; World news; Inequality; Global development; Sustainable development goals; Sustainable development; Environmental sustainability,Business
2025-07-22T13:27:46Z,Trump pulls US out of Unesco in blow for UN culture and education agency,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/22/us-unesco-withdrawal-trump-united-nations,"The US will quit the United Nations’ culture and education agency Unesco, the US state department has said, as Donald Trump continues to pull out of international institutions. “Unesco works to advance divisive social and cultural causes and maintains an outsized focus on the UN’s sustainable development goals, a globalist, ideological agenda for international development at odds with our America First foreign policy,” a state department spokesperson, Tammy Bruce, said. The move is a blow to the Paris-based global organisation, founded after the second world war to promote peace through international cooperation in education, science and culture. The decision is part of the president’s second-term drive to pull the US out of a series of global bodies, including leaving the World Health Organization (WHO), halting funding to the Palestinian relief agency Unrwa and withdrawing from the UN human rights council, as part of a review of US participation in UN agencies. A US withdrawal, to take effect in December 2026, will be a blow to Unesco’s work on education, culture and combating hate speech. But officials at the Unesco headquarters in Paris had been braced for a potential US departure during Trump’s second term. The US provides about 8% of the body’s total budget, making the financial impact of Washington’s departure less severe than for other organisations, such as the WHO, for which the US is by far the biggest financial backer. The White House deputy spokesperson Anna Kelly told the New York Post: “President Trump has decided to withdraw the United States from Unesco – which supports woke, divisive cultural and social causes that are totally out of step with the commonsense policies that Americans voted for in November.” In February, the White House had announced a 90-day review of the US membership of Unesco, saying in a statement that the global body had “demonstrated failure to reform itself, has continually demonstrated anti-Israel sentiment over the past decade, and has failed to address concerns over mounting arrears”. Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, is best known for designating world heritage sites including the Grand Canyon in the US and the ancient city of Palmyra in Syria. It also has a large cultural and education programme to promote intercultural dialogue. The US was a founding member of Unesco in 1945, but this latest departure will be the third time it has quit. Washington first withdrew in 1983 under Ronald Reagan, whose administration said the global organisation had anti-western bias and “has extraneously politicised virtually every subject it deals with”. It rejoined under George W Bush in 2003, with the White House saying it was happy with Unesco reforms. Trump pulled the US out of Unesco in 2017, during his first term as president. His administration cited what it called “mounting arrears, the need for fundamental reform in the organisation, and continuing anti-Israel bias”. The US returned to Unesco in 2023 under Joe Biden. The Biden administration said it was crucial to rejoin in order to counter “Chinese influence”. Beijing had become the organisation’s biggest financial backer in Washington’s absence. As a condition of readmission, the US agreed to pay about $619m in unpaid dues and make contributions to programmes supporting education access initiatives in Africa, Holocaust remembrance and journalists’ safety. In 2011, Unesco voted to admit Palestine, which is not formally recognised by the US or Israel as a UN member state. The Barack Obama White House had cut Unesco contributions, resulting in the US owing millions in arrears to the organisation. Audrey Azoulay, the director general of Unesco, said: “However regrettable, this announcement was anticipated and Unesco has prepared for it.” Azoulay said she “deeply” regretted Trump’s decision to leave, saying the move “contradicts the fundamental principles of multilateralism”. She said the reasons given by the US for leaving were the same as during Trump’s first term, and she disputed them. “These claims contradict the reality of Unesco’s efforts, particularly in the field of Holocaust education and the fight against antisemitism.” Azoulay said Unesco had undertaken structural reforms and diversified its funding sources, so “the decreasing trend in the financial contribution of the US has been offset”. Unesco was not considering cutting jobs due to the US departure, she added.",Unesco; Donald Trump; United Nations; US news; Trump administration; Paris; US politics; World news,World news
2025-07-17T11:00:36Z,Will Mike Waltz lead a ‘full-frontal assault’ on the UN?,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jul/17/mike-waltz-un-nominee-ambassador-global-development-signal-group-chat-scandal,"When and if Donald Trump’s nominee for ambassador to the UN, Mike Waltz, takes up the post, many are concerned that in his pursuit of the rehabilitation of his image, global development will not be a priority. Diplomats work for decades to be considered for the coveted position of ambassador, but in this case the role is a consolation prize for the 51-year-old former army colonel from Florida, says Richard Gowan, UN director of International Crisis Group. Gowan believes Waltz will be “very performative” as he attempts to rebuild his political brand after the scandal of reportedly adding a journalist to a Signal chat that contained sensitive information on planned military strikes in Yemen. He will have to follow the line coming from Washington, says Gowan. “There is a history of American politicians using the UN as a way to burnish their domestic credentials.” Global development professionals are concerned about what a hawkish Republican wanting to regain favour post-scandal could mean for the UN at a time when Trump is already causing significant damage to aid and development work. In a Senate confirmation hearing this week, Waltz said he would push for transparency and reforms within the UN while pursuing an “America first” agenda that would see the US ensuring “that every foreign aid dollar and every contribution to an international organisation, particularly the UN, draws a straight and direct line to a compelling US national interest”. Since January, the US has withdrawn its funding from several UN agencies, called for reviews of its involvement in all UN treaties and stopped engaging with the UN human rights council. Simultaneously, it has dismantled much of its own USAID agency. The US has historically been the largest donor to the UN. “This has put the UN in a huge financial crisis,” says Louis Charbonneau, UN director at Human Rights Watch, adding that it compromises humanitarian and human rights work globally. The appointment could also jeopardise global targets such as the sustainable development goals, says Beth Schlachter, senior director of US external relations at the family planning non-profit MSI Reproductive Choices. The Trump administration has denounced the goals as “adverse to the rights and interests of Americans”, and Schlachter believes its anti-rights stance influenced the omission of sexual and reproductive health rights from a UN political declaration on the human rights of women and girls this year. “How is there an agreement on women’s issues if you don’t agree to include that?” she asks. There was once consensus among member states on foundational UN agreements, and disagreements were about new additions, but now, led by the US, the basics can’t even be agreed upon, says Schlachter. With that in mind, the US is “staffing themselves to be able to pull things down”, she says. Waltz, who was vocal in his support for the 2022 Dobbs decision which upended Roe v Wade, limiting a woman’s right to an abortion in the US, and questioned the UN’s work on climate change at this week’s hearing, is of particular concern. Many UN projects focus on providing access to sexual health and reproductive rights and combatting the impact of global warming. He has, however, also shown support for human rights. In 2021, he was among the first members of Congress to call for the US to boycott the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics in protest at China’s treatment of the Uyghur ethnic minority group. He told the Senate that the US needs a strong voice to counter China and if he is able to take a strong stance on China’s abuse of human rights and push these issues at the UN, that would be great, says Charbonneau. In New York, UN officials and diplomats are simply happy at the prospect of the role being filled, says Gowan. It has been vacant since Trump took office in January. “And there’s been no real political representative of the White House here that other countries can bargain with … [or] who represents Trump that [António] Guterres can talk to,” he says. But that doesn’t stop experts fearing that at the annual UN general assembly in September, Waltz will lead “an incredibly damaging full-frontal assault on the UN, its legitimacy as an organisation and the specific things that they don’t like – clearly everything related to women”, says Schlachter.",Global development; US politics; United Nations; Donald Trump; US news; World news; Trump administration,Global development
2025-07-01T17:53:32Z,"The Guardian view on Trump’s aid cuts and development: the global majority deserve justice, not charity | Editorial",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/01/the-guardian-view-on-trumps-aid-cuts-and-development-the-global-majority-deserve-justice-not-charity,"When one door closes, you would hope that another opens. As USAID was formally shut down on Monday, a once-in-a-decade development financing conference was kicking off in Seville. But while initially intended to move the world closer to its ambitious 2030 sustainable development goals, it now looks more like an attempt to prevent a reversal of the progress already made. A study published in the Lancet predicted that Donald Trump’s aid cuts could claim more than 14 million lives by 2030, a third of them among children. For many poor countries, the scale of the shock would be similar to that of a major war, the authors found. More than four-fifths of the US agency’s programmes have been cut, with surviving projects folded into the state department. The US was by far the world’s largest donor to global development – though its contributions were a fraction of the G7 target of 0.7% of GDP. Yet the damage does not end there. Its move encouraged others to follow suit. The UK, Germany and France are slashing their aid budgets to spend more on defence. Oxfam says that the collective retrenchment by G7 nations is the biggest aid cut since 1960, with spending 26% lower in 2026 than it was last year. Don’t expect China or the Gulf states to fill this gaping hole. It is not just grim news for aid recipients. It bodes ill for all. It would be naive to imagine that aid is a high‑mindedly altruistic endeavour. Just as conflict breeds hunger and poverty, so injustice and deprivation breed instability and a more dangerous world. Slashing health budgets also increases the risks of another global pandemic. Developing countries hoped that the UN- and Spanish-hosted International Conference on Financing for Development would at least see a willingness to tackle an international financial system stacked against the global majority. Instead, the US, UK, EU and others shamefully acted as blockers, watering down the language on a UN intergovernmental process to tackle the debt crisis. The US reportedly proposed 400 amendments across a multitude of issues to the conference’s outcome document before pulling out entirely. Others will need to be held to their too-limited commitments. More than two-fifths of the global population live in low income countries which are in debt distress or close to it. Many poor African nations are spending more on debt financing than they do on health or education. Contrary to popular perception – and any sense of justice and decency – wealth is flowing from them to developed nations. The UN says that servicing debt cost developing countries $847bn last year, rising to $947bn this year. Yet developed countries are choosing to shore up an unfair global financial system. The keenness of the UK and others to focus on private sector‑oriented solutions looks like better news for the City than developing nations. The promise that private finance would turn “billions to trillions” was enthusiastically promoted a decade ago, yet largely failed to materialise. Despite the enduring inequality, the last few decades saw extraordinary progress in areas such as cutting child mortality. For all their flaws, USAID-funded programmes alone saved almost 92 million lives over 20 years. We know that remarkable leaps in human wellbeing are possible. We will all regret it if, in this time of conflict and crisis, we slam the door shut on such advances and block out the call of justice. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

2025-07-10T12:47:24Z,"With the world in crisis, many say end globalisation. I say that would be a mistake | Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/10/world-crisis-end-globalisation-mistake-lula-da-silva,"The year 2025 should be a time of celebration, marking eight decades of the United Nations’ existence. But it risks going down in history as the year when the international order built since 1945 collapsed. The cracks had long been visible. Since the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, the intervention in Libya and the war in Ukraine, some permanent members of the security council have trivialised the illegal use of force. The failure to act vis-a-vis the genocide in Gaza represents a denial of the most basic values of humanity. The inability to overcome differences is fuelling a new escalation of violence in the Middle East, the latest chapter of which includes the attack on Iran. The law of the strongest also threatens the multilateral trading system. Sweeping tariffs disrupt value chains and push the global economy into a spiral of high prices and stagnation. The World Trade Organization has been hollowed out, and no one remembers the Doha development round. The 2008 financial collapse exposed the failure of neoliberal globalisation, but the world remained locked into the austerity playbook. The choice to bail out the ultra-wealthy and major corporations at the expense of ordinary citizens and small businesses has deepened inequality. In the past 10 years, the $33.9tn (£25tn) accumulated by the world’s richest 1% is equivalent to 22 times the resources needed to eradicate global poverty, according to a report by Oxfam. The stranglehold on the state’s capacity for action has led to public distrust in institutions. Discontent has become fertile ground for extremist narratives that threaten democracy and promote hate as a political project. Many countries have cut cooperation programmes instead of redoubling efforts to implement the sustainable development goals by 2030. The available resources are insufficient, the costs are high, access is bureaucratic, and the conditions imposed often fail to respect local realities. This is not about charity, but about addressing disparities rooted in centuries of exploitation, interference and violence against the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa and Asia. In a world with a combined GDP of over $100tn, it is unacceptable that more than 700 million people still suffer from hunger and live without electricity or water. The richest countries bear the greatest historical responsibility for carbon emissions, yet it is the poorest who will suffer the most from the climate crisis. The year 2024 was the hottest in history, showing that reality is moving faster than the Paris agreement. The binding obligations of the Kyoto protocol were replaced by voluntary commitments, and the financing pledges made at COP 15 in Copenhagen in 2009 – promising $100bn annually – never materialised. The recent increase in Nato’s military spending makes that possibility even more remote. Attacks on international institutions ignore the concrete benefits the multilateral system has brought to people’s lives. If smallpox has been eradicated, the ozone layer preserved and labour rights still protected in much of the world, it is thanks to the efforts of these institutions. In times of growing polarisation, terms such as “deglobalisation” have become commonplace. But it is impossible to “deplanetise” our shared existence. No wall is high enough to preserve islands of peace and prosperity surrounded by violence and misery. Today’s world is vastly different from that of 1945. New forces have emerged, and new challenges have arisen. If international organisations seem ineffective, it is because their structure no longer reflects the current reality. Unilateral and exclusionary actions are worsened by the absence of collective leadership. The solution to the multilateralism crisis is not to abandon it, but to rebuild it on fairer and more inclusive foundations. This is the understanding that Brazil – whose vocation has always been to foster collaboration among nations – demonstrated during its G20 presidency last year and continues to demonstrate through its presidencies of the Brics and Cop 30 this year: that it is possible to find common ground even in adverse scenarios. There is an urgent need to recommit to diplomacy and rebuild the foundations of true multilateralism – one capable of answering the outcry of a humanity fearful for its future. Only then can we stop passively watching the rise of inequality, the senselessness of war and the destruction of our own planet.

The former US presidents made rare public criticisms of the Trump administration as they took part in a video farewell for USAID staffers on Monday on its last day as an independent organisation. In March, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, announced that 83% of USAID’s programmes had been cancelled. The agency is being folded into the state department, where it is to be replaced by a successor organisation called America First. A study published in the Lancet found the cuts could cause more than 14 million additional deaths by 2030, with a third of those among children. USAID funding for health care, nutrition, humanitarian aid, development, education and related sectors have helped prevent more than 91 million deaths in low- and middle-income countries over the past two decades, the multinational group of researchers calculated. They concluded: “Unless the abrupt funding cuts announced and implemented in the first half of 2025 are reversed, a staggering number of avoidable deaths could occur by 2030.” For many of the world’s poorer countries “the resulting shock would be similar in scale to a global pandemic or a major armed conflict”, they said, but “would stem from a conscious and avoidable policy choice”. “From our experience on the ground, we have witnessed how USAID support has strengthened local health systems’ ability to respond to diseases like HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis,” said Francisco Saúte, general director at the Manhiça Health Research Centre and co-author of the study. “Cutting this funding now not only puts lives at risk –it also undermines critical infrastructure that has taken decades to build.” The researchers said reductions in spending by other international donors would potentially lead to even more additional deaths. USAID was founded six decades ago by president John F Kennedy and had, until recently, enjoyed broad bipartisan support. However, it was aggressively targeted by the current administration. Donald Trump claimed the agency was run by “radical left lunatics” and rife with “tremendous fraud”. Elon Musk called it “a criminal organisation”. In a recorded message played in a video conference for USAID staffers on Monday, Obama said that dismantling the agency was “a colossal mistake”. The call was closed to the media, but parts of the video were shared with the Associated Press. “Gutting USAID is a travesty, and it’s a tragedy. Because it’s some of the most important work happening anywhere in the world,” said Obama, crediting the organisation with saving lives and playing a role in economic growth that turned recipients into US trade partners. He predicted that “sooner or later, leaders on both sides of the aisle will realise how much you are needed”, adding: “your work has mattered and will matter for generations to come.” In his message, Bush spoke about cuts to the President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar), which is credited with saving more than 25 million lives. He said: “Is it in our national interests that 25 million people who would have died now live? I think it is, and so do you.” He told attendees: “You’ve showed the great strength of America through your work – and that is your good heart.” Pepfar was due to play a big role in the rollout of new, long-acting drugs to prevent HIV in poorer countries later this year; the cuts have left global health advocates unsure whether the plans will go ahead as hoped. The video conference was reportedly attended by thousands, including many joining from overseas. Singer Bono recited a poem he had written for the occasion, telling staffers: “They called you crooks/When you were the best of us.” The Trump administration’s closure of USAID has faced legal challenges and been criticised for its abrupt nature, with organisations that had received grants ordered to stop work with immediate effect in February, and staff terminated via mass emails. Monday’s call also featured former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos and former US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield. Humanitarian workers also participated, including one who told the story of the welcome appearance of USAID workers with food when she was a frightened 8-year-old child in a camp for Liberian refugees. USAID was the world’s leading donor for humanitarian and development aid. In 2023, funding from the US accounted for 43% of government donations to the humanitarian system, the Lancet authors said. “These findings come at a critical moment,” said Davide Rasella, ICREA research professor at ISGlobal and coordinator of the study, pointing to a UN summit in Seville this week discussing financing for development. “If we want to achieve the SDGs [sustainable development goals], we cannot afford to dismantle funding mechanisms – like USAID – that have already proven to save millions of lives. Now is the time to scale up, not scale back.”",Global development; USAID; Aid; World news; Global health; Trump administration; Barack Obama; George Bush; US news; US politics,Global development
2025-07-06T05:00:30Z,"The UN is our best defence against a third world war. As Trump wields the axe, who will fight to save it? | Simon Tisdall",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/06/the-un-is-our-best-defence-against-a-third-world-war-as-trump-wields-the-axe-who-will-fight-to-save-it,"The United Nations and its agencies have long struggled with funding shortfalls. Now an entrenched problem is becoming an acute crisis in the shadow of Donald Trump’s executioner’s axe. The US is the biggest contributor, at 22%, to the UN’s core budget. In February, the White House announced a six-month review of US membership of all international organisations, conventions and treaties, including the UN, with a view to reducing or ending funding – and possible withdrawal. The deadline for decapitation falls next month. Trump’s abolition of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and scrapping of most aid programmes, has already badly damaged UN-led and UN-backed humanitarian operations, which rely on discretionary funding. Yet Trump’s axe symbolises a more fundamental threat – to multilateralism and the much-battered international rules-based order. The basic concept of collective responsibility for maintaining global peace and security, and collaboration in tackling shared problems – embodied by the UN since its creation 80 years ago last week – is on the chopping block. The stakes are high – and Washington is not the only villain. Like the US, about 40 countries are behind in paying obligatory yearly dues. Discretionary donations are declining. The UN charter, a statement of founding principles, has been critically undermined by failure to halt Russia’s illegal war of aggression in Ukraine (and by last month’s US-Israeli attack on Iran). China and others, including the UK, ignore international law when it suits. The number and longevity of conflicts worldwide is rising; UN envoys are sidelined; UN peacekeeping missions are disparaged. The security council is often paralysed by vetoes; the general assembly is largely powerless. By many measures, the UN isn’t working. A crunch looms. If the UN is allowed to fail or is so diminished that its agencies cannot fully function, there is nothing to take its place. Nothing, that is, except the law of the jungle, as seen in Gaza and other conflict zones where UN agencies are excluded, aid workers murdered and legal norms flouted. The UN system has many failings, some self-inflicted. But a world without the UN would, for most people in most places, be more dangerous, hungrier, poorer, unhealthier and less sustainable. The US is not expected to withdraw from the UN altogether (although nothing is impossible with this isolationist, ultra-nationalist president). But Trump’s hostile intent is evident. His 2026 budget proposal seeks a 83.7% cut – from $58.7bn to $9.6bn – in all US international spending. That includes an 87% reduction in UN funding, both obligatory and discretionary. “In 2023, total US spending on the UN amounted to about $13bn. This is equivalent to only 1.6% of the Pentagon’s budget that year ($816bn) – or about two-thirds of what Americans spend on ice-cream annually,” Stewart Patrick of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace noted. Economic development aid, disaster relief and family planning programmes would be gutted. The impact is potentially world-changing. Key UN agencies in the firing line include the children’s fund, Unicef – at a time when the risks facing infants and children are daunting; the World Food Programme (WFP), which could lose 30% of its staff; agencies handling refugees and migration, which are also shrinking; the International court of justice (the “world court”), which has shone a light on Israel’s illegal actions in Gaza; and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors Iran’s and others’ nuclear activities. Trump is already boycotting the World Health Organization, the Palestinian relief agency (Unrwa) and the UN Human Rights Council, and has rescinded $4bn allocated to the UN climate fund, claiming that all act contrary to US interests. If his budget is adopted this autumn, the UN’s 2030 sustainable development goals may prove unattainable. US financial backing for international peacekeeping and observer missions in trouble spots such as Lebanon, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Kosovo, currently 26% of total spending, will plunge to zero. The withdrawal of USAID support is already proving lethal, everywhere from Somalia and Sudan to Bangladesh and Haiti. UN officials describe the situation in post-earthquake, conflict-riven, aid-deprived Myanamar as a “humanitarian catastrophe”. Research published in the Lancet found that Trump’s cuts could cause more than 14m additional deaths by 2030, a third of them children. The WFP, the world’s largest food aid supplier, says its projected $8.1bn funding deficit this year comes as acute hunger affects a record 343 million people in 74 countries. And other donor states are failing to fill the gap left by the US. So far in 2025, only 11% of the $46.2bn required for 44 UN-prioritised crises has been raised. The UK recently slashed its aid budget by £6bn, to pay for nuclear bombs. UN chiefs acknowledge that many problems pre-date Trump. António Guterres, the secretary general, has initiated thousands of job cuts as part of the “UN80” reform plan to consolidate operations and reduce the core budget by up to 20%. But, marking the anniversary, Guterres said the gravest challenge is the destructive attitude of member states that sabotage multilateral cooperation, break the rules, fail to pay their share and forget why the UN was founded in the first place. “The charter of the United Nations is not optional. It is not an à la carte menu. It is the bedrock of international relations,” he said. Guterres says the UN’s greatest achievement since 1945 is preventing a third world war. Yet respected analysts such as Fiona Hill believe it’s already begun. The UK and other democracies face some pressing questions. Will they meekly give in to Trump once again? Or will they fight to stop this renegade president and rogue states such as Russia and Israel dismantling the world’s best defence against global anarchy, forever wars and needless suffering? Will they fight to save the UN? Simon Tisdall is a Guardian columnist",United Nations; Trump administration; USAID; Aid; US politics; US news; World news,Opinion
2023-09-18T21:20:34Z,Western leaders defend slow progress to end global inequality as UN summit starts,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/18/un-summit-sees-western-leaders-defend-slow-progress-to-end-global-inequality,"Western leaders have gone on a charm offensive on the opening day of the UN general assembly as they were forced to defend their record in meeting the organisation’s sustainable development goals (SDGs), and insist that the war in Ukraine had not distracted them from this commitment to end global inequality. At a special summit in New York amounting to a halfway stocktake on progress towards meeting the goals by the target date of 2030, all sides acknowledged there was little chance that the ambitious set of commitments set in 2015, including ending extreme poverty and safeguarding the environment, will be met on schedule. A plea by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, for all sides to avoid recriminations about the cause of the failure and instead to use the two-day summit as a chance to make a global rescue plan was only partially met on the opening day. The list of 17 SDGs, which includes 169 specific targets, was first adopted at the UN sustainable development summit in September 2015, and most assessments say only 15% of the targets are on track. The leaders adopted a 43-paragraph political declaration, brokered by Ireland and Qatar, that warned years of sustainable development gains were being reversed. It said: “Millions of people have fallen into poverty, hunger and malnutrition are becoming more prevalent, humanitarian needs are rising, and the impacts of climate change are more pronounced. This has led to increased inequality exacerbated by weakened international solidarity and a shortfall of trust to jointly overcome these crises.” “Instead of leaving no one behind, we risk leaving the SDGs behind … the SDGs need a global rescue plan,” Guterres told the summit. Guterres was able to see off a last-minute démarche – led by Russia and an alliance of only nine countries wanting to insert opposition to the use of unilateral sanctions into the declaration. The UN said this month that there were 745 million more people either moderately or severely hungry in the world today than in 2015, and the world was far off track in its efforts to meet the ambitious goal to end hunger by 2030. The world was back at hunger levels not seen since 2005, and food prices remained higher in more countries than in the period 2015–19. On current progress it would also take 286 years to close the proposed gender gaps in legal protection and remove discriminatory laws. The solutions laid out in the political declaration are broad, covering financing for developing countries including clear support for Guterres’s proposal for an SDG stimulus of at least $500bn annually, as well as a more effective debt-relief mechanism. The declaration also calls for changing the business model of multilateral development banks to offer private finance at more affordable rates for developing countries, and endorses reform of the international finance architecture which Guterrres has labelled “outdated, dysfunctional and unfair”. Dennis Francis, the president of the UN general assembly, said: “In the recent past there has been an unfortunate deficit of trust and this has undermined the capacity of the multilateral process.” Francis said “wounds still lingered over the handling of the pandemic”, reflecting a belief that affluent countries cherrypicked the targets they could meet. He insisted, however: “With concerted, ambitious action, it is still possible that, by 2030, we could lift 124 million additional people out of poverty and ensure that some 113 million fewer people are malnourished.” The agenda of the entire UN this week has been shaped to meet the concerns of the global south, including a separate climate summit on Wednesday, and it is evident that western powers – in an effort to counter Russian and Chinese influence – have in their round of bilateral and multilateral meetings put a heavy emphasis on the concerns of poorer countries. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is expected to meet the sceptical Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, on Wednesday in an effort to convince him that the war in Ukraine is not an obstacle to progress for the world’s poor, and that Ukraine’s fate is a legitimate matter for the world, not just Europe. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, also admitted there had been a western failure in efforts to ensure sustainable development for the planet. He said: “We see that the progress we wanted for the whole world in the fight against poverty and for better coexistence has become slower.” Catherine Colonna, the French foreign minister, said she wanted to avoid a north-south fracture and emphasised France’s role in building its aid budget and a new global financial pact. She went on the offensive, attacking Russia for its role in worsening the food scarcity crisis by bombing Ukraine’s grain stores. She said: “The world can be broken down to those who destroy and threaten and those who build and feed. France is part of the coalition who help to make everyone not go hungry.” She said Russia’s efforts to present itself as a member of the global south, a term she said she disliked, were designed to mislead. But the strength of the diplomatic olive branch to the global south was weakened by the glaring absence of two European leaders: Rishi Sunak, the British prime minister, and Emmanuel Macron, the French president. France’s mission to the UN said Macron had a scheduling conflict, hosting Britain’s King Charles III in Paris this week. The outreach at the general assembly is likely to be matched in coming months by that of European governments undertaking to meet smaller countries that have often been bypassed by high-ranking European ministers, let alone heads of state. Earlier this year 10 European countries, including Belgium and Slovenia, urged the EU high representative, Josep Borrell, to coordinate a diplomatic campaign to woo countries that have felt ignored, citing the need to do a better job of competing with China and Russia in what Borrell has described as a “battle of narratives”.",United Nations; Sustainable development goals; Global development; US news; Hunger; Ukraine; World news,World news
2024-09-21T06:00:34Z,UN chief António Guterres to seek world leaders’ backing for vision of the future,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/21/un-chief-antonio-guterres-to-seek-world-leaders-backing-for-vision-of-the-future,"The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, will try to persuade world leaders to extend their horizons beyond current wars by adopting a pact that he hopes will set a path for a new system of global governance that can prevent similar crises in the future. Global leaders will gather in New York next week for the UN Summit of the Future, the centrepiece of this year’s launch of the annual United Nations general assembly. Guterres had outlined an ambitious agenda covering artificial intelligence, groundbreaking UN security council reform, outer space, peace operations, climate change and financing development, but critics say that outline has not so much shrunk as become ever-less specific. The toll of grinding negotiations and the need for consensus have underlined the divisions that have immobilised the UN for a decade, leading to a watered-down document called “pact for the future” due to be announced at a summit. Talks about the final draft, its five chapters and 58 actions must end on Saturday. For more than a year Guterres had hoped that by confronting world leaders with the scale of the future challenges they collectively face, they could be persuaded to set aside some of those divisions about the present. Guy Ryder, the UN undersecretary for policy who is at the helm of the process, insists the pact “can render the UN and the multilateral system more effective, participatory and networked”, but at briefings he struggled to convince reporters this was not another UN mission statement that will gather dust similar to the 2015 sustainable development goals summit or the Nelson Mandela peace summit in 2018. At a press conference Guterres called for the current generation of peacebuilders to address challenges not visible when the UN was invented as a much smaller body 80 years ago. “International challenges are moving faster than our ability to solve them. We see out-of-control geopolitical divisions and runaway conflicts – not least in Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan and beyond. Runaway climate change. Runaway inequalities and debt. Runaway development of new technologies like artificial intelligence – without guidance or guardrails. And our institutions simply can’t keep up,” he said. “Crises are interacting and feeding off each other – for example, as digital technologies spread climate disinformation that deepens distrust and fuels polarisation. Global institutions and frameworks are today totally inadequate to deal with these complex and even existential challenges. “It is no great surprise. Those institutions were born in a bygone era for a bygone world.” Few disagree with his analysis, but many question whether the pact provides new solutions, as opposed to aspirations. Guterres insisted it represented progress, saying it offers “the strongest language on security council reform in a generation – and the most concrete step towards council enlargement since 1963. The first set of governance measures for new technologies, including artificial intelligence, in all their applications – with the UN at its centre. A major advance in reform of the international financial architecture with the most significant language yet strengthening the role of developing countries. A step change in financing the sustainable development goals and a commitment to advance our [sustainable development goals] stimulus, multiplying the resources available to developing countries.” David Miliband, the chief executive of International Rescue Committee, said the pact did include practical proposals, such as an emergency platform allowing the UN to use its convening power to address global shocks such as pandemics. He said his test for the pact was “not novelty but strength, commitment and follow-through in a world where the nature of global risk has changed”. But the negotiators have confronted familiar problems including cold war standoffs, shortage of cash and entrenched western reluctance to cede power to emerging powers – at the security council and in financial institutions. Seeking consensus among 193 countries has been no easy task for the two facilitators, Germany and Namibia. Nor has the backdrop of wars in Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan helped the atmosphere. Various critics have said the UN pact is not the right place to settle specific differences. Russia has opposed overspecific references to nuclear disarmament. Others have said the Cop conferences are the only place to address the climate crisis. Richard Gowan, the UN specialist at the International Crisis Group, said there was a western reluctance to address the imbalances in the multilateral financial bodies. In a paper for Chatham House thinktank he observed: “The US and its allies argue that the UN is not the right space to negotiate complex financial issues. They say the World Bank and [International Monetary Fund] – where western powers still hold decisive shares of the votes – have a mandate to address these topics. A lot of diplomats from poorer states will be happy if world leaders make political commitments to sort out debt and development issues at the summit. But some hardliners, such as Pakistan, have argued that is not enough, and have even suggested cancelling the summit.” There are some signs of movement on security council reform where three of the five permanent members on the 15-strong council are France, the UK and the US. The US has suggested creating two new permanent seats for African countries without veto power. But India and Brazil’s claims are also pressing. On the theme of expansion of the security council, an answer may eventually be found. Ingenious solutions to reduce the veto of the permanent members abound, only to be crushed on the rock of objections from Russia, US and China, and a slow migration is visible to greater use of the larger general assembly where the veto does not apply. But the speed of reform does not match the speed with which the world – its technology and power dynamics – is changing. At best Gowan argues the pact can provide a hook or staging post for UN reform, and for new issues such as AI to proceed at future summits. Miliband said the UN system could only be as good as its members. He said: “Fragmentation of political power around the world is producing gridlock at the apex of the international system: the UN security council.”",United Nations; António Guterres; World news,World news
2025-02-12T14:00:28Z,Share of wealth held by Australia’s poorest falls sharply since 2004 – report,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/12/share-of-wealth-held-by-australias-poorest-falls-by-almost-30-since-2004-report,"The share of wealth held by Australia’s bottom 40% has declined sharply in the last two decades while 3.3 million live below the poverty line, a damning report into Australia’s track record on quality of life has revealed. Monash University’s third Transforming Australia report, released on Thursday, shows progress on more than half of the 80 indicators has stalled or is in freefall, painting a deteriorating picture of the country’s social, economic and environmental wellbeing. Without a change of course, including a focus on long-term policymaking beyond the three-year federal election cycle, Australia will continue to lag behind the developed world, the report warns. The report, which uses long-term data sources to analyse Australia’s development over the years, found inequalities across wealth, housing, health and education were worsening. More than 3 million Australians, or 12.7%, lived below the poverty line, according to 2020 data, putting Australia above the OECD average of 12.1% and peer countries, such as Canada (8.6%) and the UK (11.2%). Australia’s ratings worsened in both wealth and income inequality. The share of the country’s wealth held by the bottom 40% of society declined from 7.8% in 2004 to about 5.5% in 2020. The report’s analysis showed almost 24% of Australia’s wealth was held by the top 1% of income-earners, while the top 10% had 57% of the country’s wealth. Australia fared better than the US, where 34.9% of its wealth was held by the top 1% and 70.7% by the top 10%. The report’s lead researcher, Cameron Allen, said the accumulation of wealth had happened slowly over the 16 years from 2004 to 2020 but was evident in the long-term data. “If you have widening disparities between education outcomes of rich and poor students, for example, then over time, that leads to entrenched disadvantage, and ultimately lower incomes and wealth inequality,” he told Guardian Australia. “You can see what happens when you don’t take action to address inequalities over time – that can lead to a lack of trust, a lack of social cohesion and, ultimately, polarisation.” Equality in the level of mathematics proficiency between students from low and high socioeconomic backgrounds declined by 25% since 2018 and 34% since 2000. The trend places Australia below the US, the UK and Germany. The report does note the country’s positive standings in life expectancy, superannuation gender gaps, share of renewable energy, government net debt and low homicide rates. It estimates that on current projections, Australia will achieve only 55% of progress by 2050 on the sustainable development goals adopted by UN members in 2015. The goals are broadly defined as an end to poverty, protection of the planet, and peace and prosperity by 2030. But increased public expenditure and accountability mechanisms will be needed to achieve 80% of progress towards these goals by 2030 and 90% by 2050, the report recommends. It recommends a 7% increase in annual expenditure to 2030, financed through tax reforms, to boost investment in health, education, adaptation and resilience. Social transfers towards lower-income groups could halve the poverty rate and reduce income inequality by 30% by 2050, the modelling suggested. Allen said other measures, such as introducing a future generations commissioner to consult with governments on long-term planning and legislating targets, could focus politicians beyond the length of their terms. Increasing political terms beyond three years could also turn the trend on short-term policymaking, he added. “One of the problems at the federal level is that our election cycle is particularly short. It’s only three years so it barely gives elected officials time to implement things before they’re already in election mode again,” Allen said. “Ultimately, we need to look at other mechanisms to incentivise policymakers to think long-term. There are not many incentives at the moment to do that.”",Cost-of-living crisis; Inequality; Australian education; Australian politics; Australia news,Australia news
2025-05-29T12:15:29Z,"‘I don’t want freebies’: outgoing AfDB head on why investment, not aid, will shape Africa’s future",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/may/29/outgoing-afdb-head-african-development-bank-akinwumi-adesina-investment-not-aid-shape-future,"The man known as Africa’s “optimist-in-chief” faces one of his toughest challenges this year: handing over the reins of his beloved institution to his successor. After 10 years at the top of the African Development Bank, Akinwumi Adesina will this week see a new president elected at the bank’s annual meeting in Ivory Coast before a handover in September. Adesina will be passing on a bank that has grown dramatically during his tenure. “In 2015, the capital of the bank was $93bn. Today, the African Development Bank is $318bn.” In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, the 65-year-old Nigerian was characteristically upbeat about the continent’s future but realistic about the challenges, many of which, he says, stem from injustice in the way African countries are treated. “In terms of the taxes and royalties that Africa should be getting from its vast natural resources. Africa has oil, gas, minerals, metals; we have forest, we have everything. But we are not getting anything from it because international corporations and national corporations don’t pay the relevant taxes and royalties. So we need to make sure that is done. “We must have impatience with underdevelopment,” he says. The AfDB has been gaining prestige, ranked as the world’s best multilateral financial institution in 2021 by Global Finance and feted for its transparency in last year’s aid transparency index. Set up in 1964, it is a specialised financial institution focused on promoting economic and social progress, unlike a profit-driven commercial bank. “Whoever is taking over, they are certainly getting a walk-on global institution,” Adesina says. “But it’s not a job – it’s a mission. You have to breathe it. And Africa is watching.” “Multilateral financial institutions like ourselves were not set up to do Mickey Mouse stuff, little marginal stuff; no, we were set up to address global challenges. “Without infrastructure there is no trade. And so the bank, in the last 10 years, invested more than $55bn in infrastructure. “Scale matters. Impact matters. Delivery matters. But most importantly, you cannot get to where you could not envision – vision drives.” The aid budget cuts from the US, the UK and others are less of a concern to Adesina than the lack of fairness in how the world’s economic powers and risk assessors treat African countries. “If African countries were rated properly, equitably,” he says, “they would be paying $75bn less every year in terms of servicing their debts. “The president of Kenya, William Ruto, he told me something. He said when there was a military coup in Niger, he got information that Kenya had to pay an increased interest rate on their bonds – because there was a coup in Niger. “He said he told the person: ‘Well look, this is the map of Kenya. Where is Niger: inside it, or out or next to it?’ “Aid has helped countries that needed it, that are vulnerable. It has been good. There’s no doubt about that,” Adesina says. “But aid cannot be part of my balance sheet. “Benevolence is good; what benevolence is not is an asset class. But the future of Africa is going to come from investment, not aid. I don’t want freebies – I want Africa to develop with pride.” But Adesina remains resolutely positive. “I will always be optimistic about the future of Africa. God did not make a mistake when he made me an African. And I will ask God for permission to resurrect as an African. “My heart, my soul, my mind, is in advancing my continent’s development. If you look at the opportunities that we have, we have not even scratched it. “We have the largest population of youth in the world today,” he notes. “One out of four people in the world are going to be African by 2050. Africa will be the workshop of the world, brimming with talents, with opportunities for its young people. “You look at the size of our digital economy today. It’s roughly $180bn. But its going to go to $712bn by 2050. You have Africa urbanising more rapidly than any other region of the world. “What Africa does with agriculture will determine the future of food in the world. So why will I not be optimistic? That is the place to be. The question to ask is why are you not in Africa? If you are not in Africa, I wonder where you are.” Adesina hits out at the stereotype that investing in Africa is high risk. “Really? Is Africa that risky compared to others? No, the data doesn’t support that. “Bloomberg, and Moody’s Analytics did an assessment over 14 years: loss rates in Africa on industry investment, 1.9%. The case for North America, 6.6%. Latin America was 10%. For eastern Europe, over 12.2%. In western Asia, 4.6%. Western Europe, 4.6%. “Africa has the lowest,” he emphasises. “So the issue is understand Africa. We are there to support investors on this continent. And I know that Africa is the biggest greenfield investment frontier in the world. “When I came to the bank, I told myself, ‘this is the African Development Bank – the most important part is the development part.’ And so my focus was how do we accelerate development? “That was how I simplified it in a clear way into the ‘high fives’ of the bank: to light up and power Africa – electricity for everybody. To feed Africa. To industrialise, to integrate Africa and to improve the quality of life of the people – that means water, sanitation, education, skills, jobs. If Africa achieved these high fives, we would have achieved 90% of the UN sustainable development goals.” Adesina and Ajay Banga, president of the World Bank, last year launched Mission 300, a private-public collaboration to connect an additional 300 million sub-Saharan Africans – half of the 600 million living without electricity – to grids by 2030. Although proud of the big projects under way, including Africa’s largest wind-power scheme in Lake Turkana, Kenya, he says there is more to be done in the energy sector. “I’m excited about the level of political commitment I’m seeing from the heads of state,” he says. “Today, you have 10 out of the 20 fastest-growing economies in the world in Africa. So, it’s a pluralism of excitement about the future prospects and resilience of Africa. It’s not about emotion. It’s about the reality and the world cannot ignore Africa. “I’m fully confident that the stone that the builders rejected, will soon become one day the head cornerstone.” For the new president, he also wishes much energy. “My time ends 1 September,” he smiles. “There will be a note that I will leave to my successor, some ideas.”",Global development; Africa; Infrastructure; Access to energy; Investing; Business; World news; Economics; Least developed countries; Aid; Environmental sustainability; Renewable energy,Global development
2024-09-30T06:00:05Z,"In a tumultuous world, we rely on the United Nations more than ever – but it is failing | Jamal Benomar",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/sep/30/world-tumultuous-united-nations-leadership-flaws,"The United Nations Summit of the Future has concluded, but the real and present world remains on fire. With the UN general assembly now meeting – an annual ritual where dozens of heads of state descend on New York – key questions about the role and future of the United Nations remain unanswered. Israel’s devastating war in Gaza has spilled into Lebanon, 25 million are facing the possibility of starvation in conflict-torn Sudan, and the deadly war in Ukraine marches on. Created nearly 80 years ago to maintain international peace and security, the UN is failing to prevent or mediate any of these conflicts. The outcome document of the summit, the Pact for the Future, was agreed after lengthy and often acrimonious negotiations. It covers everything from culture and sports, the climate crisis and sustainable development goals to human rights, gender equality, ending poverty, social cohesion and peace and security. It extends to science and technology, youth, financial institutions reform, data governance, artificial intelligence and, believe it or not, even outer space. Yet most of the text is made up of rehashed and recycled wording from previously agreed UN documents. The language is vague and aspirational. There are hardly any concrete, actionable conclusions that could advance the lofty objectives of the summit. For example, in the section on peace and security, the outcome document fails to address the reasons for the accelerated decline of UN mediation and the crisis in UN peacekeeping in recent years. In one country after another, parties in conflict bypass or reject the good offices of the secretary general and call for the departure of peacekeeping operations. Instead of tackling these issues, the document calls for a “review” of peace operations and for more global meetings “to discuss matters pertaining to peace operations, peacebuilding and conflicts.” In classic UN tradition, when lacking answers or a path forward, the UN calls for more reports and meetings. At a time when mass atrocities and a breakdown of the rule of law are increasingly the norm – as seen in Gaza – the only “new” language in the document is a request to the secretary general to “assess the need” for more resources for its human rights office. Grandiose initiatives like the Summit of the Future are not new. Past secretary generals have called for global summits that did not achieve much. The late Boutros Boutros-Ghali should be credited for advancing UN reform with less fanfare. His 1992 Agenda for Peace paved the way for expanded UN peacekeeping operations, increased UN-led mediation and discreet conflict prevention efforts around the world, while trimming the bloated bureaucracy in the UN secretariat by abolishing more than one thousand posts. Under the late Kofi Annan’s leadership, 2005’s In Larger Freedom is credited with developing the concept of the sustainable development goals, the creation of a new peacebuilding architecture, and a new human rights council as an alternative to the discredited human rights commission. While these initiatives set forth both novel and concrete ideas, their impact has been limited. Former secretary general Ban Ki-moon, in his humble way, didn’t call for special summits. Instead, he effectively used existing global forums to champion the call for action on climate change. In contrast, the input of the current secretary general, António Guterres, into the Summit of the Future lacked focus, concrete and viable proposals, and courage. This led many observers to view it as a public relations exercise designed to keep the floundering image of the UN afloat and detract from its real failings. The summit was a missed opportunity to discuss some of the fundamental issues that have plagued the organisation. Among these are the deadlock in the security council and the lip service paid to reform by the permanent five members (China, France, the Russian Federation, the UK and the US); compliance with international law, impunity and the prevention of mass atrocities; the disappointing performance and flaws in the structure of the human rights council and the questionable performance of the peacebuilding commission. Neglected, too, has been the need to reinvent the role of the UN in peace and security and to reform a bloated UN bureaucracy built on patronage, with key secretariat departments controlled by three permanent member states. There is a need to review the role, the appointment of and the independence of the secretary general; and how the general assembly might be “reinvigorated” and opened up to non-state actors. Despite these flaws, the necessity for the UN is greater than ever in the face of new global threats to peace and the escalating challenges of the climate crisis. The thousands of UN staff deployed in hotspots around the world deserve our respect and recognition. They deserve greater leadership and vision as well.

2025-07-25T09:14:28Z,‘I’m ready to make an impact in the world of work’: how the University of Derby equips students for career success,https://www.theguardian.com/shaping-the-next-generation-of-gamechangers/2025/jul/25/how-university-of-derby-prepares-students-for-career-success,"Preparing students for the world of work is an ever-changing challenge for modern universities. At the University of Derby, a wholehearted commitment to applied learning ensures graduates enter the workforce armed not just with qualifications, but with the technical skills, confidence, connections, and mindset to succeed and achieve. Equipping students for the real world is at the very heart of the university’s purpose, according to Duncan Marson, programme leader and senior lecturer in tourism and applied management at the University of Derby. “Our students are not just leaving with an academic qualification,” he says. “They can be confident that they will graduate with the skills that employers seek. At Derby we have always taken great pride in our approach to teaching and learning and ensure our students leave with real-world readiness and the tools they need to be successful.” Futureproofing students and supporting them to thrive within an unpredictable jobs market is one of the many passions of both Marson and the wider academic team, and it underpins everything on offer at the university’s Derby International Business School. From teaching placements to ongoing career support for graduates, the emphasis is firmly on career readiness, not just academic performance. “At the University of Derby, every module we teach and every project we deliver is grounded in applied learning. It’s industry-linked, often shaped directly by the challenges businesses are facing right now and those anticipated in the future too.” The university’s new Cavendish Building – the soon-to-be home of Derby International Business School – is set to provide an exceptional learning environment and has been designed with a “living lab” ethos in mind. A centre for innovation, circular economy projects, and hands-on learning, it’s planned to change the way students engage with issues such as sustainability. “Teaching modules are mapped to the UN sustainable development goals,” says Marson. “We’re part of the SDG Teach In initiative, and that focus on sustainability – both environmental as well as the inevitable economic parameters – runs through everything we do.” Derby’s rich industrial heritage – particularly in engineering, rail, and aerospace – is a huge influence on the university. This is reflected in pioneering enterprise partnerships. Rolls-Royce, which has operated a manufacturing facility in Derby for more than 60 years, recently co-developed an international business and AI degree with the university, inspired by research from Derby’s Sustainable Business and Green Growth Research Cluster. While the location of the university in the East Midlands is of profound importance, the University of Derby retains a distinctly global focus. “Our students get to work on projects with organisations all over the world, including the Bank of England, the FA, and Boots, as well as Marketing Derby, which is focused on generating inward investment into the city and takes a very global approach to doing so,” says Marson. As well as supporting international enterprise, the University of Derby champions regional SMEs – an approach that earned it the small business charter, the national accolade that recognises excellence in SME support. It’s well documented that businesses must establish a robust talent pipeline in order to survive. In response, the university tailors its curriculum to ensure it is aligned with changing industry needs. Max Smith, who graduated from the University of Derby this summer with a first-class degree in business management, credits the university’s career-focused approach with preparing him not just for work, but for life. Having secured a role with Alstom, a supplier of trains and train services, Smith believes the University of Derby’s commitment to real-world, applied learning helped sharpen his career and ensured he stood out when applying for the role. “The careers and employment service were a great help,” he says. “A lot of praise goes to them. They helped completely restructure my CV, and even launched an initiative where you could pick up smart clothes for interviews if you needed them.” Originally from Poland, Natalia Jarczyńska graduated from the University of Derby with a BA (hons) in business management and is now a senior analyst at Goldman Sachs in the US. Jarczyńska says the University of Derby’s practical approach not only helped her develop vital business acumen but crucial soft skills – including active listening, communication, and adaptability – that she uses daily in New York’s financial district. “At Derby, we didn’t just write essays,” Jarczyńska says. “We pitched to clients, worked on real problems, and got feedback from actual stakeholders. That gave me confidence and communication skills that I use every day. Derby gave me a foundation few other universities offer.” Should she ever wish to further her academic qualifications, Jarczyńska says she would think about returning to the East Midlands. “In terms of my career goals, I want to stay in finance, but if I ever think about doing an MBA or maybe a PhD in future, I will definitely consider returning to Derby, that’s for sure,” she says, underscoring the university’s impact on her both professionally and personally. The University of Derby empowers students to hit the ground running when they graduate, but its commitment to employability doesn’t end there. Graduates can continue accessing career services – including job hunting, networking, CV advice, and mentoring from industry leaders – for up to three years after they graduate. For students like Smith, the impact of studying at Derby is profound and long-lasting. “I feel ready to step into the job market and make an impact,” he says. “Derby doesn’t just teach you for exams – it teaches you for life.” ‘Derby helped create a safe, nurturing space for me to grow’ Los Angeles-born Tyra Tucker graduated from the University of Derby in 2020 with a degree in international relations and diplomacy. Now living in the UK, she works as a civil servant. While studying at Derby, Tucker joined one of the university’s business development programmes, which offered workshops, mentors, one‑on‑one support, and grant funding to help students launch their own ventures. Inspired by her entrepreneurial mother, Tucker had an idea for a cultural platform and attended additional classes through the programme on design, finance, and marketing. She then registered her business, secured mentoring, and qualified for a startup grant, which enabled her to assemble a small paid team of student interns – a videographer, marketer, and social media coordinator – to help launch a multimedia site dedicated to global culture. A turning point came when her mentor persuaded her to pitch at a university showcase. Nervous but encouraged, Tucker presented to a live audience and won decisively with 42% of the vote – a moment that built her creative confidence and strengthened her belief in her business. Tucker says Derby didn’t just nudge her into entrepreneurship – it equipped her. Through practical training, mentor support, collaborative teams, and a “just start” culture, Tucker learned to “stop over‑perfecting” at the same time as developing her practical skills, such as how to manage finances. Her advice to current students is simple.“Now is the best time to start something,” she says – university offers the time, creative community, and entrepreneurial freedom that can vanish after graduation. Looking back, Tucker says that Derby didn’t confine her – it “unboxed” her. She arrived with ideas and passion, and left with tangible achievements, experience, confidence, a professional network, and enduring support that continues to this day, long after she graduated and moved into the world of work. “I walked in with ideas and walked out knowing they mattered,” she says. “Confidence isn’t built by dreaming but by doing,” she adds. “Derby helped me to tap into what was already within me and created a safe, nurturing space for me to grow without limit.” Tucker’s current role proves that creative student ideas, supported by the structure and community on offer at Derby, are laying the groundwork for real-world leadership.

2023-09-17T04:00:49Z,Rifts over Ukraine disrupt UN summit on crises in the global south,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/17/rifts-over-ukraine-disrupt-un-summit-on-crises-in-the-global-south,"This year’s UN general assembly is supposed to be about the global south, addressing the social and economic development issues that many of the world’s poorer countries felt were forgotten last year in the uproar over Ukraine. That was the intention at least, but the global rifts caused by Russia’s invasion still threaten to take centre stage. The US and its western allies have acknowledged that they cannot take the broad support of the bulk of UN members for granted in opposing Moscow’s war without paying greater attention to the priorities of the UN’s Group of 77 (G77), a loose coalition of developing countries. The coming “high-level week” at the general assembly will start with a two-day meeting on sustainable development goals (SDGs). These 17 goals – such as the eradication of poverty and hunger, and the universal provision of good healthcare and education – were set out by UN member states in 2015, with a goal for their achievement by 2030. This general assembly marks the halfway point in their progress, and the world is on track to meet only 12% of the targets. Half a billion people are likely still to be living in poverty in 2030. Nearly 100 million children will not be in school. In some areas, progress has gone into reverse. This week’s summit on Monday and Tuesday is intended to refocus concerted international effort on them. The US envoy to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, accused America’s rivals of peddling “false narratives about the US commitment to the SDGs”. She told the Council on Foreign Relations on Friday that these rivals “want to drive a wedge between developing countries and the US because they want developing countries to think we only care about great power competition, and because they want to seed the narrative that the United States only pays lip service to the SDGs”. The Biden administration will seek to use the SDG summit to prove it remains a champion of the UN’s highest aspirations. There will also be a joint announcement by Joe Biden and the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, on economic security and job creation, which reflects an effort by the US to find common ground with a Latin American power that has been ambivalent at best in its stand on the Ukraine war. On Wednesday, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, will host a climate ambition summit at a time when the world is way behind where it needs to be to limit global warming to 1.5C, the goal set in the 2015 Paris agreement. On Thursday, there will be a ministerial meeting to plan for Guterres’ planned summit of the future next September, which is aimed at reshaping global governance so it can better deal with the threats facing the planet. The greatest geopolitical drama of the week, however, is expected to spring from the presence of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who will address the general assembly in person for the first time. He will be among the first speakers, appearing on Tuesday morning, not long after Lula and Biden (Brazil and the US are traditionally the first and second heads of state to address the assembly). On Wednesday, Zelenskiy will address a security council meeting on the war in Ukraine, which is also due to be attended by the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. That does not necessarily mean there will be a personal confrontation. Last year, Lavrov entered the council chamber to deliver his remarks and then left. But an unplanned close encounter is always possible. Richard Gowan, the UN director at the International Crisis Group, described Zelenskiy’s decision to attend the general assembly in the flesh as a gamble at a time when there is growing pressure, especially from G77 states, to agree a ceasefire while just under a fifth of Ukrainian territory is under occupation. “We shouldn’t underestimate the element of risk,” Gowan said. “If Zelenskiy goes to the general assembly and to the security council, and insists that Ukraine has to fight on, and that this is not a moment for diplomacy, I think that he will get a lot of pushback.” Zelenskiy’s strategy in recent months, rather than allow his government to be portrayed as “against peace”, has been to launch his own initiative to pursue a settlement founded on the principles of the UN Charter, national sovereignty and territorial integrity that almost all UN member states claim to uphold. The US, Ukraine and their allies will also emphasise the impact of Russian aggression on G77 countries, most importantly in the form of the Black Sea grain initiative, which was supposed to provide safe passage for Ukrainian cereal exports. Vladimir Putin’s withdrawal from the initiative in July led to a spike in grain prices and had a direct impact on the World Food Programme’s capacity to feed populations threatened by famine in some of the world’s poorest countries. Turkish-led attempts to persuade Putin to change his mind have failed, and Ukraine’s backers will point to that refusal to pile up pressure on Russia this week. Caitlin Welsh, director of the global food and water security programme at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, believes Putin is highly unlikely to bow to that pressure. “Russia sees nearly all upside and very little downside in remaining outside of the agreement. The upside that Russia sees is that Russia benefits from the destruction of Ukraine’s agriculture sector,” Welsh said. The diversion of Ukrainian grain exports westwards has also aroused protectionist responses from European farmers. “Russia also sees upside in disunity within the EU with regard to trade disruptions,” Welsh said. The launching of the Black Sea grain initiative in July last year was a highlight of Guterres’ tenure as secretary general, and its collapse is a setback both for his leadership and for the UN as a whole. It comes at a time when the UN is struggling to justify its preeminence among a proliferation of international groups based on regional geography and common interests. It is also a blow that only one leader from the five permanent security council members, Biden, will attend in person. Putin and China’s Xi Jinping rarely show up anyway, but this year French president Emmanuel Macron and Britain’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, will also be absent. The absence of global leaders comes at a time when the organisation has proved impotent in stopping major conflicts in Ukraine and Sudan, and the international community is falling well short of the goals the UN set for combating poverty, disease, famine and catastrophic climate change. “The situation of the UN now is bleak and I think it is markedly bleaker than at the 2022 high-level week,” Gowan said. “A year on, it feels like we are a lot closer to a cliff edge.”",United Nations; Ukraine; Russia; Volodymyr Zelenskyy; Joe Biden; Sustainable development goals; World news; Global development,World news
2025-02-22T08:00:03Z,"If road deaths were a virus, we’d call it a pandemic. Safer transport helps us all – and we need it urgently | Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and Jean Todt",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/feb/22/sustainable-transport-development-road-deaths-un-urban-planning,"If you had to guess the leading cause of death for children and young people around the world, what would you say? Malaria perhaps? Pneumonia? Suicide? They’re all high up there, but no, it’s road accidents. Cars have been around for more than 120 years, and we know how to prevent these tragedies. Yet road crashes still claim more than two lives every minute – killing nearly 1.2 million people every year. If these deaths were caused by a virus, it would be called a pandemic and the world would scramble to develop a vaccine to prevent them. And yet reducing road deaths has long been overlooked, misunderstood and underfunded. People will always make mistakes on the roads but we have proven solutions that ensure our transport systems can absorb these errors in a way that significantly reduces the risk of death. As part of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the UN Decade of Action for Road Safety, the world has set an ambitious target of halving deaths on the road worldwide by 2030. Just 10 countries – including some hard-hit poorer countries – managed to reduce road deaths by more than 50% in the previous decade of action, and more than 30 countries are close behind. This shows that the target can be met but it is nowhere near enough. We need urgent action. Key to meeting this goal is the decision to design and build our transport systems for people – not for motor vehicles – and to make safety paramount in all decisions. This is especially important for the most vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists and motorbike riders, who are often left dangerously exposed. Advancing road safety is crucial in itself, but it is also key to sustainable development overall. The world is going through an unprecedented wave of motorisation. More than a billion vehicles are on the roads. This is unsustainable, so we must focus on moving people, not cars, motorbikes and trucks. Transport accounts for a quarter of global carbon emissions and fuels congestion in our cities. Yet when mobility is made safe and accessible, people choose the greener options of public transport, walking and cycling. Designing cities around sustainable transport – with cycle lanes, pedestrian zones and fully accessible public transport – also strengthens communities by making urban spaces safer and more livable, while improving access to adequate housing and basic services for all. Safe roads power economies. Deaths on the road can cost countries about 3% to 5% of GDP, and ensuring more people can travel safely to their work, schools and vital services helps drive development. Safe, accessible and affordable transport also breaks down barriers to jobs, education and opportunities for disadvantaged groups. This helps ensure everyone can reach their potential. The same holds true for gender equality. In some countries, up to 80% of women report suffering harassment on public transport, so we must make transport safe for female passengers. Road safety is everyone’s business and to succeed we need a range of sectors to be involved. Urban planners and engineers must ensure safety is built into infrastructure. Academia and civil society can generate evidence. The media can dig deeper into what works, as well as what does not and why. The private sector has tremendous influence. Businesses can contribute to safe and sustainable mobility by applying proven principles and practices throughout their activities and only selling vehicles that meet established safety standards. Yet the role of government is paramount. Governments must provide strategic and well-coordinated approaches, strong policy and legal frameworks that enforce safety standards and safe behaviours, and sufficient funding. Law enforcement and education are also key. This vision is right at the heart of the plan for the UN Decade of Action for Road Safety 2021-30, which offers a blueprint for governments. This week, world leaders met for the 4th Global Ministerial Conference on Road Safety in Morocco to assess progress, share knowledge and advance actions to halve road deaths by 2030. They have adopted the new Marrakech Declaration, which recognises road safety as an urgent public health and development priority, and that our efforts must be guided by the principles of equity, accessibility and sustainability. The declaration calls on leaders to step up efforts. We need a step-change in political will, a sense of urgency, evidence-based strategies that are costed and implemented, strong coordination and adequate financing. Road safety is a crisis that has gone on far too long. No road deaths are necessary or acceptable. Yet it is also much more than that. Safe and sustainable mobility can power a better future for us all.

2024-06-18T06:00:06Z, From Silicon Valley to Silicon Savannah: climate expert Patrick Verkooijen on why this is Africa’s century,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jun/18/patrick-verkooijen-nairobi-university-gca-climate-adaptation-africa-silicon-savannah-global-north-ai-green-jobs,"Africa has all the potential to meet pressing climate challenges with innovative solutions, according to one of the world’s renowned environmentalists. With its vast natural capital and youthful population, “this is Africa’s century,” according to Prof Patrick Verkooijen, chief executive of the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA), and the new chancellor of the University of Nairobi. But Verkooijen emphasises that support and investment from the global north is essential, highlighting that 65% of the world’s uncultivated land is in Africa, a continent with immense promise in its population, set to make up one in four people globally by 2050. He described a “train wreck” scenario for the entire global south if promises made by the global north were not fulfilled before the Cop30 summit in Brazil in November 2025. Verkooijen says global climate finance for adaptation was supposed to double by 2025 but is instead declining, jeopardising the UN’s sustainable development goals and threatening investment already made in resilience solutions. “If you don’t invest in climate adaptation, how do you capitalise on opportunities for job creation, green growth and avoided losses?” he says. The GCA, headquartered in the Netherlands, with offices in Ivory Coast, China and Bangladesh, is an international organisation working on climate adaptation worldwide, calling itself a “solutions broker”, and providing analysis on climate-proofing and food security. “Every project without a climate lens is a wasted project,” says Verkooijen. Partnering with governments and institutions such as the World Bank to integrate climate adaptation expertise into their projects, GCA’s portfolio boasts $9bn (£7bn) in climate-proofed projects in Africa alone. Verkooijen says GCA’s role is threefold: political mobilisation, providing climate-risk analysis and ensuring climate-proof development. Chaired by the former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, its supervisory board includes Macky Sall, the former president of Senegal. Advisory board members include the president of Kenya, William Ruto; the prime minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley; Tanzania’s president, Samia Suluhu Hassan; and the president of the African Development Bank, Akinwumi Adesina. “We mobilise heads of state to talk about adaptation,” says Verkooijen, “because if they don’t, others won’t, and nothing will happen. “In 2021, at Glasgow’s climate summit, climate adaptation was recognised as a central component of the climate crises debate for the first time.” But, he says, one of GCA’s significant hurdles remains finance. “Climate finance for adaptation was supposed to double by 2025, but we’re seeing the numbers go down,” Verkooijen says. “The reality is national governments in sub-Saharan Africa do their part. They pay twice as much on adaptation than they receive in bilateral aid. It’s a scandalous reality as they only emit 3% of greenhouse gas emissions yet suffer disproportionately from climate impacts.” The global north had failed to honour commitments to double adaptation finance while the shortfall threatened to derail sustainable development goals in Africa, he says. “GCA hosted an African adaptation summit in Rotterdam two years ago. African heads of state came to the Netherlands, where they met leaders from the global north and said: ‘We come here not as beggars, but for a partnership.’ The Africa adaptation acceleration programme [AAAP] was placed on the table. It’s now the largest adaptation programme in the world.” The AAAP, co-designed by the Africa Development Bank and GCA, and endorsed by the African Union, mobilises a $25bn initiative to accelerate climate change adaptation across Africa. Despite its scale, it is a drop in the bucket compared with the $100bn needed annually for adaptation in Africa. “We’re only receiving $10bn from the global north for adaptation, far below what is required,” Verkooijen stresses. GCA’s work includes large-scale projects designed to protect vulnerable communities and infrastructure. For instance, it analyses significant developments such as the highway between Nairobi and Mombasa and “ensures projects are climate-proofed”, says Verkooijen. As the newly appointed chancellor of the University of Nairobi, the first non-African to hold the post, Verkooijen is also tasked with transforming the institution into a global player. He is focused on the university’s “big five” initiatives: innovation, green jobs, AI, leadership and health research. “If one million young Africans enter the labour market every month, where are the jobs of the future? It is in the fourth industrial revolution and the green space. We are creating ‘Silicon Savannah’, a hub for startups and venture capitalists, mirroring Silicon Valley’s success,” he says. Verkooijen stresses the importance of international partnerships, particularly in fiscally constrained environments. “The University of Nairobi aims to serve Africa and be a global player, but financial streams from the government will not increase,” he says, meaning the university must attract global support. He considers his role a “transmission belt” for harnessing international collaboration. Looking towards November’s Cop30, he says the stakes are high. “There is no way for the UN’s sustainable development goals to be achieved in Africa without putting adaptation at its heart.”",Global development; Climate finance; Africa; Climate crisis; Environment; World news; Green economy; Silicon Valley; Technology; Artificial intelligence (AI); Universities; Higher education; Kenya; Climate aid; Greenhouse gas emissions; Green jobs; Mia Mottley; African Union; Education,Global development
2025-03-03T06:00:29Z,"‘I focus on the person, not the disability’: the photographer on a mission to make India inclusive",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/mar/03/i-focus-on-the-person-not-the-disability-the-photographer-on-a-mission-to-make-india-inclusive,"For Bikram Bhattarai, getting to school meant being carried by his father, Narpati, across the hilly terrain of Gangtok in the north Indian region of Sikkim. The half-hour journey each way was especially treacherous when the rains came and Bhattarai, who was born without arms, sometimes had to ask classmates to help carry him, too. Now in his twenties, he is at college studying history and enjoys writing poetry and listening to rappers including Eminem and Nepal’s Yama Buddha. But his true passion is art, he says, as he shares a sketch of an open palm holding a butterfly, drawn with his feet. Bikram Bhattarai, a college student from Gangtok in Sikkim who was born without arms, loves art and has taught himself to draw with his feet “Seeing my big sister inspired me. Seeing how she used her hands, I started using my toes the same way,” says Bhattarai. His story is one of 100 collected in a new book by photographer Vicky Roy, who has spent four years travelling across India’s 28 states and eight territories capturing the experiences of people living with the 21 disabilities recognised by the Indian government. For the project, Roy spends a day with each subject and their stories are translated and published, one a week, by volunteers. “I focus on the person, not the disability; to show them not as objects of pity but as ordinary human beings pursuing their simple everyday dreams,” he says. Photographer Vicky Roy collected 100 stories of people living with disabilities to include in the book With its title written in English and braille, the book is part of a 10-year project of the same name, Everyone is Good at Something (EGS), launched in 2021. In February, Roy presented his work at the Jaipur literature festival and has also shown it at the UN in New York and Delhi, with exhibitions in Japan and elsewhere. EGS grew out of a mission by Roy and VR Ferose, founder of the India Inclusion Foundation (IIF), to spread awareness and combat taboos by sharing stories of disability over 10 years and beyond. The IIF aims to “make India inclusive” by 2030, the UN deadline for achieving the sustainable development goals. Stigma around disability in India is reflected by the fact that the census records only about 2% of the population as having disabilities, compared with a world average of about 15%. This suggests families are hiding issues, and many may not know about rights enshrined in India’s 2016 Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, says Ferose. Vicky Roy, right, with VR Ferose, founder of the India Inclusion Foundation “Attitudes have been slowly changing around disability in India,” says Ferose, an engineer based in California, who began working on disability rights after his son was born with autism. “I believe many respond [to the stories] because we’re helping invisible people be seen, especially in rural areas … others want to support them.” Manisha Kumari Mahto, who was born with cerebral palsy, is unable to speak but communicates using sign In Huppu village in eastern Jharkhand, Manisha Kumari Mahto’s parents Mahto and Savita Devi at first believed she could be cured when she was born with cerebral palsy. The little girl is unable to move about or speak, but communicates through signs. “I love listening to songs and I try to dance to them,” she says. Roy has travelled by plane, bus, bike, bullock cart and on foot, even during the pandemic, since he began the project in 2021. It was in remote rural areas that he often received the warmest welcome, he says, and would leave with parcels of food for the journey home. He estimates he has covered about 62,000 miles (100,000km) for EGS. Chhotray Hembram lost his feet as a baby and uses his knees to walk It took him three days to reach Chhotray Hembram, who lives in the tribal region of Ghatkuanri in Bangriposi Tehsil, in the Mayurbhanj district of Odisha. The area had no mobile phone connection and finding an Odia interpreter wasn’t easy. Hembram has walked on his knees for most of his life, after his feet were burned as a baby as he slept next to a cooking fire, while his parents were passed out from drinking alcohol. He had believed “there is nothing much a disabled person can do”. But Roy connected Hembram with a local charity and helped to arrange training to become a mechanic at a garage about 12 miles away. Hembram is now training to become a mechanic, after Roy helped to put him in touch with a local charity On each visit Roy takes a fund of 10,000 rupees (about £92) to spend on something useful to the subject. In the book’s preface, Ferose writes: “We also had a golden rule: when we encounter a person in need, help them lead a life of dignity. So not only did we write the stories but behind the scenes we also supported people, building a roof in a school, donating a laptop, buying a wheelchair or disability vehicle, giving cricket balls and more.” The book relates many encounters with those who have helped expand opportunities in education, sport or work. Satyavati Pandranki was five when she contracted polio in Mentada, in Andhra Pradesh, and says her parents wanted to give her “the best education possible” so that she could lead an independent life, after the disease limited her mobility. Satyavati Pandranki has limited mobility after contracting polio as a child. Her life was transformed after she took up wheelchair basketball in her 20s After completing her degree and teaching qualifications, she was introduced to the Global Aid charity in Vizianagaram, which led her into wheelchair basketball. Since then, she has represented India and trained as a coach. “I was a girl who couldn’t travel from my village to the next one. Now I have played basketball in foreign countries,” she says. Playing basketball has taken Pandranki around the world",Global development; India; Disability; South and central Asia; World news; Books,Global development

It’s time for a reboot | Mo Ibrahim",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/nov/25/global-stability-multilateral-international-development-association-seoul-conflict-climate-crisis-debt-bretton-woods-africa,"Multilateralism is under attack. A toxic brew of multiplying conflicts, worsening climate impact, new pandemics and spiralling debt has brought the system to its knees, appearing almost incapable of properly addressing these converging crises. Adding the unknowns of a Trump administration into the mix will do little to allay concerns. My own critiques of the current multilateral system are well documented, but I do not subscribe to the view that it has no future. What’s needed is a total reboot. By the end of the year, we have a unique opportunity to demonstrate that multilateralism can address these challenges. Next month, the world’s wealthier countries will decide what they can commit in development finance to further support the world’s low-income countries at the World Bank-led International Development Association’s (IDA) 21st “replenishment” in Seoul. These pledges are made only every three years. The decisions made in South Korea will therefore determine how equipped we are to meet the challenges on the horizon. Among countries that have already made pledges ahead of the meeting are Poland and Norway, with a 100% and 50% increase over their previous contributions. Others must now follow suit. The IDA’s track record is strong. In 2024, it committed $31.2bn (£24.3bn) to projects in low-income countries, with more than 70% going to Africa. As a result of IDA commitment between 2012 and 2023, more than 1 billion people received essential health services, 117 million people gained access to improved water services, and 92 million people obtained new or improved electricity services. Since 1960, 35 nations have graduated from IDA, with many, such as India and South Korea – which has announced a 45% increase in its contribution this year – returning as donors, the best proof of success nurtured. This replenishment comes at a critical time, and there may be no second chances. The stakes are unusually high, both for people in low-income countries and for the reputation of the financial multilateral system. The higher-income countries’ decisions come at a tipping point. Implementation of the UN’s sustainable development goals has veered totally off-track for poorer countries, drowning in the very same toxic brew of conflict, climate crisis and post-Covid debt. Let us avoid a blinkered view. Unmet expectations feed frustration and anger, fuelling instability and conflicts. Less development in these countries means more insecurity globally. The ageing Bretton Woods global financial system, to which IDA belongs, is increasingly challenged for its inability to properly address these countries’ specific needs. But this isn’t just about need, it’s also about opportunity. Africa is home to a wealth of key assets. The continent is forecast to have the world’s largest, youngest workforce within just 10 years – provided these young people get the relevant skills. And they will have the entrepreneurial and innovative mindsets needed in this rapidly changing world. Africa also owns major reserves of critical and low-carbon minerals, a huge carbon-sink potential and a wealth of biodiversity, all crucial for the world’s green transition. The IDA can play a pivotal role in turning this potential into reality. Funding health and education remain vital, but access to energy, digital advancement, AI and climate-resilient and sustainable infrastructure and cities will be the gamechangers. Access to energy is a prime example. Without it, there can be no development, no health, no education, no jobs, no sustainable business opportunities. Closing the energy gap for the continent’s 600 million people is essential. I don’t expect the IDA to solve all the challenges. In my foundation’s recent report, Financing Africa: Where is the Money?, we conclude that the funding is often there, but without the relevant mechanisms to use it efficiently. For example, we are still waiting for the mechanisms to ensure that the $650bn of additional special drawing rights (SDRs) pledged after Covid, more than two years ago now, benefit those who need it most. This is an unacceptable waste. Money is an important part of the equation, but not the whole story. In parallel to just replenishing IDA’s resources, we need to seriously work on allocation mechanisms and processes. The world is watching to see whether the already developed countries, and the institutions they established to ensure a peaceful and prosperous world, are equal to the challenges we share today. The stakes are high in a rapidly evolving geopolitical order.

2024-09-16T15:00:03Z,Global cost of failing to invest in women and gender equality is $10tn a year – UN,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/sep/16/un-women-gender-snapshot-2024-equality,"Governments are failing to invest in women and girls and, as a result, are missing out on billions in economic gains, according to a new UN report. This year’s Gender Snapshot report from the UN Women agency found that the global cost of failing to educate young women adequately is an annual $10tn (£7.6tn); low- and middle-income countries will lose $500bn over the next five years if they do not close the gender gap on internet use; and improving support for female farmers could add $1tn to global GDP. It also found that at current rates child marriage could continue until 2092. Papa Seck, head of UN Women’s research and data section, said: “The cost of not achieving gender equality is just way too high but at the same time, the potential returns of doing so are also too high to ignore for societies.” The annual report, which assesses progress of gender equality across the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs), also found that 47.8 million more women than men face moderate or severe food insecurity; that it could take a further 137 years to end extreme poverty for women; and that climate change could force 158 million more women and girls into poverty than men and boys. Governments must “start investing hard cash into women and girls”, said Seck, and make “non-negotiable” changes to their laws to better protect them. No country has all the laws needed to prohibit discrimination, prevent gender-based violence, uphold equal rights in marriage and divorce, guarantee equal pay and provide full access to sexual and reproductive health, the report found. Of the 120 countries where data is available, more than half have at least one restriction preventing women from doing the same jobs as men and half do not classify rape as based on a lack of consent. In the UK, Rachel Saunders, an expert in women’s legal issues at Nottingham University, said the government should create new laws that mandate employers to share staff salaries and allow women to know if there is a sex offender in their area. She said that even when such laws did exist, many were not fully implemented. For example, the Equality Act 2010 is meant to protect UK citizens from workplace discrimination yet Saunders said the gender pay gap persisted and that there was still an expectation for women to take parental leave rather than offering both parents an amount to split. Jemima Olchawski, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for gender equality, said there was a general complacency that viewed gender disparities as “ghosts” from a time when women did not have the rights they had today and an attitude that things would naturally improve over time. “That is absolutely not the case,” she said. “We are consistently and constantly perpetuating and even creating new inequalities for women and girls.” Elsewhere, she said women continued to experience “absolutely horrendous situations”, citing the Taliban’s ban on Afghan women working, studying and even speaking in public. “I’m not at all surprised to see that, sadly,” Olchawski said. “We’re just not seeing progress.” Ezel Buse Sönmezocak, advocacy officer for Women for Women’s Human Rights, a Turkish equality campaign group, suggested that governments should fund feminist moments “because we know that when you [do], you build a defence against backsliding.” The snapshot, she said, should be a signal “to hold on to the SDGs and be more ambitious”.",Global development; Women's rights and gender equality; Sustainable development goals; Gender; Women; Human rights; Child marriage; United Nations; Gender pay gap; Society; Equality Act 2010; Equal pay; World news; Feminism; Equal marriage; Law,Global development
2024-09-22T20:31:33Z,Russia isolated at UN summit after surprise bid to derail pact,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/22/russia-isolated-at-un-summit-after-surprise-bid-to-derail-pact,"Russia was left badly isolated at a high-profile UN summit in New York when it made a surprise move to derail an ambitious pact designed to revive the UN – and failed. Russia’s move to defer adoption of the agreement on the grounds that it supposedly represented western interests was rejected on Sunday by 143 votes to seven with 15 abstentions. The Russian delegation said that if the planned vote endorsing the high-profile “pact for the future” were not deferred pending further talks, it would seek to move an amendment asserting the key issues addressed in the pact are the subject of domestic jurisdiction in which the UN should not seek to intervene. But the overwhelming UN general assembly vote threw out Russia’s call for deferment and its amendment. The Russian move, at the outset of the two-day “summit for the future”, looked diplomatically clumsy, if perhaps designed for domestic consumption. It angered speakers from the African Union (AU) and Mexico, underlining that Moscow had only limited support, notably from Belarus, Nicaragua, Syria and Iran. The AU, led by the Republic of Congo, called for the Russian amendment to be rejected. The pact is seen by many in the global south as both a well-intended and necessary collective effort at UN renewal as well as a personal legacy for a relatively popular UN secretary general António Guterres. But the controversy underlined the extent to which ideological divisions have damaged multilateral cooperation at the UN, the very issue that the pact was seeking to address. Russia objected to 25 provisions in the draft pact, including asserting the primacy of national jurisdiction and rejecting language on universal access to sexual and reproductive health rights, as well as gender empowerment more broadly. With the Russian move crushed, Guterres told the summit that the pact’s aim was “to bring multilateralism back from the brink at a time when the world [is] heading off the rails”. Twenty-first-century challenges – from debt in developing countries to the climate crisis – required 21st-century solutions. Graham Gordon, head of global advocacy at Christian Aid, said of the pact: “The key point of the document, given its inherent limits, is that it does provide pointers of what should be achieved in other forums including the IMF, at Cop and at the G20. The key test will be in 12 months in assessing how much momentum this provides. It is a striking document in its admission of how multilateralism is currently failing.” Guterres had advocated for a Summit for the Future more than two years ago as an attempt to persuade world leaders in the wake of the global Covid outbreak that cooperation and multilateralism had to be revived. The pact, spanning 26 pages and 56 recommendations, says it is offering a new beginning for multilateralism and repeatedly asserts the primacy of international law. But the lack of new specifics has weakened its impact. The document covers reform and expansion of the UN security council to make the body more representative of the 21st century, a UN role in governing artificial intelligence, the phasing out of fossil fuels in energy systems, reform of multilateral financial institutions, a recommitment to full nuclear disarmament and modernising UN peacekeeping so it evolves into war prevention. Concrete ideas include a biennial UN summit on the global economy, an emergency platform for managing pandemics, food insecurity and environmental disasters, and a new UN oversight body of experts advising on the risks posed by AI for all economies. A major sticking point was western opposition to the UN playing a role in making international financial institutions more representative. A UN-led push to include a reference to a $500bn (£375bn) stimulus to put the sustainable development goals back on track was also rejected. • This article was amended on 4 October 2024 to remove Venezuela as one of the countries that had supported the Russian proposals.",United Nations; New York; Russia; African Union; Mexico; António Guterres,World news
2024-10-10T13:32:16Z,"One in eight girls sexually assaulted or raped before turning 18, says Unicef",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/oct/10/one-in-eight-girls-sexually-assaulted-or-raped-before-turning-18-unicef,"More than 370 million women and girls alive today – or almost one in eight – experienced rape or sexual assault before they turned 18, according to the first global estimates of the problem. A new Unicef report describes sexual violence against children as an “overwhelming” human rights violation, with survivors carrying the trauma into adulthood. It says the scale of the violation is “abhorrent in its magnitude”. If “non-contact” forms of sexual violence are included, such as unwanted sexual jokes or comments, exposure to pornography or exposure of sexual organs, the rate rises to one in five, researchers found. The agency said that while girls and women were the worst affected, approximately one boy or man in 11 had also experienced rape or sexual assault during childhood. Unicef’s executive director, Catherine Russell, said: “Sexual violence against children is a stain on our moral conscience. It inflicts deep and lasting trauma, often by someone the child knows and trusts, in places where they should feel safe.” The report includes anonymised stories of individual cases, including 12-year-old Analyn, who was rescued from her home in the Philippines and taken to a government shelter. Aged 10, she had taken part in livestreaming of child sexual abuse after a neighbour approached her and offered money. Xume, a 15-year-old shepherd from a village in Ethiopia, was ostracised by her community after being raped. She said: “The cows were dying because of the drought, but people said it was my fault because I am a bad person. That was because I was raped and didn’t tell anyone out of shame and fear. “But when I turned out to be pregnant, I was excluded from the community and accused of the death of the cows.” Most childhood sexual violence was inflicted on teenagers, with a particular spike between the ages of 14 and 17. The most likely abusers are family, friends or intimate partners. Russell said children in fragile settings, such as those with weak institutions, UN peacekeeping forces, or a large number of refugees, were especially vulnerable. In those areas, one in four girls faced rape or sexual assault. “We are witnessing horrific sexual violence in conflict zones, where rape and gender-based violence are often used as weapons of war,” she said. Sexual violence against children occurred in all regions of the world, the report found. The highest rate was in Oceania, where 34% of women – 6 million people – had been victims. The highest number was in sub-Saharan Africa, where 79 million women and girls, or 22%, were affected. However, Unicef said caution was necessary when comparing between regions, due to factors such as different levels of under-reporting and societal and cultural norms. In 2015, the global community committed to ending all forms of violence against children by 2030 as one of the sustainable development goals. The report comes before an inaugural global ministerial conference on ending violence against children in Colombia in November. Unicef said it had been hard to grasp the scale of sexual violence against children “because of stigma, challenges in measurement, and limited investment in data collection”. This was particularly true when looking at boys’ experiences, and non-contact forms, the UN agency said. But it said that “since the start of the millennium, the widespread boom in access to the internet and use of digital and mobile technology at a global scale has created new forms of sexual abuse and exploitation”. The report is based on surveys conducted between 2010 and 2022 in 120 countries and areas, while estimates for boys and men and of non-contact sexual violence “were informed by a broader range of data sources and applied some indirect methods”. • Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations. In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support on 0808 500 2222 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 in Scotland, or 0800 0246 991 in Northern Ireland. In the US, Rainn offers support on 800-656-4673. In Australia, support is available at 1800Respect (1800 737 732).

2024-11-07T05:01:50Z,Eight countries pledge to ban corporal punishment in ‘fundamental shift’ for children,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/nov/07/countries-pledge-to-ban-corporal-punishment-children,"Eight countries have made new pledges to ban corporal punishment, the most common form of violence against children, in a move that campaigners have labelled “a fundamental shift” for more than 100 million under-18s. The governments of Panama, Kyrgyzstan, Uganda, Burundi, Sri Lanka and the Czech Republic have said they will totally prohibit corporal punishment; while the Gambia and Nigeria have promised to end it in schools. The pledges were made as part of commitments to tackle violence against children ahead of the first global UN ministerial conference on the subject, to be held 7-8 November in Bogotá, Colombia. “It’s amazing,” said Bess Herbert, an advocacy specialist at End Corporal Punishment at the World Health Organization. “[These countries] together account for about 150 million children and it is a fundamental shift for [them]. It’s a very strong signal to the rest of the world that this is the direction we are going in and we just don’t accept violence against children any more.” Corporal punishment includes physical force used to cause some degree of pain or discomfort, however light, as well as non-physical forms of punishment that are cruel and degrading. Currently, 67 states out of 193 have full prohibition of corporal punishment; the first country to ban it was Sweden in 1979. In the UK, Scotland and Wales have banned it, but it is still allowed in home settings in England and Northern Ireland. A growing body of research associates corporal punishment with negative health and behavioural outcomes, including poorer mental health, cognitive development and educational outcomes, increased aggression and antisocial behaviour. It can damage family relationships and, far from teaching children to behave well, teaches them that violence is an acceptable way to resolve conflict, say critics. In some of the worst cases, children are killed. Last month, a boy died in Nigeria after being flogged by his teacher. In England, 10-year-old Sara Sharif was burned with an iron, bitten and had a plastic bag taped over head before she was found dead at her family home in August last year. Dr Etienne Krug, director of the department for social determinants of health at the WHO, said: “Corporal punishment is something from another time. We want to see it banned in all countries. We know it is not an effective way of disciplining children. It is harmful to their health and to their achievements at school.” The first UN conference on violence against children will see more than 130 governments, 90 ministers, survivors, practitioners, youth activists, civil society organisations and funders gather in Bogotá. Other commitments made by governments include a pledge by Solomon Islands to raise the age of marriage from 15 to 18 and one by Fiji to raise the minimum age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 14. Jordan will create a national action plan on violence against children for 2025-2030; the Gambia will pass a Children’s Act and Tanzania has pledged to introduce child protection groups in 25,000 schools. Spain is to establish a new law to tackle safety online, and Colombia, Estonia and the Gambia have also made commitments on this issue. The pledges to end corporal punishment come at a time when one billion young people around the world are victims of cruel acts of violence each year, equating to one in every two children. Violence can take many forms, including corporal punishment, online bullying and abuse, bullying at school, and sexual abuse by clergy, sports leaders, authorities and family members. Violence against children has not received enough attention or funds, claim campaigners, survivors and youth activists. Target 16.2 of the UN sustainable development goals aims to eliminate all forms of violence against children by 2030. “We are of course very far from achieving that,” said Krug. “We still see violence happening every day all over the world. Having said that, there is progress, we know what needs to be done … but it’s just not going fast enough.” Bryanna Mariñas, 22, a youth activist from the Philippines and a member of the first global youth movement to end violence against children, said: “[This conference] has been a long time coming.” Children, youth and survivors of violence had not been given enough opportunities to shape action and policies, she added. “Spaces for children and youth involved in ending violence against children have been tokenistic and are still sorely lacking,” she said. “If we want to change, we have to start with the youth.” Daniela Ligiero, founder of the Brave Movement, a survivor-centred global movement, said: “It’s about making sure people with lived experience are part of the decision-making and the development and implementation of policies. We’ve seen that the combination of data, science, evidence and research with lived experience is incredibly powerful to ensure that policies are fit for purpose and that they are actually effective when implemented.”",Global development; Corporal punishment; Children's rights; Children; World news; Society; United Nations,Global development
2024-09-04T06:00:32Z,Gender equality stalling or going backwards for 1bn women and girls,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/sep/04/gender-equality-stalling-or-going-backwards-for-1bn-women-and-girls,"More than 850 million women and girls are living in countries rated as “very poor” for gender equality, says a new report, subjecting them to a litany of potential restrictions and abuses, including forced pregnancies, childhood marriage and bans from secondary education. The SDG Gender Index, published today by Equal Measures 2030, a coalition of NGOs, found that no country has, so far, achieved the promise of gender equality envisioned by the UN’s 2030 sustainable development goals (SDGs). Between 2019 and 2022, nearly 40% of countries – home to more than 1 billion women and girls – stagnated or declined on gender equality. The SDG index, which benchmarks gender equality across 139 countries, gave 45 countries – including large parts of west, central and sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and countries in Asia including Bangladesh and Myanmar – its worst rating of “very poor”. In addition to the 857 million women and girls living in countries rated “very poor”, 1.5 billion lived in countries rated “poor”. Only one country, Switzerland, was rated “very good”. The report said the “dismal scenario” means global gender inequality could be worse in 2030 than when the goals were set in 2015, as armed conflict, accelerating climate breakdown, anti-gender campaigns and threats to democracy stall or reverse progress. If current trends continue, equality will not be achieved until the 22nd century. “From the explosion of domestic violence during the pandemic to the Taliban getting back into power in Afghanistan, from the brutal repression of the Woman, Life, Freedom movement in Iran and the repeal of Roe v Wade in the US, women’s rights are being eroded,” said Chiara Capraro, the programme director for gender justice at Amnesty International UK. Almost every country in the world agreed to targets to achieve gender equality by 2030 as part of the UN’s SDG initiative. Yet in the past few years there has been a widespread failure concerning progress on women’s rights, which have declined in a number of countries including Poland, the US and Afghanistan. Both Poland and the US have taken regressive steps on abortion rights. In the US 14 states have enacted near-total abortion bans. Under the Taliban, women and girls in Afghanistan have undergone what human rights groups are calling a “gender apartheid”, banning them from secondary school, many forms of paid employment and even speaking or showing their faces outside their homes. Some of the regression in countries such as Sudan, Myanmar and Ukraine can be blamed on recent outbreaks of violence. The report said 614 million women and girls were living in conflict-affected countries in 2022 – 50% higher than the number in 2017. Heather Barr, an associate director of the women’s rights division at Human Rights Watch, said: “We have seen a number of conflicts which have had a devastating impact on women and girls and set back progress in those countries. We can see that with the horrific reports of sexual violence in Sudan, the rise in domestic violence in Ukraine and restrictions on abortion access.” Barr also pointed to the recent emergence of authoritarian governments taking power in countries “working from a playbook that reverses hard-won gains on women’s rights under the pretext of supporting ‘traditional values’”. Accelerating progress on women’s rights required more women in positions of power, said Barr. “Women’s participation – bringing women into decision-making positions both in national governments and internationally in organisations like the UN – is key,” she said. “This is the best way to ensure that we bring about the real changes needed to achieve gender equality, rather than just talking about it.” The SDG Gender Index precedes the annual UN Women snapshot report, to be published later this month, which is expected to document another year of poor progress.",Women's rights and gender equality; Global development; Gender; Human rights; Human rights; Abortion; Taliban; Women; Afghanistan; World news; Law; Society; United Nations; Sustainable development goals,Global development
2024-10-15T08:00:09Z,The essential ingredient of any vaccination programme? Women | Sania Nishtar and Svenja Schulze,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/oct/15/vaccination-programme-women-world-health-summit-leaders-gender-related-barriers-immunisation-diseases-polio,"When confronting diseases such as polio in Gaza and mpox outbreaks in some African countries, we must remember one of the biggest lessons ever learned in global health: women are essential to a solution. Look at polio – a highly infectious disease caused by the poliovirus, which can result in disability, paralysis or death. In most countries, vaccinators are predominantly women, and yet women may face barriers in delivering vaccine services due to sexual harassment and violence, unsafe working conditions, poor or irregular pay and heavy workload. These factors must all be taken into account when planning and implementing vaccination programmes as, done right, they expand access substantially. In a nutshell: if we want to eradicate polio, we must identify and overcome gender-related barriers. One successful example for such approaches comes from south-east Africa. In February 2022 – two years after the entire African continent had been declared polio free – authorities detected the wild poliovirus in the Malawian capital, Lilongwe. In the following months, health workers in Malawi and four neighbouring countries vaccinated more than 50 million children and stepped up surveillance and community outreach. Within 26 months they had ended the outbreak. This response was so successful because it was designed around the roles, attitudes and beliefs of affected women as well as female caregivers. Health workers overcame gender-related barriers to immunisation by leading vaccination teams consisting equally of men and women. In this way, they could reach the affected communities at markets, schools and health facilities. They could foster dialogue with men and women, ensuring everyone was informed to participate in vaccination campaigns. They also identified disparities in the number of boys and girls receiving vaccines, by studying disaggregated data – and were able to take them into account. Ultimately, this led to improved access to and uptake of vaccines. Today, the continent remains free of the wild poliovirus. By using such gender-transformative concepts, it will be possible to end polio once and for all, even in the last two polio-endemic countries, Pakistan and Afghanistan. In Pakistan, for example, several programmes already include women-centred solutions – but more gender mainstreaming is necessary and more women need to be at the forefront of campaign planning, elevating the role of women and girls in healthcare and immunisation services. Another example is the fight against the human papillomavirus (HPV). The virus causes cervical cancer – a disease that kills more than 350,000 women each year, predominantly in low-income countries with insufficient screening and treatment. To promote vaccination, in many places it is necessary to overcome stereotypes associated with immunisation against the virus, which can be transmitted through sexual contact. Several programmes have been creative in addressing these issues. In east Africa, the women-led NGO Girl Effect engages communities. In Nigeria, the influence of first ladies, the wives of state leaders, has built support for vaccination. Together with easy access, often through schools and colleges, more than 14 million girls in 38 countries were immunised against HPV in 2023, eclipsing the total of the preceding 10 years. From mothers making the choices about the future and health of their families to the underpaid and underappreciated female health workers vaccinating children in challenging and dangerous conditions, women are crucial in achieving the UN’s global health goal, ensuring healthy lives and promoting wellbeing for all. Now, as we look towards 2030 and the ambition of all the UN’s sustainable development goals, leaders must play their part in making gender equality a reality. Women need to be put at the centre of immunisation programmes. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, has a target of vaccinating at least 500 million children between 2026 and 2030, including more than 120 million girls with the HPV vaccine. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) has the ambition of ensuring no child anywhere will ever again be paralysed by poliovirus. Both are committed to tackling the injustice that millions of children have never received a single dose of any vaccine. The not-so-secret strategy to achieving these targets is obvious: put women and girls front and centre. This is why we, both global health and gender champions of the GPEI, call for more women in leadership roles to push crucial gender-transformative actions. This week the World Health Summit is being held in Berlin. We call on the leaders attending to show commitment to the progression of gender equality in global health and to make sure all children, wherever they are, have equal access to vaccines.

Netanyahu made the claims of a supposedly deliberate weapons delay in a video posted on X in which he implied that Israel’s ability to prevail in the nine-month war with Hamas was being hampered as a result. Speaking to the camera in English, Netanyahu said he had expressed gratitude in a recent meeting with Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, for American support since last October’s attack on Israel by Hamas, which killed about 1,200 and saw another 250 taken hostage. “But I also said something else,” he said. “I said it’s inconceivable that in the past few months the administration has been withholding weapons and ammunitions to Israel – Israel, America’s closest ally, fighting for its life, fighting against Iran and our other common enemies.” Invoking Winston Churchill, Netanyahu continued: “During world war two, Churchill told the United States, ‘Give us the tools, we’ll do the job.’ And I say, give us the tools, and we’ll finish the job a lot faster.” The broadside appeared to blindside US officials. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters: “We genuinely don’t know what he is talking about.” At a later news conference, Blinken said that the only delayed weapons were 2,000lb bombs that Joe Biden had ordered to put under review because of concerns over an Israeli plan for an incursion into Rafah in southern Gaza, where up to 1 million people are sheltering. “That remains under review. But everything else is moving as it normally would,” said Blinken. The Biden administration finally won congressional approval for a $14bn military aid package for Israel in April after it was held up for months by the House of Representatives. A separate $15bn sale of US F15 aircraft is also set to move forward. Biden has pressed forward with aid despite opposition from within his own Democratic party, where progressives have accused Israel of committing genocide in a war that has now killed more than 37,000 Palestinians. Senior administration officials were said to be angry behind the scenes. Axios, citing two unnamed sources, reported that a bilateral meeting scheduled for 20 June had been called off to send Netanyahu a signal. The report said the US envoy to Israel, Amos Hochstein, had delivered the message to the prime minister personally, telling him that his accusation was “inaccurate and out of line”. “This decision makes it clear that there are consequences for pulling such stunts,” Axios quoted one American official as saying. A spokesperson for the White House national security council did not confirm the cancellation but amplified the perplexity over Netanyahu’s video. “We have been working to find a time to schedule the next SDG [sustainable development goals] that accounts for the travel and availability of principals, but have not yet fully finalized the details, so nothing has been cancelled,” the spokesperson, Eduardo Maia Silva, said in an email. “As we said in the briefing yesterday, we have no idea what the prime minister is talking about, but that’s not a reason for rescheduling a meeting.” Netanyahu is scheduled to visit Washington in late July to address a joint session of Congress, in response to an invitation by the House speaker, Mike Johnson, a close ally of Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.",Israel; Joe Biden; Israel-Gaza war; Weapons technology; US foreign policy; US politics; US news; Middle East and north Africa,World news
2023-10-02T11:55:52Z,"Women’s rights held hostage at UN, say former leaders",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/oct/02/womens-rights-held-hostage-at-un-say-former-leaders,"Women’s rights have been “taken hostage” at the UN, and hard-fought gains are being eroded around the world, a group of former UN leaders has warned. The group has called for the urgent implementation of a rule to put a woman at the helm of the general assembly every other year, to combat a growing hostility to gender equality. It comes after the UN secretary general, António Guterres, pointed out at the UN’s 78th general assembly, in New York last month, that it remained an almost all-male event. “Just four women signed our founding document,” he said. “One look around this room shows not enough has changed. ‘We the people’ does not mean ‘we the men’.” GWL Voices – an advocacy group set up by Irina Bokova, a former director general of Unesco, Helen Clark, the former prime minister of New Zealand, and Susana Malcorra, who was a chief of staff to Ban Ki-moon as UN secretary general – is also insistent that the UN must elect its first female secretary general at the next vote in 2026. Of the 78 presidents elected since 1946, four have been women; there has never been a woman UN secretary general. The movement hopes to use the momentum of the session to push for change, arguing that the lack of gender equality at the heart of the organisation is having a chilling effect on progress for women and girls around the world. “Gender at large, and women’s rights in particular, has become a political battle space,” said Malcorra, the president of GWL Voices. “Many of the rights we thought were secure are not and this is not a problem of certain countries, it’s a problem that cuts across the world.” The group’s report on women’s leadership in the multilateral system reveals that since 1945: Women have led 33 of the most important institutions for only 12% of the time Only a third of key multilateral organisations are headed by a woman 13 organisations, including the four largest development banks, have never been led by a woman Only 24% of permanent representatives to the UN are women Malcorra, Clark and Bokova were contenders for the role when Guterres was elected as the ninth male UN secretary general in 2016. At the time there was pressure on states to elect a woman: Equality Now had a campaign, while the UN’s president of the general assembly, Mogens Lykketoft, and president of the security council, Samantha Power, wrote to all member states, asking them to nominate female candidates. Guterres was the only contender when he was re-elected in 2021 for a second term. GWL argues that the presidency of the general assembly – the main policymaking body of the UN, made up of the 193 member states – should adopt “gender alternation”, a move backed by the presidents of Slovenia, Botswana and Spain. “The general assembly has rotated among the five regional country groups each year since 1963,” said Malcorra. “Now the general assembly needs to agree to rotate the gender of its president each year.” While any member state could propose this through a resolution for adoption, achieving it could be challenging, said María Fernanda Espinosa, a GWL Voices member, and one of four female former presidents of the general assembly. “You would think it was common sense and easy to do, but the issue of gender equality and women’s rights has become extremely contentious, and has become also a thing to bargain with,” she said. “This transition to a very clear multipolar world, the war in Ukraine and the sub-regional tensions have created an atmosphere within the UN that is tense. There is a lack of trust between parties, north and south, east and west. Unfortunately, women and girls have been taken hostage by these overall tensions.” Women in the roles of secretary general and general assembly president could help shift the conversation, she added. “It’s an important, substantial change – these things can infuse an atmosphere that is more conducive and more positive.” The need was urgent, said Fernanda Espinosa, pointing to stalled progress on the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs), agreed by UN member states in 2015. At the start of September, UN Women said the world was failing women and girls and stated in a report that it was “way off track” to meet the 2030 deadline for SDG gender targets. “We cannot think of a better future of a world of peace and prosperity and human rights – the very pillars of the UN – without having 50% of the world’s population on board,” said Fernanda Espinosa.",Women's rights and gender equality; United Nations; Global development; World news; António Guterres,Global development
2025-05-11T14:00:24Z,Ikea Valevåg mattress review: a brilliant budget buy or too cheap for comfort?,https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/may/11/ikea-valevag-mattress-review-uk,"My expectations for the Ikea Valevåg were, to be polite, limited. Ikea’s mattress is less than a fifth of the price of a Simba Hybrid Pro – but somehow comes with the same 10-year guarantee. Seriously? Expecting a decade’s worth of blissful sleeps from a Valevåg sounds like an attempt to wear the same £8 Primark jumper every day until 2035. But when I tested the Valevåg alongside several more expensive rivals, I realised it’s not the mattress equivalent of fast-fashion tat. Its price belies a well-constructed product with pocket springs that provide consistent support and snoozable comfort. It can’t compare with the pricey Simba or the best-in-show Otty Original Hybrid for ergonomic cosiness, but it’s a brilliant buy for a guest room or a young person’s bedroom. To make sure, I enlisted the help of my 22-year-old niece, Alex, in testing the Valevåg. Her reluctance to give it to charity after two months of sleeping on it – sorry Alex, them’s the rules at the Filter – reassured me that it’s a genuine bargain and not a false economy destined for landfill. View at Ikea *** How I tested I took delivery of a medium-firm Ikea Valevåg in a double size in December. I shared it with my husband for three nights before delegating responsibilities to Alex, who slept on it for two months. Together with other family members, we rated its firmness and overall comfort side by side against five other mattresses, and I ran lab-style tests to measure factors such as sinkage, edge support and heat retention. You can read more about our mattress testing exploits here. *** What you need to know, from price to firmness View at Ikea The Valevåg is one of seven sprung mattresses made by Ikea. It falls roughly in the middle on price, costing from £149 for a single to £359 for a super king, all available in firm or medium-firm tension. The double size I tested costs £219. The Ikea is the only pocket sprung mattress I’ve tested so far. All the others are hybrid mattresses that contain multiple layers of memory foam and springs. It does have an upper layer of polyurethane foam, which I measured to be 5cm deep, but with a density of 33kg/cu.m, it’s not elastic enough to be classed as memory foam. Instead, it’s “reflex foam” and adds much-needed resistance and support above the springs. It also helps to create a flat sleeping surface beneath the polyester fabric cover, which isn’t removable. Under the foam layer, the Valevåg has 249 steel springs per square metre, adding up to about 640 in a double size. Each spring is wrapped in a fabric pocket to help it move independently and isolate motion – in other words, so the whole thing doesn’t bounce too much when you move around in bed. There’s also a layer of felt below the springs to help maintain the mattress’s structure. At 24cm deep, the Valevåg is the thinnest mattress I’ve tested, and this has a couple of advantages. First, it’s much lighter than the chunky hybrids. Moving it up and down stairs on my own still took effort, but it’s much easier to manoeuvre than its more luxurious counterparts. It’s also perfect for a standard fitted sheet – a relief after I failed to squeeze my sheets on to the likes of the 31cm-thick Origin Hybrid Pro. Ikea’s mattress would be relatively easy to flip over, but you don’t have to. The Valevåg has a distinct top (sleeping) side and bottom side, more like a hybrid than a conventional sprung mattress. Instead of flipping, rotate it 180 degrees every few months to prevent indentations where you sleep. Ikea’s description of the Valevåg as “medium-firm” is spot on. My family scored it an average 6.8/10 for firmness, similar to the Simba Hybrid Pro. In my lab tests, the Valevåg sank a maximum of 34mm under 7.5kg of weight – closer to the softest mattress I’ve tested (the Eve Wunderflip Hybrid, which sank 40mm) than the firmest (the Origin Hybrid Pro, a mere 18mm). Both these mattresses are advertised as medium-firm, too. You can test the Valevåg’s firmness at Ikea, but bear in mind that many other shoppers may have had a go before you, with a softening effect over time. If you’d rather test your own new version, Ikea gives you a 365-night free trial. Keep it in good condition with a mattress protector if you hope to avail yourself of the refund offer. *** Specifications Type: pocket sprung Firmness: advertised as medium firm, panel rated as 6.8/10 Depth: 24cm Cover: not removable Turn or rotate: not needed Trial period: 365 nights Warranty: 10 years Old mattress recycling: £40 via the Mattress Recycling People Sustainability credentials: 2025 target of 20% recycled content in all Ikea mattress foams *** Delivery and packaging I expected my Valevåg to arrive fully expanded and ready for napping on, but Ikea has adopted the vacuum-roll packing style initiated by online “bed-in-a-box” companies such as Otty. This means it’s machine-compressed in the factory, then wrapped tightly in metres of plastic to stop it from expanding en route to your door. My mattress was delivered by Ikea’s own team, a nice change from the third-party couriers that handled my other test samples. Delivery took only three days, and Ikea kept me informed with text alerts, a four-hour window and a link to track the driver on a map. Unwrapping the Valevåg was marginally easier than the other roll-wrapped mattresses because there was no cardboard box, but the thick layers of plastic were, as ever, a pain to remove. Scissors are essential, as is a careful hand to prevent damage to the mattress. The mattress emerged from its wrapping looking quite flat, but it took much less time than its hybrid rivals to expand to full size. Ikea recommends you allow 72 hours for your mattress to fill out, but mine rose to the occasion within a day and a half, and its relative shortage of foam content meant that any “off-gassing” chemical smell was reassuringly brief. *** What we love View at Ikea There’s plenty to love about the Valevåg: value for money, easy manoeuvrability, plump supportiveness and unpretentious composition (does a mattress really need eight layers of variously dense memory foam, infused with graphite and bamboo?). The key to a successful mattress, though, is good sleep – and my sleep tester had few complaints here. I spent a few nights on the Valevåg before handing over to my niece, Alex. I was used to sleeping on the Simba Hybrid Pro and then the Otty Original Hybrid, both superb high-end mattresses, so I was spoiled. It took me longer to get to sleep on the Ikea, and my husband and I were more aware of our movements. However, it offered consistent support and a degree of comfort that belied its price. Alex was even more impressed. You might expect a 22-year-old drama student to be unfussy about mattress quality, but during our initial family mattress-rating session, Alex worried that the Valevåg wouldn’t be firm enough for her. Once the sleeping began, however, she liked its overall body support, which was balanced by enough “give” for her hips and shoulders when lying on her side. She also praised the reflex foam layer, which made her feel “lifted up, not sinking in the middle” – and bounced back when pressed. Mattresses containing a lot of memory foam can soften significantly in their first year or so, but this is unlikely to happen with the pocket sprung Valevåg. The breathability of the surface and pocket springs proved a hit. Alex had voiced her dislike of the “moist spongy” feel of foamy mattresses, such as the Eve Wunderflip Hybrid, but found the Ikea “more naturally bed-like”, and this helped her sleep well on it from the first night. In my heat-retention tests, it cooled down faster than any mattress other than the pricier Panda Hybrid Bamboo, which is specifically designed to stay cool. The Valevåg would be a great choice if you experience night sweats or struggle to sleep on warm nights. Two months is not enough to judge a mattress’s durability, but we had our ways. We walked all over the Valevåg to see if the springs would give way (don’t try this at home – it invalidates many warranties), but it remained robust and supportive, with no twangs. There was no sagging in the sleeping surface after two months. *** What we don’t love When I slept on the Valevåg, I could feel the difference between it and the more expensive hybrids. It’s firm enough, but it doesn’t offer much ergonomic pushback. The combination of memory foam and springs in the Otty and Simba makes you feel powerfully supported in all the right places, and that’s worth paying for if you need to improve your sleep quality and reduce aches and pains. Alex had no trouble sleeping on the Valevåg, but she does enjoy reading in bed for hours on end, and it didn’t fully support the concentrated weight of her bottom when sitting up. Edge support is shaky, too. It doesn’t completely give way when you sit on the side, but it would benefit from high-density foam around its perimeter. Another weak spot is motion isolation, so it wouldn’t be a relaxing choice if you share your bed with a restless partner. The fabric cover isn’t removable for washing in the machine, which is a pity because it gets dirty easily. My cat Iggy sees test mattresses as giant scratching posts, and the Valevåg’s claw marks are more visible than any others. Our walking on the Valevåg didn’t seem to do much damage, but the easy wear and tear of the outside makes me wonder how robust the inside is. *** Sustainability Compressing mattresses for delivery means they use less space in the warehouse and van. With more than 12m mattresses sold by Ikea every year, the resulting decrease in transport emissions must be significant. However, I wouldn’t call it a sustainability win. The amount of plastic involved is enormous and doesn’t feel justified, although that’s true for all the mattresses I’ve tested. Doorstep recycling services generally don’t collect soft plastic, so we had to take it to the local refuse and recycling centre to dispose of ours responsibly. Having to do this for every mattress I tested was a chore, but most customers will only have to deal with the plastic from one mattress at a time. The Valevåg’s steel springs, polypropylene pockets and polyester fabric are widely recycled, although again, you’d have to get them to a suitable recycling hub. The non-biodegradable polyurethane “reflex foam” layer is more environmentally challenging. As with most mattress-makers, Ikea will collect and recycle your old mattress (whether or not it’s an Ikea), and its £40 charge is fairly typical. I was impressed by the extent of information Ikea publishes about this process, including how each component is recycled or repurposed. Mattress recycling is just one of the services Ikea offers as part of its green goals, which are set in line with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. Others include using zero-emissions vehicles for more than 90% of home deliveries by 2028, electrical recycling, and a platform for reselling your preloved Ikea furniture – although mattresses are excluded from this. *** Ikea Valevåg: should I buy it? The Valevåg is unarguably a brilliant buy. Its 10-year guarantee and 365-day free trial show that Ikea has confidence in its durability, although we’d recommend using a protective cover or three. This is no ergonomic, orthopaedic wonder mattress, but at a squeak over £200, it provides more than your money’s worth of support, comfort and good sleep.

2024-06-28T07:00:15Z,Campaign to decriminalise suicide in four Caribbean nations gains momentum,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jun/28/decriminalise-suicide-caribbean-nations-campaign-acc,"Pressure to decriminalise suicide in four Caribbean nations is mounting as a new coalition has come together for the first time to fight for the repeal of colonial-era laws. A group of people with experience of poor mental health, government officials, activists, legal experts and healthcare workers, led by organisations in the Caribbean, will advocate for legislative reform. They want to reduce barriers for people seeking help and ensure that mental health services can operate without fear of legal repercussions and ultimately save lives. Suicide is illegal in St Lucia, Grenada, the Bahamas and Trinidad and Tobago, and attempted suicide is punishable by up to two years in prison or a fine. The laws were introduced by the British during colonial rule. Suicide was decriminalised in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in the 1960s – it has never been a crime under Scottish law. Although the laws are rarely enforced in the Caribbean and many people don’t know they exist, there have been reports of arrests. The laws continue to be used to threaten people, according to coalition member Desarie Nicholas, a social worker and the founder of Caricope Wellness Alliance, an organisation that offers mental health support to Caribbean people. “I had a client who was getting out of psychiatric hospital after a suicide attempt and she was told, ‘You have to keep checking in with us every month because if you don’t, you know we can send you to jail’,” said Nicholas. “How does that help them feel nurtured and safe and willing to really be honest about how they feel? This law informs everything we do and the way we think about things.” Around the world, there are 25 countries where attempted suicide remains a crime and 27 where the status of legal frameworks remains unclear, according to Decriminalise Suicide Worldwide, a global campaign by Lifeline International. The move to repeal laws in the Caribbean comes at a time when several countries, including Guyana, Pakistan, Ghana and Malaysia, have got rid of similar colonial-era laws criminalising suicide. It follows the Bridgetown Declaration, adopted at the Small Island Developing States ministerial conference on non-communicable diseases and mental health last year, where members committed to decriminalise suicide. Dr Timothy Morgan, director of the mental health unit at the Ministry of Health in Guyana, where in 2022 the suicide prevention bill repealed the law that made suicide a criminal offence and replaced it with a national suicide prevention plan, said: “Even though it is uncommon for those attempting suicide to be charged or imprisoned in Guyana, the previous law only added another layer of legal complexity to those experiencing emotional distress from contemplating suicide and needing mental healthcare.” More than 700,000 people globally die by suicide every year, about three-quarters (77%) in low- and middle-income countries. It is the fourth leading cause of death among 15- to 29-year-olds. Reducing the global suicide mortality rate by a third by 2030 is a target of the UN sustainable development goals and the World Health Organization, which says laws that make suicide and suicide attempts illegal remain an impediment to meeting this goal. The WHO has released a guide on decriminalising suicide for policymakers, with explanations of how countries have managed it. International helplines can be found at www.befrienders.org. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

2024-07-22T08:00:28Z,Most new HIV infections occurred outside sub-Saharan Africa for first time – UN report,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jul/22/most-new-hiv-infections-occurred-outside-sub-saharan-africa-for-first-time-un-report,"The majority of new HIV infections last year occurred in countries outside sub-Saharan Africa for the first time. African countries have made swift progress in tackling the virus, with the number of infections in sub-Saharan Africa 56% lower than in 2010, a new report from UNAids said. Globally, infections have fallen by 39% over the same period. “For the first time in the history of the HIV pandemic, more new infections are occurring outside sub-Saharan Africa than in sub-Saharan Africa. This reflects both the prevention achievements in much of sub-Saharan Africa and the lack of comparable progress in the rest of the world,” said the report, which found case numbers were rising in eastern Europe and central Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and north Africa. UNAids said the world is “at a crossroads” in efforts to tackle the virus, with action this year key to success. A backlash against human rights in many countries is making it harder for marginalised groups to access care, said Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAids. At the same time, services face funding shortfalls after cuts in aid, and with many low-income countries “choking on debt”, that reduces domestic health spending, she said. There is also a risk that gamechanging new drugs that need only to be taken every few months to treat or prevent HIV will only be available in richer countries. Almost 10 years ago, global leaders agreed to end Aids as a public health threat by 2030 in the UN sustainable development goals. “The world is not on track to succeed,” said Byanyima. “The world can end Aids by 2030 but that will depend on the actions of leaders, both government and corporate leaders, the actions they take today.” In 2023, 39.9 million people across the world were living with HIV, according to a new report from UNAids launched on Monday at the 25th international Aids conference in Munich, Germany. There were 1.3 million new HIV infections and 630,000 Aids-related deaths, including 76,000 children. Dr Sharon Lewin, president of the International Aids Society, said the data showed that countries that commit to managing their epidemics “even in the poorest parts of the world, can indeed lower HIV infections”. “That is very exciting and inspiring,” she said. “The flipside of that, is that the infections outside sub-Saharan Africa might be more challenging to get on top of.” Lewin said infections were focused in marginalised groups, including people who inject drugs, sex workers, transgender women or gay men, who faced discriminatory and punitive laws. “This is not a biomedical issue. It’s a societal issue and that’s a bigger challenge.” Byanyima said it was vital to “protect the human rights of everybody”, citing evidence that rates of HIV among gay men are lower where homosexuality is decriminalised. With new criminalisation laws, such as in Uganda, “we have to work hard to keep the progress”, she said. “This backlash on rights, this backlash against democracy, against the rights of women, against LGBTQ rights, is pushing people away from the services that they have a right to. “We need to have further progress on decriminalisation, particularly in Africa, and we need to fight stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV and people at risk.” Young women in sub-Saharan Africa remain particularly vulnerable, Byanyima said. She called for policies to reduce the inequalities they face, including universal and free secondary education. In eastern Europe and central Asia, and the Middle East and north Africa, just 50% of people living with HIV are taking antiretroviral drugs that suppress the virus and reduce the risk of passing it on. Sub-Saharan Africa remains home to almost half of people living with HIV who have no treatment. Access is especially low among children, the report warned. Byanyima said it was urgent that “gamechanging technology” such as long-acting drugs to treat or prevent HIV, already available in places such as the US, be shared immediately with developing countries. “If it’s going to take another six years, 10 years, before prices come down for those countries, then we won’t end Aids,” she said. “But if we can move quickly to put that technology in the medicines patent pool and have generics making it in a few years time, we could get there.” She also called for “a solution to the debt crisis, a restructuring of debt to free up resources, but also boosting aid”. The report said resources were at their lowest level in more than a decade.",Global development; Aids and HIV; Global health; Society; World news; Africa; Aid; United Nations,Global development
2025-03-03T08:00:40Z,‘We had all this energy’: the landmark gathering of women that unnerved the Chinese government,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/mar/03/we-had-all-this-energy-the-landmark-gathering-of-women-that-unnerved-the-chinese-government,"In September 1995, tens of thousands of women from around the world gathered in a sleepy town nearly 40 miles (60km) north of Beijing. The original plan had been to meet in the capital but, unnerved by such a large number of women, the Chinese authorities had insisted they stay a safe distance from the city in the settlement of Huairou, much of which was still under construction. The government’s distrust ran deep: hotels were provided with extra blankets in case the women decided to stage an impromptu naked protest; movement between Beijing and Huairou was strictly controlled; and the unseasonal rain was blamed on a concentration of women menstruating. But neither the weather nor the slights could dampen spirits at what proved to be an extraordinary event: the NGO Forum on Women. Running parallel to the UN’s Fourth World Conference on Women at the Beijing International Convention Centre, the forum welcomed 30,000 feminist leaders, rights advocates, Indigenous activists, NGO representatives and academics from 180 countries. It was the largest international gathering of women the world had ever seen, and a seminal moment in the women’s rights movement. “Beijing was the culmination [of years of work]. As [feminist writer] bell hooks put it, we had been trying to move from the margins to the centre – and that’s what was so exciting,” says Charlotte Bunch, founding director of the Center for Women’s Global Leadership at Rutgers University in the US. Participants tramped through mud in the half-built town to attend networking and strategy events in tents; they got soaked riding open-top tourist buses to the official UN conference in Bejing. But it all heightened the sense of camaraderie. Over 11 days, issues such as affirming women’s rights as human rights; violence against women; reproductive rights; and the welfare of the girl child were discussed and debated. The result was the landmark Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action – a document covering 12 critical areas that, 30 years on, remains the historic blueprint for gender equality. “It was amazing – women of every colour and age and disability and race all fighting for equality and doing things in a very organised and coordinated way. We had an advocacy strategy and all this energy that felt powerful – and we really managed to influence the agenda,” says Ana Cristina González, who was a 27-year-old newly qualified doctor specialising in reproductive health when she went to China as part of the Latin American delegation. “It made me feel [that] what I dreamed was possible. That meeting marked my entire career and my feminism,” she adds. The sense that Beijing was transformative, personally and politically, is echoed by countless women, many of whom went on to become leaders in the women’s movement. “The atmosphere was incredible. I’d never sat with someone from Tibet or the Middle East – there was excitement and a feeling that we could achieve a lot,” says Lydia Alpízar Durán, co-executive director of IM-Defensoras, a Latin American network of female defenders. “We got a lot done in Beijing. Beyond the government agreement we built a global women’s movement. Beijing catalysed so many processes.” It was far from easy. Months of preparation went into national and regional strategies to ensure the agenda reflected grassroot demands; debates were fierce and lengthy. The text of the declaration was pored over, word by word, until there was agreement. The Chinese authorities didn’t tolerate public protest but when women thought they were being ignored they found ways to show their disapproval – at one point the Latin American delegation blocked the escalators at the conference centre. Indian feminist Gita Sen, founder of Developing Alternatives with Women for a New Era (Dawn), says: “One of the big moments was when the [then] president of the World Bank, James Wolfensohn, came in. “Wolfensohn was viewed as more liberal [than previous presidents]; his wife was considered a feminist. I think he thought he would get congratulated but he got a shellacking – people screamed at him: ‘Do you know what you have done to our lives? You and the IMF are destroying us.’ I think he was genuinely shocked, but he went back and tried to soften some of the [bank’s] policies.” When Hillary Clinton, wife of the then US president Bill Clinton, made her speech in Beijing declaring “women’s rights as human rights, once and for all”, the world listened – but the credit goes to the thousands of women who had worked tirelessly in the years before in their own countries and at key UN conferences, including Vienna in 1993 and Cairo in 1994. “Up until 1980 women’s events were on the sidelines – they were not viewed at the core of anything the UN was doing. And today we are in the backlash against all those things that we were moving forward,” says Bunch. Bunch was one of a group of women who came up with the 16 days of activism campaign in 1991. Also among them was Everjoice Win, a Zimbabwean who had been working in women’s rights since 1989. Both women went to Beijing. “I have often described the early 1990s as the golden era of transnational organising: there were these spaces – Mexico, Cairo, Vienna, Beijing – some of us went to all four [UN conferences]. But it wasn’t just going, but having an agenda collectively to influence the advancement of women’s rights. Everyone had purpose and objectives,” says Win. The 12-point plan galvanised governments and civil society and, in 2015, informed the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs). “Governments took to the [Beijing] agenda like ducks to water – with limitations. Gender mainstreaming became the approach of choice for governments,” adds Win, who went on to become the first head of women’s rights at Action Aid in 2002. “We put women’s rights centre of Action Aid’s agenda using some of the tools we’d got from the Beijing process. Once they understood what gender mainstreaming was we were able to influence the leadership of the organisation, making sure women were in senior roles.” Next week in New York, the UN’s commission on the status of women (CSW) will mark the 30th anniversary of the Beijing declaration. UN secretary general António Guterres will open the meeting on Monday with a declaration on the global state of gender equality. The statement will be based on a progress report, informed by updates from 159 governments and acknowledges improvements. Today, 122.4 million girls are out of school, down from 124.7 million in 2015. Maternal mortality has declined from 339 to 223 deaths in every 100,000 live births between 2000 and 2020. Since 1995, the proportion of women in parliaments has more than doubled from 11% to 27%. Countries have also steadily continued to remove discriminatory laws. Such stocktakes on gender equality are made every five years, but this year the sense of urgency is greater, because, despite improvements in some areas, “cascading crises” including the climate disaster, economic shocks, rising conflict and declining democracy mean the vision of the Platform for Action – and the 2030 SDGs – remains a distant dream. In this unstable environment, anti-women sentiment and action has thrived, turbocharged by authoritarian governments and social media. “Growing backlash has been reinforced by the hollowing out of policy mechanisms, institutions and processes that the [Beijing] Platform for Action tasked with advancing gender equality,” the report says. The fact that the rightwing, anti-abortion Center for Family and Human Rights (C-Fam) is holding its own two-day conference in parallel with CSW at a venue opposite the UN headquarters, is evidence of a more strategic, better funded, smarter anti-rights movement. Like many anti-feminist organisations, it has co-opted the language of women’s development with its assertions that it is “empowering women” – while welcoming President Donald Trump’s shutdown of USAid which will have devastating effects on women and girls. “In my view, we are experiencing an epochal transformation,” says Brazilian academic Sonia Corrêa, co-chair of Sexuality Policy Watch. “There are no easy solutions. The state of the world is a very difficult problem, the conditions are being determined by neo-fascist forces in power in what is still one of the empires of the world.” It could mean there is no intergovernmental agreement at CSW this year if the US blocks, Corrêa believes. “I don’t need to elaborate how deeply the ultra right hate the UN.” “It’s a worrying moment,” agrees Win. “The question is: are others going to mimic the orange tyrant – I refuse to use his name – by doing what he does or [are they going to] counter him?” But if the contemporary political landscape is very different from the 1990s “golden era” of trust in democracy, multilateralism and institutions, the lessons learned from Beijing are still relevant, say the women who were there. “We can’t forget we were the people who pushed back an unequal world – we were pushing back and transforming. We spent years explaining and showing the world there were inequalities and that we wanted to be better. We are fighting for democracies, so we can not think only ‘how are we going to react?’ but ‘what are we going to continue doing?’” says González, who now heads Causa Justa, the group that spearheaded the campaign to decriminalise abortion in Colombia – a fight it won in 2022. There is some comfort, they say, in stepping back from the chaos and taking a longer view. Bunch says, “I grew up in the 50s and became part of the 60s’ explosion; yes, it is scary now, the power that Trump has but there are ups and downs and we are in a down period. People fighting McCarthyism had faith there would come another time. I don’t want to dampen the energy of the outrage – but in the down period you have to be preparing to move forward where you can. This is our moment, and we have to do the best we can.” Or as Win puts it: “Change is going to come. But we remind ourselves that change is not microwaveable – change has to be baked or roasted – microwaving ain’t going to do it.”",Global development; Women's rights and gender equality; Women; Society; United Nations; World news; Feminism,Global development
2024-06-06T16:57:14Z,Voters must demand that all candidates and parties commit to radical action on the climate crisis | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/06/voters-must-demand-that-all-candidates-and-parties-commit-to-radical-action-on-the-climate-crisis,"David King’s passionate advocacy is a timely reminder in the run-up to the UK and European elections of the imperative to persuade, or force, governments, markets and corporations to immediately prioritise “reducing emissions, removing excess greenhouse gases (GHGs) … repairing ecosystems; and strengthening local and global resilience” (Humanity’s survival is still within our grasp – just. But only if we take these radical steps, 27 May). To make this happen, while raising the huge amounts of money needed for the transition and enabling disadvantaged nations and communities, voters should demand that all candidates and parties commit to the following: 1) Make global agreements to keep planetary heating well below 2C, and to protect 30% of the planet for nature by 2030, statutory obligations. They are critical for delivering the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs). 2) Ramp up taxes on carbon/GHG emissions, financial transactions, ecosystem-destroying operations (and the goods produced thereby), plastics and resource waste. This will further restrain the corporations profiting from the climate-nature crisis. 3) Use these revenues solely as subsidies and grants for local government, households (especially low-income) and small and medium-sized enterprises to invest in energy efficiency, renewables and resource conservation. Globally, a transaction tax of just 0.5% would raise hundreds of billions of dollars for funding the SDGs, climate reparations, and critical nature conservation and restoration programmes, and be primarily paid by the wealthiest top 10%. 4) Switch subsidies for climate-nature-destroying industries to low-zero energy and fuels, regenerative agriculture and forestry, and the circular economy to reduce resource waste and minimise land and seafloor mining. The International Energy Agency calculated that direct global subsidies for coal, gas and oil alone exceeded $1tn in 2022. 5) Use national and local government procurement budgets to support climate-nature positive businesses. Finally, after the election, transform the energy of protest marches and petitions into continuous constituency pressure on ministers and MPs to deliver. Charles Secrett Brighton, East Sussex • Well done for publishing yet another massive kick in the backside of world governments from David King, chair of the global Climate Crisis Advisory Group. King’s radical prescription of 4 Rs – reduce emissions, build resilience, repair ecosystems, remove greenhouse gases – might seem unachievable. Politicians around the globe continue to succumb to the profit-focused siren song of the fossil-fuel industry, granting them ever more gas and oil drilling and refining licences, instead of paying attention to the views of their citizens, the great majority of whom want to protect the climate and nature. The reason for this is clear, as you acknowledge in your recent editorial (The Guardian view on the climate emergency: we cannot afford to despair, 8 May): “It is true that what citizens support in theory and what they actually vote for do not always align. Tackling global heating will be cheaper than trying to live with it, but the costs are upfront and the rewards long term – certainly longer than electoral cycles.” So why do we, at UK climate charity Carbon Copy, remain stubborn climate optimists? Because it was never going to be about incremental change. Like the Earth’s natural systems that we are driving towards cascading environmental collapse, as the Guardian columnist George Monbiot has said (After the failure of Cop26, there’s only one last hope for our survival, 4 November 2021), it will only take about 25% of the public to change their behaviour to create a comparable massive cultural shift. “Our last, best hope,” wrote Monbiot, “is to use those dynamics to our advantage, triggering what scientists call ‘cascading regime shifts’.” And it is we, citizens working together in countries around the world, who are still making progress towards that cultural tipping point.

2024-05-13T12:23:33Z,"Global wildlife crime causing ‘untold harm’, UN report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/13/global-wildlife-crime-untold-harm-un-report-unodc-aoe,"More than 4,000 species around the world are being targeted by wildlife traffickers, causing “untold harm upon nature”, a UN report has warned. Wildlife crime is driven by demand for medicine, pets, bushmeat, ornamental plants and trophies. Out of all the mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians seized, 40% were on the red list of threatened or near-threatened species, the report found. The trade is active in more than 80% of countries, with seizures representing a small fraction of overall crime, according to the report from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). It states: “Despite gaps in knowledge about the full extent of wildlife trafficking and associated crime, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that this remains a significant global problem far from being resolved.” Researchers looked at more than 140,000 wildlife seizures that took place between 2015 and 2021. They examined the impacts, trends and drivers of the trade. Corals, large reptiles such as crocodiles and elephants were involved in the largest number of individual seizures. Wildlife crime appears to have been a driving factor in local and global extinctions of species such as rare orchids, succulent plants, reptiles and fish, the report says, and yet some species that are the worst-affected receive little public attention. Body parts or bones of animals such as pangolins, seahorses and big cats are often dried and used in medicine. Parrots and iguanas are sought after as pets, and orchids as ornamental plants. About 16,000 tonnes of goods were seized. “Actual wildlife trafficking levels are of course far greater than the recorded seizures,” researchers say in the report. “Wildlife crime inflicts untold harm upon nature, and it also jeopardises livelihoods, public health, good governance and our planet’s ability to fight climate change,” said Ghada Waly, the executive director of the UNODC. Previous research has found that certain populations of spider monkeys and Baird’s tapir have declined by 99.9% owing to the illegal wildlife trade. Local disappearances could lead to global extinctions, researchers warn. Much wildlife crime is linked to large organised crime groups. Corruption plays a critical role in undermining efforts to stop wildlife trafficking, from bribes paid to inspectors, to government officials allowing fake permits, the report says. Seizures were made in 162 countries. The report states: “An absence of seizures of a particular commodity or at a certain location could reflect lack of enforcement, rather than evidence that illegal trade was not taking place.” The number of seizures has been increasing over the past two decades, but declined in 2020 and 2021, possibly due to a range of factors, including the Covid-19 pandemic, less enforcement, a genuine reduction in trafficking, or shifts in the way the illegal trade was happening (such as moving to digital platforms) that made it harder to detect. Some estimates suggest the illegal wildlife trade could be worth as much as $23bn (£18bn) a year, with more than 100 million plants and animals trafficked annually. A study published in 2019 found 24% of the world’s known land-based vertebrates were included in the wildlife trade. The UNODC aims to end trafficking of protected species as part of the UN sustainable development goals. The data examined gives “no reason for confidence” that this target will be met by 2030, the report says. Better enforcement is needed to tackle supply and demand, as well as better implementation of existing legislation, and more monitoring and research, the report says. Waly said: “To address this crime, we must match the adaptability and agility of the illegal wildlife trade.”",Illegal wildlife trade; Wildlife; Environment; Conservation; Biodiversity; Extinct wildlife; World news,Environment
2023-11-18T00:01:05Z,David Cameron ‘wants to unlock billions of dollars for foreign aid’,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/nov/18/david-cameron-wants-to-unlock-billions-of-dollars-for-foreign-aid,"David Cameron is marking his return to frontline politics by saying he wants to unlock billions of dollars for foreign aid over the next decade, as part of a “moral mission” to help the world’s poorest people. In a remarkable change of tone for a government that closed the Department for International Development and slashed the foreign aid budget, the former prime minister is to say he wants to push for the restoration of aid’s status in British foreign policy. Cameron, who was appointed foreign secretary by Rishi Sunak on Monday in an astonishing political comeback, is to write in a foreword to a new international development white paper that foreign aid is even more vital, but more difficult than when he was last in office. The internationalist tone will probably infuriate the Tory right, already angry that Cameron’s return signals a rush to the political centre ground, while his failure to formally commit extra public money to aid will dismay many charities. Cameron will say that the UK must find fresh ways to meet the UN’s sustainable development goals, including ending global hunger by 2030. He describes the UN goals as a remarkable achievement, adding “crucially, we made these promises to every country and person on the planet – nobody would be left behind”. The development white paper is to be published on Monday as a global food summit is held in London. Officials say Cameron took the draft white paper home in his ministerial box on his first day in office, reading it overnight. In office Cameron made aid a central component of “compassionate Conservatism”, committing his government to spending 0.7% of GDP on aid, and co-chairing a UN panel on extreme poverty that led in 2015 to the 17 UN sustainable development goals. The white paper focuses on new policy approaches and ways of leveraging extra state and private funds for aid, which Cameron says could “unlock hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade”. It does not change the economic preconditions set by Sunak for a return to spending 0.7% of GDP, after the aid budget was cut to 0.5% in 2020. The foreign secretary will say the UK needs to move away from the old donor-recipient model towards partnerships of mutual respect, in which low- and middle-income countries have a greater say in global institutions. “Development cannot be a closed shop, where we try to help other countries and communities without heeding their vision for the future,” he writes. The white paper has been deliberately structured by its lead author, development minister Andrew Mitchell, to go through to 2030 in the hope that Labour would pick up its themes in what Mitchell describes as “the highly unlikely event” of the Conservatives losing the next election. Due to Covid, reduced budgets, conflict and a decline in multilateralism, Mitchell says the world is woefully off-track reaching the UN sustainable development goals, and says new approaches are required, including providing public sector guarantees to mobilise private sector money. Mitchell told the Guardian: “Where we are sweating balance sheets, releasing billions of dollars of guarantees and issuing special drawing rights to create £5.3bn of extra money, the argument whether you are spending 0.5% or 0.7 % of GDP on aid is of interest but arguably less relevant since the additional mechanisms we have found to put more money into climate finance and adaptation are more important”. An official summary of the white paper, written by film director and aid advocate Richard Curtis, argues: “It is no longer possible, if it ever was, for a country to determine its future alone. Climate change does not respect national boundaries, nor do pandemics. Conflicts are becoming more numerous, frequent, and longer lasting. War in one country can affect security thousands of miles away. Poverty, conflict, and climate change often go hand in hand and drive flows of refugees.” The white paper will urge more countries to follow the UK plan for debt repayments to be immediately paused when vulnerable countries are hit by extreme weather events or health emergencies, something Mitchell describes as a simple innovation that can make a huge difference. It backs more rapid restructuring of unsustainable debt saying recent efforts have taken too long. Zambia, for instance, waited more than 18 months between staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund and an agreement among official creditors on a debt treatment. According to the UN, 3.3 billion people now live in countries where debt interest payments are greater than expenditure on health or education. The white paper will call for measures to minimise the risk of holdouts to debt restructuring by bondholders. In a major reform, British Investment International (BII), the UK’s large development investment arm, will be required to spend a minimum of half of its annual investment in low-income countries following criticisms that some of the investments have been poorly targeted at poverty alleviation. In 2022, BII investments generated £1bn ($1.3bn) of funding from elsewhere, and the businesses it backed employed 1 million people and paid $1.5bn in taxes. In a bid to prevent humanitarian disasters, as well as alleviate them, ministers will propose a minimum of 15% of UK humanitarian spending – currently £1bn a year – to go on better preparation and adaptation.",David Cameron; Politics; UK news; Conservatives; United Nations; World news,Politics
2024-08-15T02:34:46Z,Can business be a force for good? Meet the graduates asking the ‘provocative’ questions,https://www.theguardian.com/griffith-mba-leading-the-way/article/2024/aug/15/can-business-be-a-force-for-good-meet-the-graduates-asking-the-provocative-questions,"It’s no small decision to commit to postgraduate study, but when you’re driven to becoming a force for positive change in the world – and the course you’ve chosen actively supports that – the choice is much easier. Although the students drawn to Griffith University’s sustainability-focused MBA program come from a wide range of industries and professions, they share similar motivations: to future-proof their careers and businesses, and to help shape the world in impactful ways that benefit the people and planet of tomorrow. Dane Jacka, who graduated with an MBA from Griffith University in early 2023, used what he learned in his studies to start a business inspired by the concept of businesses being a tool for good in the world. Pauseful, which Jacka launched just a few months after graduating, offers workplace mindfulness and leadership development programs, and organisational advisory services. Dane Jacka, Griffith University MBA graduate Jacka had practised meditation and mindfulness for almost 30 years and saw a growing need in workplaces for ways to enhance employee wellbeing. What began as an idea took shape during his MBA studies. “There’s such a high incidence of anxiety, depression, loneliness and disconnection … as well as this increased focus on wellbeing and wellness inside of organisations that I was becoming more and more motivated to do more with mindfulness and meditation,” Jacka says. “But it was certainly the content of the MBA that inspired Pauseful, because the Griffith MBA in particular has this focus on businesses being a tool for good in the world.” Griffith’s world-renowned MBA is designed around the United Nations’ sustainable development goals (SDGs), which focus not just on environmental outcomes but also an interconnected series of targets based on creating a better, fairer world. Along with addressing climate change and environmental degradation, the SDGs tackle issues such as poverty, inequality, peace and justice. Sustainable thinking Jacka says the MBA’s sustainability focus goes well beyond environmental sustainability. “Traditionally, the idea is that businesses are merely a vehicle to generate wealth for its owners, whereas the content of the MBA is really asking the question: what if businesses are, in fact, tools for greater good in the world, and generating wealth is one of those things but it’s not the only thing, and perhaps organisations that are run purposefully are actually more successful? It’s sort of a provocative question, which, I believe, underpins the whole MBA.” From left to right: Briony Low, MBA student, Cesar Pais Soto and Kudzai Zvenyika Principal, MBA alumni With that in mind, the relationship between employees and the business changes, Jacka says. Employees are not just seen as a human resource, as in the traditional model, but as vital to the success of a purposeful business. Jacka’s drive to do more purposeful work grew over the course of his studies. “The MBA really inspired me to go for it,” he says. Along with mindfulness training, Pauseful’s leadership development programs focus on supporting future leaders to be ethical, empathetic and compassionate. Meanwhile, Pauseful’s strategic consulting work focuses on how organisations of all sizes can use purpose and meaning to create strategic advantage. Building confidence Current MBA student Iona Bird is balancing full-time work with her studies, which, she says require 20-25 hours of dedicated time each week (including two hours a week of online lectures). Her corporate accounting background led Bird to join the e-commerce accounting software company A2X in 2016. Since then, A2X has grown from startup to success story, with more than 14,000 e-commerce businesses and their accountants now using the software. Bird’s role has evolved, too. She is now the global head of customer experience and people, and has her sights set on a higher-level strategic leadership role with a sustainability focus. Iona Bird, current Griffith University MBA student The first step in pursuing this goal was to sign up for Griffith’s MBA, a decision she settled on because of the university’s reputation as a sustainability leader and the program’s alignment with her own values and career direction. “There’s a lot of opportunity to have an impactful influence on the tech industry,” Bird says. The accelerated online MBA is run in six-week blocks and Bird has three to go. Her studies have already given her a real confidence boost, she says, and at times pushed her out of her comfort zone. “It’s allowed me to refine my critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and to make sure I look at things with a holistic approach,” she says. “The program is challenging but very, very engaging.” Facilitating change Having to balance the priorities of work and study has honed Bird’s time management and prioritisation skills, and provided the opportunity for plenty of self-reflection. “I’m better able to understand my strengths and areas for growth now,” Bird says. The lectures are all online, but many students get together for study sessions and to discuss assessments between classes. “I’ve made heaps of friends and there is such a wide variety of age groups and people from all kinds of professions that you get to learn from a wide range of different perspectives,” Bird says. One of her favourite courses so far has been leading people for sustainable outcomes – a “brilliant” course for people leaders to self-reflect and learn to lead in ways that are sustainable for the future. Bird recommends Griffith’s MBA for anyone looking to expand their strategic thinking and business acumen, especially if they want to integrate sustainability into their vocation and work practices. “It’s absolutely ideal, and I think it’s a program that isn’t just for people looking for career advancement; this program makes you really feel like you could actually make a really meaningful impact on society.” Help shape a better future with the Griffith MBA.",,Griffith MBA: Leading the way
2024-08-30T01:47:41Z,Future-proof: why businesses are seeking sustainable skill sets,https://www.theguardian.com/griffith-mba-leading-the-way/article/2024/aug/30/future-proof-why-businesses-are-seeking-sustainable-skill-sets,"A growing number of progressive organisations are moving away from the traditional industrial model towards an approach that prioritises purpose as well as profits. Little wonder that leaders who have the knowledge and skills to help businesses make the transition are in such high demand. It’s no secret that, as a planet, we’re facing urgent social, environmental and economic challenges – cost of living, climate change, resource depletion and inequality among them. Prof Naomi Birdthistle, the MBA director at Griffith University, says it has become a necessity for organisations to have experts at the helm who can navigate these complexities and drive responsible solutions. “Sustainability leadership is crucial for organisational viability, reputation and positive impact on the planet and society,” Birdthistle says. “It includes economic, social and environmental dimensions, recognising that progress must benefit people, the planet and prosperity simultaneously.” Griffith has become the top choice for leaders (and the up-and-coming) who are working to create a more sustainable future within organisations or their own businesses. And, no, it isn’t just marketing spin. The Corporate Knights Better World MBA ranking has named Griffith’s MBA the world’s leading sustainable MBA for the past four years in a row. As well as covering all the bases of business strategy, each subject in Griffith’s MBA is built on progressive values that are vital for success in a sustainable, equitable economy. Why sustainable leadership is in high demand Griffith Unviersity MBA director, Naomi Birdthistle One of the reasons sustainability is such a growing focus for businesses is that customers, investors, employees and communities increasingly expect businesses to operate ethically, minimise their environmental impact and contribute positively to society. “Sustainability leaders align organisational goals with these stakeholder expectations,” Birdthistle says. To compound matters, governments worldwide are implementing stricter environmental regulations. Sustainability leaders ensure compliance with these and proactively address emerging requirements, implementing practices that drive innovation, cost savings and resilience. Griffith’s MBA is a clear standout for leaders looking to upskill and broaden their understanding of sustainability’s role in business and our global future. The world-renowned MBA program is based around the United Nations’ sustainable development goals (SDGs). A values-led education The Griffith MBA, and indeed all Griffith programs, are created with a strong focus on values, and a commitment to reconciliation with First Peoples, environmental sustainability, diversity, inclusion and social justice. “We are attracting students who are looking for this focus on sustainability,” Birdthistle says. “It’s the future leaders who want to be ethical in their thinking and in their business practices, who want to think beyond profits, to people and the planet as well. “We are attracting that mindset and that thinking, and also we’re attracting participants who want to have an experience with an institution that actually does what it says it does on the tin. It’s important to them that their values are aligned.” Professor Ashlea Troth, deputy director of Griffith’s Centre for Work, Organisation and Wellbeing Prof Ashlea Troth, the deputy director of Griffith’s Centre for Work, Organisation and Wellbeing, points out that the Griffith MBA was the first course of its kind to underpin its courses with three core values (responsible leadership, sustainable business practices and an Asia-Pacific perspective) that are all intrinsically linked to the UN’s 17 SDGs. “The Griffith University MBA is truly values-led and the staff and MBA students genuinely embrace these values in their teaching, research and work lives,” she says. “We attract MBA students who embrace this ethos, want to make a difference and view themselves as part of the solution for the world’s environmental, social and economic challenges.” Training tomorrow’s leaders to put people first Organisations run by emotionally intelligent leaders are a step ahead when it comes to building healthy and productive workplace cultures. Troth says healthy workplaces have become less about lunchtime yoga classes and more about genuinely supporting employee wellbeing with comprehensive workplace mental health strategies, policies and practices – and that these should have a preventative focus. “While yoga classes or massages are a nice gesture and might reflect good intentions, they might actually be viewed as a tokenistic or Band-Aid gesture by the organisation to avoid addressing serious underlying issues such as a toxic or stressful work environment,” she says. People with higher emotional intelligence are not only more likely to emerge as leaders but are more likely to have employees that report higher job satisfaction and demonstrate higher job performance, says Troth, who teaches MBA students about leading for sustainable people outcomes. Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognise and manage one’s own and others’ emotions. “Leaders not only need to regulate their own emotions using various strategies, they also must routinely help others to regulate or manage their emotions,” Troth says. “People often assume sustainability is all about environmental and financial sustainability, but in this course, the underlying premise is that sustainability should also focus on sustaining the workforce – so people don’t get burnt out and leave or underperform. In most cases, the workforce is an organisation’s biggest asset, so energy needs to be put into supporting them and creating inclusive and healthy workplaces.” Diverse perspectives Diversity and inclusion are issues that are evolving in the business context. Along with influencing hiring policies, a focus on inclusion ensures decision-making processes consider the perspectives of different genders, First Peoples, a variety of world opinions, and different stakeholders inside and outside an organisation. Birdthistle says: “Across the whole MBA, we have content that is aligned with Griffith’s values in understanding First Peoples’ ways of knowing, doing and being.” First Peoples academic staff and First Peoples MBA alumni have co-designed content and shared their experience and knowledge with students throughout the curriculum, which Birdthistle says adds a new dimension to the MBA and expands its focus. “So, yes, the MBA is about sustainability, but it’s also ingraining in the thinking of our future leaders an understanding of the First Peoples’ knowledge to solve our grand challenges that we are faced with.” Help shape a better future with the Griffith MBA.",,Griffith MBA: Leading the way
2024-09-07T13:00:18Z,Elon Musk is intrigued by the idea women can’t think freely because of ‘low T’ | Arwa Mahdawi,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/sep/07/elon-musk-women-testosterone,"Maybe he’s born with it, maybe it’s ketamine Every time I think Elon Musk can’t possibly sink any lower, he grabs a shovel and starts digging. In recent months, Apartheid Clyde (as he is nicknamed) has been doing his best to get Donald Trump elected by any means possible. As well as throwing money and an endorsement Trump’s way, Musk has posted multiple false election claims and reposted a fake version of Kamala Harris’s first campaign video that has been doctored to make her say she is the “ultimate diversity hire”. When Musk isn’t meddling in politics, he’s busy posting misogynistic memes on X, the social media platform he has slowly been turning into an advertiser-haemorrhaging cesspool of hate. He’s posted an extraordinary amount of unhinged content in the past, but last Sunday he really outdid himself: the billionaire reposted a tweet from “Autism Capital” that suggested that “women and low T men” are not able to think freely because they “can’t defend themselves physically”. The only people who can think freely are “high T alpha males and aneurotypical people ... this is why a Republic of high status males is best for decision making. Democratic, but a democracy only for those who are free to think.” So what did Musk write in response to this wildly sexist post that originally appeared on 4chan, the far-right messaging board that has been described as the “blueprint for white supremacist groups”? He wrote: “Interesting observation.” It’s possible, I suppose, that Musk meant “interesting” in the sense that British people often use it – which is as a polite way of saying: “That’s total nonsense, you ridiculous loon.” But judging by Musk’s past behaviour, one imagines there’s a very good chance he found the post genuinely interesting. Of course, Musk wouldn’t be the first billionaire to dabble with casual thought experiments such as: what if we stripped women of all their rights? Peter Thiel, who runs Palantir, the dystopian technology company, and who has bankrolled JD Vance’s political career, once mused that women getting the right to vote had been bad for democracy. And we all know what Vance’s boss, Trump, thinks of women. But this isn’t just about women: Musk platforming terms like “low T men” shows how toxic masculinity hurts men, too, and how testosterone has been politicized. Ever since 2016, “it has become a strange kind of orthodoxy among American conservatives that being a liberally minded man who supports feminism is simply a result of having abnormally low levels of testosterone”, the Guardian’s Sam Wolfson wrote back in 2019. This is partly thanks to a dubious study linking leftwing politics to lower testosterone. Being “low T” has become the ultimate insult in certain circles and the likes of Trump have paraded their testosterone levels on national TV. Businesses have popped up to monetize male insecurity and promote dubious ways to boost testosterone. Last year, a startup called T Party invited tech bros in Silicon Valley to gatherings where they all tested their testosterone together, for example. And who can forget when Tucker Carlson had a personal trainer on his show to extol the virtues of “testicle tanning” to boost testosterone? There are, to be clear, serious concerns to be had about dropping testosterone levels. Studies show that there has been a “substantial” decrease in US men’s testosterone levels since the 1980s. Sperm counts have also plummeted around the globe. But that, it should go without saying, has nothing to do with feminism and a lot to do with forever chemicals and environmental stressors. Ridiculous 4chan memes aside, there is also an interesting conversation to be had about the effects of testosterone levels on decision-making – it’s a question that has been studied for a very long time. And you know what those studies show? That testosterone makes men “less likely to question their impulses” and is linked to “less self-reflection”. Which sounds a lot like Mr Musk, doesn’t it? Not that it’s meant to imply that Musk is bursting with testosterone, to be clear. I hear ketamine, which Musk is very fond of – and says investors should want him to keep taking – can sometimes have a similar effect on people’s ability to make rational decisions. Or perhaps he’s just high on misogyny: it’s one hell of a drug. Man accused of enlisting strangers to rape drugged wife goes on trial in France This story is absolutely harrowing and Gisèle Pélicot, who has waived her legal right to anonymity so justice can be done in public, is an incredibly impressive figure. What isn’t impressive is some of the coverage – in particular, this disgraceful headline (which has since been changed) in the Telegraph: “Wife takes public revenge on the men who ‘raped her every night on husband’s orders’.” It should go without saying that justice – much overdue – is not revenge. Nor were any of the more than 80 men who raped Pélicot following “orders”. Olympian Rebecca Cheptegei murdered by former partner The Ugandan athlete was set on fire and sustained burns on 80% of her body in the attack in Kenya, where she had trained. Cheptegei is the third female athlete to be killed by an intimate partner in Kenya in the last three years. Why women (still) aren’t welcome on the internet This week’s edition of Caitlin Dewey’s excellent newsletter Links I Would Gchat You If We Were Friends contained a link to an award-winning 2014 essay about online misogyny by Amanda Hess titled Why Women Aren’t Welcome on the Internet. It’s 10 years old but it’s still very much worth reading because basically nothing has changed – largely because misogynists like Elon Musk run these platforms. Women are still subject to relentless abuse online and we’re essentially left to just deal with it. My Twitter account is now locked and I don’t use Instagram because waking up every day to harassment and death threats just isn’t worth it. It shouldn’t have to be like this.

Judging by what has happened when Israeli forces have killed other American citizens, including Rachel Corrie and Shireen Abu Akleh, Biden will respond by shrugging his shoulders and signing off on even more weapons for Israel.

2024-06-24T08:23:40Z,Geologists raise concerns over possible censorship and bias in Chinese chatbot,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jun/24/geologists-censorship-bias-chinese-chatbot-geogpt,"Geologists have raised concerns about potential Chinese censorship and bias in a chatbot being developed with the backing of the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS), one of the world’s largest scientific organisations and a Unesco partner. The GeoGPT chatbot is aimed at geoscientists and researchers, particularly in the global south, to help them develop their understanding of earth sciences by drawing on swaths of data and research on billions of years of the planet’s history. It is an initiative from Deep-time Digital Earth (DDE), a largely Chinese-funded programme founded in 2019 to enhance international scientific cooperation and help countries to realise the UN’s sustainable development goals. Part of the underlying AI for GeoGPT is Qwen, a large language model built by the Chinese tech company Alibaba. One of those who had tested a pre-release version of the chatbot, Prof Paul Cleverley, a geologist and computer scientist, claimed in an article recently published in the Geoscientist, the magazine of the Geological Society, the UK’s professional association for geologists, that GeoGPT had “serious issues around a lack of transparency, state censorship, and potential copyright infringement”. Responding to the article, DDE representatives Michael Stephenson, Hans Thybo, Chengshan Wang and Ishwaran Natarajan said the chatbot also used Meta’s Llama, another large language model, and that during testing they had not noticed any state censorship, which they said was “unlikely” given that the system was “based entirely in geoscience information”. The DDE academics said: “Problems with GeoGPT have been largely solved, but the team will be working to improve the system even more. It must be stressed that at present GeoGPT has not been released and is not in the public domain.” David Giles, a professional geoscientist, said it was “blatantly untrue” that a system based on geoscience data could be free of sensitive information. Tests on Qwen, part of GeoGPT’s underlying AI, reveal geoscience-related questions can produce answers that appear to be influenced by narratives set by the Chinese Communist party. For example, when asked how many people have died in a mining operation in Ghana run by the Shaanxi Mining Company, Qwen says: “I’m unable to provide current or specific information about events, including mining accidents, as my knowledge is based on data up until 2021 and I don’t have real-time access to news updates.” The same question posed to ChatGPT, the chatbot developed by the US company OpenAI, produces the answer: “The Shaanxi Mining Company in Ghana has experienced multiple fatal incidents, resulting in a total of 61 deaths since 2013. This includes a significant explosion in January 2019 that alone claimed 16 lives.” It is not clear what kind of answer GeoGPT, which is still in development, would give to this question. Dr Natarajan Ishwaran, the head of international relations for DDE, said: “The team building GeoGPT has full independence. We can assure you that GeoGPT – currently in an exploratory phase and not yet open to the public – will not be affected by any state censorship.” He added that users would be able to choose between using Alibaba’s Qwen or Meta’s Llama as the model for GeoGPT. Geoscientific research and data include commercially and strategically valuable information about deposits of natural resources such as lithium, which are vital for the green transition. Giles said there was a risk that a Chinese-developed platform could “filter” information to withhold content that was useful for “mineral reconnaissance”. He added: “China is very aggressively looking for minerals across the globe. There is a strategic advantage and an economic advantage in looking for mineral reserves.” An article published in 2020 by Chen Jun, an academic at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said DDE, the scientific programme that created GeoGPT, would “help enhance China’s detection and security capabilities in global resources and energy”. Stephenson, Thybo, Wang and Natarajan, from DDE, said the 2020 article aimed “to encourage Chinese scientists to get involved in international science programmes” and was “purely the opinion of the author”, not of DDE or the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Mohammad Hoque, a senior lecturer in hydrogeology and environmental geoscience at the University of Portsmouth, said “one danger” of using a Chinese language model for academic research was that “there will be some bias, because they have to obey local laws”. GeoGPT’s terms of use state that prompting the chatbot to generate content that “undermines national security” and “incites subversion of state power” is prohibited. The terms of use also state that it is governed by the laws of China. Hoque said GeoGPT had a greater obligation of transparency because it was developed under the auspices of an international research collaboration. “The most important thing would be to know what data they use to fine-tune and train [GeoGPT]. We have an expectation to know under IUGS.” John Ludden, the president of the IUGS, said the GeoGPT database would be made public “only if the IUGS is satisfied that the appropriate governance is in place”. Ishwaran said when GeoGPT opened to the public its training database would be made available “to those who wish to have it”. Geologists interviewed by the Guardian said the extent of DDE’s links to China were not widely known among professionals. According to a planning document published in 2021, the multimillion-pound project is “almost 99%” funded by sources in China. The programme is part of the IUGS, an international NGO representing more than 1 million geoscientists in 121 countries, including the UK’s Geological Society. Its secretariat is based in Beijing and receives “tremendous” financial and logistical support from the Chinese government, according to the organisation’s 2023 annual report. Ludden said: “The best thing for science is to be open and share data. DDE does this for geological data if openly available [and] will lead to inward investment in any nation … [and] discoveries in research.”",Chatbots; Artificial intelligence (AI); China; Censorship; Geology; Technology; Science; World news; Asia Pacific; Computing; Global development; Business,Technology
2024-07-23T07:00:08Z,"Our landmark book revealed the cost of inequality. Fifteen years later, things have only got worse | Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/23/landmark-book-spirit-level-cost-inequality-fifteen-years-later-worse-labour,"When we first wrote The Spirit Level: Why Equality is Better For Everyone, we had no idea it would become a bestseller. The book was filled with graphs and statistics, for one thing. But in the 15 years since it was published, we’ve been invited to give well over 1,000 lectures and conferences to tell people about our research. Our findings were clear then and are still true now. When economic inequality gets worse, so does our health and wellbeing. Inequality can affect a society’s death rates, its levels of chronic disease, and the amount of violence (including murders) it experiences. What we weren’t prepared for when we first wrote the book was how much worse things could get. Today, inequality seeps into almost every facet of life. Children in the most unequal societies are more likely to experience bullying, do less well in school, and have fewer opportunities for social mobility. Research since the book came out has added gambling, domestic violence and the mistreatment of children to the list of problems all correlated to higher levels of inequality. We know that people in more economically unequal societies become more status-obsessed and consumerist, which fuels environmental breakdown. At the same time, social cohesion – the likelihood of people participating in society through things such as neighbourhood associations, political parties, volunteering and clubs – is lower where inequality is worse. Crucially, since publishing The Spirit Level, we have used established epidemiological criteria to show that these associations are not simply correlations: inequality actually causes poorer outcomes. And our data show that even small differences in inequality matter: marginally reducing inequalitycan have a big impact on people’s health and wellbeing. For instance, if the UK were to reduce its inequality to the average for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, our imprisonment rate could be reduced by as much as 25%, saving £1.6bn per year. Although the biggest effects are on the poor, inequality affects a large majority of the population. For example, in more unequal countries, even the better off have worse health than they would if they lived in a more equal society. The Spirit Level was published during the final months of the last Labour government, and although David Cameron name-checked the book and its findings during his election campaign, his party’s economic policies helped exacerbate inequality. Fourteen years of austerity and cuts to the social safety net, combined with a pandemic, soaring rents and rising energy bills, have all helped to increase poverty and deprivation at the bottom of society – while those at the top have watched their wealth grow. The gap between rich and poor in Britain is now as high as it was in the early 1930s. In addition, people, and especially young people, are experiencing substantially higher levels of mental distress and lower wellbeing than they were the last time we had a Labour government. Part of the reason is because inequality puts us in a hierarchy, one above the other. It reinforces the idea that some people are worth much more than others, strengthening what psychologists call the “social-evaluative threat”, where people worry more about how they’re seen and judged. This increases status anxiety and exacerbates issues of self-doubt at all levels in society. Income and wealth become the overwhelmingly important measures of status, so that making money and buying things become even more important to people. As a result, some are overcome with a sense of inadequacy and depression, while others respond with narcissism. This week, we’re presenting the Labour government with a new, updated set of Spirit Level analyses. In an index of health, social and environmental performance, using robust sources of publicly available data, we augment the 10 health and social problems we considered in our book (infant mortality, life expectancy, mental illness, obesity, educational attainment, teenage births, homicides, imprisonment, social mobility and trust) with five environmental issues (the rich’s carbon emissions, recycling, air pollution, progress towards the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals and multilateralism). There is a clear trend, with more unequal societies having significantly worse scores. The UK is still the most unequal country in western Europe, and ranks 18 out of 22 among the rich market democracies in our index. It does particularly badly on child wellbeing, infant mortality and social mobility. All these are strongly correlated to inequality, which poses a serious obstacle to Labour’s mission of breaking down barriers to opportunity. Our analysis also helps to explain why our prisons have become so overcrowded: the penal system becomes more punitive in more unequal societies, and puts more people behind bars. So what should we do about this? There are plenty of policies that would help make the UK more equal. The government should implement the socioeconomic duty of the 2010 Equality Act, which requires public bodies to consider how their policies can improve outcomes for people who face social and economic inequalities such as poverty and deprivation. It could end the two-child benefits cap and the bedroom tax, impose wealth taxes, raise taxes on capital gains and unearned income and introduce a proportional property tax. Some people will argue that doing so is unfeasible because it will drive the rich away. But not only does research from the London School of Economics suggests that this is unlikely to happen, but the real truth is that we can’t afford the super-rich. They make us all poorer, and refusing to tax them properly only makes public services more expensive for everyone else. Indeed, the Equality Trust has estimated that if inequality was reduced to the average levels in other rich nations, Britain could save more than £100bn a year on health and imprisonment alone. Alongside his huge parliamentary majority, Keir Starmer should be emboldened by the popularity of these policies. More than half of voters at the general election cast their votes for progressive parties that championed change, fairness and hope. It is time for an ambitious and overarching mission to focus policymaking squarely on creating a more equal society. It’s what people want, and our evidence suggests that the benefits would be transformative. Richard Wilkinson is emeritus professor of public health at the University of Nottingham.

2024-04-03T05:00:21Z,"As a widow, I faced humiliation and stigma. Now I’m speaking up for others |  Roseline Orwa",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/apr/03/widow-kenya-east-africa-widows,"In February, Asenath Rotich became a widow, after the death of her partner, marathon runner and world record-holder Kelvin Kiptum, in a road accident. Unlike the majority of more than 8 million widows in Kenya, Rotich’s future is being provided for. The government has built her a house and is working to secure a job for her so she can care for her two children. In contrast, consider the recent case of Silvia that was shared with me by a community radio journalist. Silvia is a 39-year-old widow with five children, whose home in Siaya County was demolished during a land ownership dispute. Despite widespread media coverage and public outcry, justice remains elusive for her. As east Africa is plagued by instability and conflicts, the number of widows is rising, but they are not afforded adequate rights. Widows frequently encounter discrimination – not only socially, but also when it comes to inheritance and property ownership. Widowhood rites, which are meant to honour the deceased and demonstrate the widow’s grief, can make women more vulnerable by subjecting them to marginalisation as well as psychological and physical indignity. According to the World Widows Report by the Loomba Foundation, the global population of widows stands at a staggering 258 million, looking after 585 million children. About 38 million widows live in extreme poverty. This report was completed before the Covid-19 pandemic, which has exacerbated widows’ plight, as have ongoing conflicts such as those in Syria, South Sudan, Central African Republic, Ukraine and Gaza. The Boko Haram insurgency is reported to have taken a devastating toll in north-east Nigeria, south-east Niger, west Chad, and north Cameroon. As a widow of 16 years, I intimately understand the myriad challenges. From enduring forced sexual cleansing rituals to grappling with stigma and being disinherited, I empathise with the deep-rooted injustices that widows confront daily. These personal experiences fuel my commitment to the organisation I founded 12 years ago, Rona Foundation. We are dedicated to legal advocacy, economic support and emergency response initiatives, aiming to address injustices and promote women’s independence and wellbeing. I oversee the coordination of more than 9,000 widows in Siaya, which grants me a deep understanding of the triumphs and challenges within our movement to achieve rights for these women. Most of our members endure persistent economic disparities, with many facing challenges such as harmful widowhood traditions, poor access to justice and difficulty obtaining social benefits such as pensions or insurance. A lack of legal and social protection perpetuates their vulnerability. Our struggle isn’t just against societal norms, however. Grassroots organisations such as mine often struggle to survive due to resource scarcity. Over the past decade, I’ve seen donor organisations provide our movement with short-term assistance, which of course helps, but not enough. This leaves us vulnerable to adversity and unable to sustain our efforts. Too often, movements such as ours simply starve and die. Clearly, we need those commitments, but we also need stability and, above all, long-term funding. Despite such obstacles, there are glimmers of hope. This includes the recent recognition of widows by UN Women at the Commission on the Status of Women. Now they are framed as a category of women who face some of the greatest risks of rising poverty, food insecurity and violence. This recognition has taken years of advocacy to achieve, mostly by widow movements with few financial resources. The establishment of the African Widows Summit also offers hope for the future. It brings together widow-focused organisations, and next meets in June in Zanzibar. Recently, I championed the election of three widows as legislators in my county, and I have mobilised thousands of women to support landmark legislation aimed at advancing widow rights. Hope Nwakwesi, the president of the African Widows Summit, is working on advocacy, too. “In Nigeria, we are dedicated to inspiring widows to advocate for their rights and urging governments to take decisive action to empower them,” she said. Until widows have adequate rights, Africa will not achieve the UN’s sustainable development goals by 2030. Will we get there? I try to remain hopeful.

2024-08-16T12:00:30Z,Heat inequality ‘causing thousands of unreported deaths in poor countries’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/16/heat-inequality-causing-thousands-of-unreported-deaths-in-poor-countries,"Heat inequality is causing thousands of unreported deaths in poor countries and communities across the world, a leading analyst of climate impacts has warned, following global temperature records that may not have been seen in 120,000 years. Sweltering conditions act as a stealthy killer that preys on the most economically fragile, said Friederike Otto, co-founder of World Weather Attribution, in an appeal for the media and authorities to pay more attention to the dangers. “Heatwaves are the deadliest type of extreme weather but they don’t leave a trail of destruction or striking images of devastation. They kill poor, lonely people in rich countries, and poor people working outdoors in developing countries,” said Otto, who is also a senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute of Imperial College London. “In the last 13 months, there will be thousands and thousands of stories of poor people dying in heat that will never be told.” The advice comes amid growing concern about the hidden toll of heat inequality. Last month, the UN secretary general announced a call to action on extreme heat, with a focus on care for the vulnerable and protection of exposed workers. “Extreme heat is increasingly tearing through economies, widening inequalities, undermining the sustainable development goals and killing people. It is estimated to kill almost half a million people a year; that’s about 30 times more than tropical cyclones,” António Guterres pointed out. This followed the world’s three hottest days on record on 21, 22 and 23 July. As well as passing the previous peak in datasets going back to 1940, climatologists said it was probably also the highest temperature on Earth in about 120,000 years, based on evidence from tree rings and ice cores. It did not come not without warning. Up to July, the Earth had set 13 consecutive monthly temperature records, primarily because of human burning of forests, gas, oil and coal. A precise death toll from these searing extremes may never be calculated but it is certain that lower income groups will have been worst affected because heat inequality is self-reinforcing. While the rich glide from air-conditioned homes in air-conditioned cars to air-conditioned offices, restaurants and shopping malls, the heat from these artificially cooled environments is sent on to the street outside, where less advantaged workers sweat as couriers, construction workers or road cleaners. Equality campaigners say the vulnerability gap continues at home. “Deaths from heat are shaped by inequality – a heatwave is far more deadly for someone living in a tin shack than it is for someone in an air-conditioned house,” said Alex Maitland, inequality policy adviser at Oxfam International. “Over the coming decades, deaths from heat stress are forecast to rise dramatically in low-income countries. The cruel irony is that people who die from heat are the least responsible for soaring temperatures. The richest 1% emit more than two-thirds of the world combined, with their carbon emissions in 2019 alone enough to cause the heat-related deaths of 1.3 million people.” The inequality of suffering extends to worship and migration. More than 80% of the 1,300 Hajj pilgrims who died of heat-related causes in June were unauthorised pilgrims, who could not afford air-conditioned accommodation and transport and had no access to cooling tents and water stations. Many were staying on the streets in temperatures that approached 50C. Studies by World Weather Attribution found the heatwave was made up to 2.5C hotter by climate change. “This additional heat would have been the difference between life and death for many of these people,” Otto said. Asylum seekers, who are often escaping heat and drought, are also at a much higher risk. In June, dozens of Sudanese migrants died from the scorching heat at an illegal border crossing into Egypt. The victims included entire families, said aid groups. Later the same month, the bodies of three Mexican migrants were found in the Sonoran desert in Arizona near the US border as a a brutal heatwave gripped the region. The El Paso Border Patrol sector, which includes parts of Texas and New Mexico, said migrant deaths more than doubled from 2022 to 2023 as a result of the temperature rise. Last year, the charred bodies of 18 Syrian asylum seekers were found after a wildfire in the Dadia region of north-eastern Greece. In less developed countries, the authorities often do not have the means to collect data or investigate individual deaths. This is particularly true in conflict regions, such as Afghanistan, Mali, Sudan, Somalia and Central African Republic. An increasing number of countries are taking action to protect workers from heat by implementing new laws. In Armenia, for example, special breaks should be granted when temperatures go above 40C. Some countries set different limits depending on how intensive the work is. In Belgium, the limits range between 29C for light physical work and 18C for very heavy work. In Hungary, by comparison, thresholds vary from 27C to 31C. Cyprus, meanwhile, distinguishes between workers who are “acclimatised” to the heat and those who are not; safe working limits for the latter are 2.5C lower. Dr Halshka Graczyk, a technical specialist on occupational safety and health at the International Labour Organization, said there was evidence of clear productivity loss for every degree rise in temperature. Although temperature limits at work were increasingly common, they tended to be set in an ad hoc way, she said. “There is no algorithm, there is no way to say your baseline temperature in your country is X and therefore your population is acclimatised to around this temperature.” Nor was there enough monitoring and evaluation to know if the set limits helped protect human health and improve productivity. Enforcement of these laws is also a continuing tussle. Qatar is one of several Gulf countries that has summertime bans on outdoor work during the hottest times of the day, prohibiting it from 1 June to 15 September between 10am and 3.30pm. However, an investigation by the Independent found hundreds of breaches last year, mostly in the construction industry. Enforcing indoor limits, such as in factories, could be even harder, given that these workplaces are less visible. In Indonesia, a lawsuit brought by a group of young people claims, among other things, that insufficient government action on climate crisis is breaching their right to work and earn a decent living. In Bangladesh, a court ordered a nationwide shutdown of schools in April because of a severe heatwave. Otto urged great global attention on this dimly understood crisis. “We just don’t know how many people are being killed by extreme heat in poor countries. But due to their much higher exposure, there’s no reason to think it’d be a smaller proportion than in rich countries, where we know of the thousands dying,” she said. There is a huge need to report on these dangers, again and again.” Rather than illustrating heat reports with happy people on the beach, she said the media needed to consider often-hidden and preventable tragedies both in faraway parts of the world and in marginalised communities in their own countries. “To tackle change, we need to create a more equal world, but we also need to tackle inequality at home.”",Extreme heat; Extreme weather; Climate crisis; Sustainable development goals; Environment; UK news; World news,Environment
2024-01-04T17:30:09Z,"Global economy faces period of prolonged weakness, UN warns",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/04/global-economy-faces-period-of-prolonged-weakness-un-warns,"The world faces a protracted period of weak economic growth that will undermine progress on sustainable development, the UN has warned, as it urged countries to raise investment to tackle the climate emergency. Its annual assessment of the state of the global economy presents a sombre outlook for growth as countries grapple with the impact of higher borrowing costs, geopolitical tensions and heightened risk of climate disasters. Global growth will slow to 2.4% this year from 2.7% in 2023 – significantly below the pre-Covid pandemic trend of 3% – amid “strong headwinds” facing the planet, the World Economic Situation and Prospects report forecasts. The warning comes as leading central banks continue to deploy high interest rates in response to the sharpest inflationary burst in decades after the economic impact of the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Warning that sluggish economic growth could undermine progress towards the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs) – which include ending poverty and tackling global heating – the report said more international cooperation was required to stimulate growth and promote the green transition. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, said: “2024 must be the year when we break out of this quagmire. By unlocking big, bold investments, we can drive sustainable development and climate action, and put the global economy on a stronger growth path for all.” The latest forecasts show global inflation is projected to decline from about 5.7% in 2023 to 3.9% this year, helping to ease the pressure on households and businesses. However, the report warns price pressures remain elevated, while sounding the alarm that any further escalation of geopolitical conflicts risks a renewed inflationary burst. The UN’s findings come amid concerns over the impact of disruption to shipping through the vital Red Sea trade route after attacks by Houthi rebels, launched in response to the Israel-Gaza war amid an uneasy diplomatic climate in the Middle East. Economists have warned sustained disruption to shipping, or a wider conflict in the region involving Iran, or the closure of the Strait of Hormuz to shipping – a key route for shipments of oil and gas – could add significantly to global inflation. The UN said it was vital that governments avoided “self-defeating fiscal consolidations” and instead offered more financial support to stimulate economic growth at a time when central banks were keeping interest rates high. “In addition, global climate finance must be massively scaled up. Reducing – and eventually eliminating – fossil fuel subsidies, following through on international financing commitments, such as the $100bn pledge to support developing countries, and promoting technology transfer are critical for strengthening climate action worldwide,” it said.",Global economy; Economics; Business; United Nations; International trade; Middle East and north Africa; António Guterres,Business
2024-06-11T23:01:08Z,"Tobacco, alcohol, processed foods and fossil fuels ‘kill 2.7m a year in Europe’",https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jun/12/tobacco-alcohol-ultra-processed-foods-fossil-fuels-deaths,"Tobacco, alcohol, ultra-processed foods (UPFs) and fossil fuels kill 2.7 million people a year in Europe, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), which has called on governments to impose tougher regulation of health-harming products. In a groundbreaking report , the WHO said powerful industries were driving ill-health and premature death by using “misleading” marketing and interfering in governments’ efforts to prevent killer diseases such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes. The new report calculates that tobacco, fossil fuels, UPFs and alcohol are responsible for more than 7,400 deaths every day across Europe’s 53 states. Overall the four industries cause an estimated 2.7 million deaths annually in Europe, about a quarter (24.5%) of all mortality. The UN health agency’s findings amount to an unprecedented attack on the huge damage major corporations and their products are inflicting on human health. The report describes how “big industry” uses overt and covert methods to boost their profits by delaying and derailing policies to improve population health. “A small number of transnational corporations … wield significant power over the political and legal contexts in which they operate, and obstruct public interest regulations which could impact their profit margins,” the WHO said. Dr Hans Henri P Kluge, the WHO regional director for Europe, said: “Industry tactics include exploitation of vulnerable people through targeted marketing strategies, misleading consumers, and making false claims about the benefits of their products or their environmental credentials.” The tactics deployed by “major commercial industries” are undermining measures to reduce smoking, drinking and obesity, which are the biggest causes of avoidable ill-heath. The figures follow 2023 research which found that alcohol, tobacco, processed food and beverages, and fossil fuels caused 19 million deaths a year globally, or 34% of all deaths. The WHO analysis shows that all European countries are off-track to meet the UN’s sustainable development goals of halting the rise in obesity or cutting smoking among those aged 15 and over by 30%. The 53 countries between them consume more alcohol than any other region globally. Despite the health risks, only a minority of European countries have banned smoking in public places, while efforts to make harmful products less appealing through plain packaging, alcohol taxation and food labelling were also not widely implemented, the report noted. “With the notable exception of tobacco marketing laws that have been adopted in many countries, global efforts to regulate harmful marketing have, at best, been underwhelming,” the report concludes. “While legal measures regulating alcohol and unhealthy food marketing are in existence in several countries across the WHO European region and across the world, these are often narrow in scope, focused on specific media or settings, certain population groups or on specific marketing techniques, and therefore confer insufficient protection.” The WHO estimates that tobacco accounts for more than 1 million deaths a year, 10% of all deaths in Europe. Nearly 600,000 [578,908] deaths are caused each year by fossil fuels (5% of all deaths), while alcohol causes more than 400,000 deaths a year [426,857]. And more than 350,000 people die each year from consuming too much processed meat, sugary drinks and fatty, salty food. Launching the report, Frank Vandenbroucke, the Belgian deputy prime minister, said: “For too long we have considered risk factors as being mostly linked to individual choices. We need to reframe the problem as a systemic problem, where policy has to counter ‘hyper-consumption environments’, restrict marketing, and stop interference in policymaking.” The report urges governments across Europe to impose much tougher regulation of how health-harming products are marketed, introduce curbs on monopolistic practices and lobbying, and ensure trade agreements and economic laws prioritise public health. The World Cancer Research Fund urged people to follow a largely plant-based diet more often and limit their drinking in order to reduce their risk of getting the disease. “Our evidence shows that eating a variety of plant-based foods as well as wholegrains, fruit and pulses, and limiting your consumption of alcohol, are effective ways to reduce your risk of cancer,” said Kendra Chow, its policy and public affairs manager. Dr Kawther Hashem, a lecturer in public health nutrition at Queen Mary University of London and the campaign lead at Action on Sugar, said the next UK government after the 4 July general election should compel food and drink manufacturers to reformulate their products. Responding to the study, Rebeca Fernández, the director for food safety, research and innovation at FoodDrinkEurope, which represents the European food and drink industry, said: “To connect the consumption of processed foods with the tobacco and fossil fuel industries is irresponsible and outrageously misleading. We all need food – and we all need processed food. “Unfortunately the WHO report does not acknowledge that there is no agreed definition of what ultra-processed foods are, let alone their impact on health.” Ulrich Adam, the director general of spiritsEurope, which represents the spirits industry in Europe, also questioned WHO’s methodology, which he claimed “undermines” its credibility. He added: “While there is more to be done to tackle the harmful use of alcohol in Europe, alcohol consumption has fallen by 10% since 2010, and deaths linked to alcohol have fallen by over 30% over the same period.” Nathalie Darge, the director general of Tobacco Europe, which represents the three largest tobacco manufacturers, said: “Tobacco Europe and its members are committed to reducing the health impact of smoking in Europe by investing in innovative and potentially less harmful novel tobacco and nicotine products to support adult smokers considering changing their consumption patterns. “This is a unique opportunity to limit the harm associated with smoking and contribute to the objectives of Europe’s Beating Cancer plan.” • This article was amended on 12 June 2024.

2024-03-21T23:01:20Z,"Women and girls suffer first when droughts hit poor and rural areas, says UN",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/21/women-and-girls-suffer-first-when-droughts-hit-poor-and-rural-areas-says-un,"Women and girls are the first to suffer when drought strikes poor and rural areas, and water strategies around the world must reflect this, the UN has said in a plea to countries to mend conflicts over water resources. Stress on water resources, which is being exacerbated by the climate crisis, as well as overuse and pollution of the world’s freshwater systems, is a large source of conflict, according to the latest UN world water development report. The impacts of sharing water, and the possibilities of harnessing cooperation over water resources into wider peace strategies, are often overlooked, the report’s authors found. Better cooperation over freshwater access would also play a role in improving the lives of women and girls. Women and girls carry primary responsibility for water collection in poor and rural areas around the world, and a lack of safe sanitation is a factor in girls dropping out of education, and increases their vulnerability and that of women. Audrey Azoulay, director general of Unesco, the UN agency that publishes the annual report on behalf of UN-Water, said: “As water stress increases, so do the risks of local or regional conflict. Unesco’s message is clear: if we want to preserve peace, we must act swiftly not only to safeguard water resources but also to enhance regional and global cooperation in this area.” Access to water is a vital issue in the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Some observers have accused Israel of “weaponising” access to fresh water, as Gaza is reliant on Israel for most of its water supply. Hundreds of thousands of children are in severe hunger or facing near-famine in Gaza, while a lack of clean water is increasing thirst as well as disrupting medical treatment and hygiene. The UN’s annual world water development report did not delve into such conflicts, as that would have been “too politically sensitive”, according to the report’s editor-in-chief, Rick Connor. He said: “Water has most often been a tool, a target or a victim of warfare but not typically the cause of war. Disputes over water can occur when demand exceeds supply, when availability is compromised due to pollution, when access to an allocation of water is restricted, or when water supply and sanitation services are disrupted. These disputes can range from legal disputes to violent altercations, often reflecting event specific and location specific social, political, environmental, demographic conditions.” The impacts of water shortages and tensions over water include forced migration, food insecurity and other health threats and particular dangers for women and girls, the report found. Connor also said: “International humanitarian law, including the Geneva convention, explicitly prohibits the targeting of civilian water infrastructure. Tools at the international level to promote peace through water, include agreements and cooperation over internationally shared waters and human-rights-based approaches.” The report found that tensions over water were exacerbating conflicts around the world. But while the role of water in war has often been cited, too little attention has been paid to the potential for cooperation over water to engender or preserve peace, according to Alvaro Lario, the president of the International Fund for Agricultural Development who is also chair of UN-Water. “Water, when managed sustainably and equitably, can be a source of peace and prosperity. It is also the literal lifeblood of agriculture, the major socioeconomic driver for billions of people,” he said. Little progress has been made on water issues in recent years as the climate crisis, pollution and overuse of freshwater resources in some areas have put further stress on water. Nearly half of the world’s population lacks access to hygienic sanitation, and about 2.2 billion people cannot rely on a safe supply of drinking water. These levels of unmet need around the world have increased markedly over the past two decades, despite being targeted as one of the UN’s sustainable development goals for 2030. Instead, if trends continue, water shortages are likely to affect even more people in the future. Global freshwater demand will outstrip supply by 40% by the end of this decade, according to the preliminary findings of the biggest report yet on the world’s water, which is due to be published this September by the Global Commission on the Economics of Water, which is separate to the annual world water development report of UN-Water. In 2022 about half of the world’s population experienced severe water scarcity for at least part of the year, and between 2002 and 2021 droughts afflicted more than 1.4 billion people. • This article was amended on 22 March 2024.

2024-04-14T10:43:47Z,At last G20 is showing how to finance an assault on poverty | Larry Elliott,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/apr/14/at-last-g20-showing-how-finance-assault-poverty-lula,"All things considered, the world’s richest countries have emerged from the global pandemic in better shape than they could have imagined when Covid-19 first appeared just over four years ago. To be sure, the impact of lockdown and its aftermath has been painful, but the effects on poor countries have been far more severe. Rich countries were able to rack up budget deficits to pay for furloughs and prevent mass unemployment. Rich countries could print money through quantitative easing schemes without the risk that the financial markets would punish them. Rich-country governments could subsidise energy bills after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Poor countries could do none of these things. In 2015, the international community set itself targets – the sustainable development goals (SDGs) – to be hit by 2030. The first two goals were the elimination of extreme poverty and achieving a world with zero hunger. On current trends, both are going to be spectacularly missed. About 600 million people will be living under the extreme poverty threshold of $2.15 a day – twice the target level envisaged under the SDGs. Unless progress is accelerated, undernutrition will be around the same in 2030 as it was in 2015. Things were looking grim even before the start of the pandemic. They look a lot bleaker now. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which hold their spring meetings in Washington this week, are well aware of the problems poor countries face. The Bank warned earlier this year of a wasted decade for low-income nations. Its president, Ajay Banga, said last week: “Many of the world’s poorest countries are facing an intense debt crisis. No one can dispute the seriousness of that.” Banga, who has been running the Bank for less than a year, wants his organisation to be faster, less bureaucratic, more effective and more efficient – all laudatory aims. More questionable is whether he can use the Bank’s power and financial clout to persuade private capital to provide the trillions of dollars needed to reduce combat and equip poor countries meet the challenge of global heating. One thing is clear: the private sector will not invest without some pump-priming by the public sector first. Poor-country governments need to spend more on schemes to boost food production, infrastructure, health, education and clean energy programmes, and they will require help from bilateral donors and multilateral organisations in order to do so. Here there is both bad and good news. The bad news is that we’ve been here before many times, with promises of new money for development made and quickly broken. When the SDGs were established it was obvious that they would not be met without financial support from bilateral and multilateral donors. The 2015 Addis Ababa action agenda was supposed to provide a blueprint for financing the SDGs, acting as a new global partnership that would be good for people and good for the planet. Sadly, but all too predictably, the commitments have not been met, and the large funding gaps help explain why targets are set to be missed. More recently the G20 was supposed to have put in place a comprehensive and speedy mechanism – the Common Framework – to relieve poor countries of their unsustainable debts. The scheme has not delivered on either count: only a handful of countries have participated and progress has been at a glacial pace. Meanwhile, the most heavily indebted countries are spending more on debt payments than they are on poverty and hunger programmes. Doubtless there will be much talk in Washington this week about the various initiatives western governments are supporting. There will be talk of how not just billions but trillions of dollars of private-sector cash is waiting out there ready to be mobilised and that all that is needed is the catalyst. But it is a time for action not words. The good news is that Banga has given the Bank a new sense of urgency. He will find a willing partner in Brazil, which holds the presidency of the G20 group of leading developed and developing nations and is pushing for collective action on poverty and hunger. A forthcoming report* prepared for Brazil by the ODI, a UK-based development thinktank, supports President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s plans for a global alliance to tackle poverty and hunger, and highlights ways that new sources of finance could be found. One idea is to make better use of the multilateral banks, and to cut down on the high transaction costs that accompany small amounts of aid. A second would link debt relief to anti-poverty programmes. Debt swaps have been used to support marine conservation in several countries, and Brazil wants to extend this approach to hunger and malnutrition. Countries would agree to spend savings granted by creditors for these specific purposes. A third idea would draw on the experience of the Just Energy Transition Partnerships – intergovernmental partnerships that coordinate financial resources and technical assistance from developed countries to help donor countries phase out fossil fuels – to create similar mechanisms for poverty and hunger. In 2021 the IMF issued £650bn of special drawing rights – a form of money creation – and divided them up between its member states. The SDRs were not needed by rich nations but would make a real difference to the financial wellbeing of poor countries. The reallocation of SDRs should be accelerated. All power to Lula. For the first time since Gordon Brown used the 2009 London summit to boost global financial firepower following the near meltdown of the banks, there is the possibility of the G20 actually delivering. He deserves support. *Financing the fight against poverty and hunger – mobilising resources for a Sustainable Development Goal reset.",Debt relief; Sustainable development goals; Global economy; Hunger; Economics; G20; World Bank; Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva; Business; Banking; International Monetary Fund (IMF); Microfinance; World news,Business
2023-09-19T16:46:08Z,Rishi Sunak missed a chance to support girls’ education at UN general assembly | Letter,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/sep/19/rishi-sunak-missed-a-chance-to-support-girls-education-at-un-general-assembly,"Rishi Sunak’s decision not to go to the UN general assembly was very shortsighted. This year’s event is more important than ever, as it is bringing together the world’s leaders to review progress towards achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs). The climate crisis, Covid, conflict and coups mean that, without a new push, the world is unlikely to achieve many of the SDGs by 2030. In some places, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, life is tougher now than when the goals were adopted eight years ago. Global cooperation is thus more urgent than ever, especially to support transformational issues such as educating girls. But getting to school can be challenging for girls, particularly in rural communities, where a staggering 1 billion people live, isolated by distance, terrain and lack of transport. It can take girls hours to walk to school, leaving them too tired to focus on their studies. Dangerous roads (or no roads) make it physically challenging, while taunting and bullying from boys make it even more difficult. An easy way to improve girls’ access to education is with a bicycle. Our studies show that when girls were given bicycles in Zambia it reduced their absenteeism by 28%, and 19% were less likely to drop out of school. Girls reported feeling more in control and confident of decisions affecting their lives. At the general assembly, Sunak would have had a chance to show his support for girls’ education and push forward global action on sustainable development, something the UK’s prime ministers have done on many occasions in the past. He should have got on his bike and gone. Staying at home won’t get him, or female students in Zambia, anywhere.

2023-11-20T17:37:04Z,UK white paper raises concerns over China’s growing foreign aid role,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/20/uk-white-paper-concerns-china-growing-foreign-aid-role,"China’s growing role in international development marks a systemic global shift that will require robust challenge by Britain if its interests are threatened, a UK government white paper on aid has warned. With David Cameron starting as foreign secretary and under scrutiny for his previous business links with China, the document does not hold back in challenging the Chinese development model or its growing influence. The drawbacks listed include “operating with lower social and environmental standards, limited transparency, allegations of corruption and capture of local elites, and limited coordination through the multilateral system, especially of bilateral instruments like the belt and road initiative”. The white paper warns “China’s growing role as an actor in international development marks a systemic shift in the global development landscape” and has wide implications for Britain’s own development policies. It says that “between 2008 and 2021, China made $498bn in loan commitments, equivalent to 83% of World Bank sovereign lending during the same period”, adding: “Its increased assertiveness in seeking to shape the international order makes it essential for us to navigate the challenges that come with its evolving development role.” The white paper promises the UK will resist the risks China “poses to open societies and good governance”, saying it will seek to influence Chinese thinking and act robustly where necessary. “Given China’s critical role in raising global development standards and achieving the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs) by 2030, it is important that China’s domestic initiatives complement multilateral efforts rather than undermine them,” the white paper said. The commentary brings into the open longstanding tensions between the Chinese model of development and Britain’s commitment in the white paper to forming partnerships and targeting low-income groups. The white paper, the brainchild of the development minister. Andrew Mitchell, contains a plethora of ambitious plans to stretch the balance sheets of multilateral banks and mobilise pension funds to direct finance to meet the currently badly offtrack SDGs. Through the greater use of guarantees it is estimated multilateral development banks could yield about $300m (£240m) to $400m of additional finance over the next decade, the white paper suggested. The World Bank estimates there is an existing total pipeline of $1.2tn for sustainable infrastructure projects in low- and middle-income countries – far short of the additional $3.9tn needed annually through to 2030 to meet the SDGs. At a global food summit in London marking the launch of the white paper, Britain’s biggest philanthropist, Sir Chris Hohn, the managing partner of the Children’s Investment Fund, announced he was giving another $50m personally to prevent and treat child wasting and believes his contribution can leverage another $500m in grants. It is estimated the hedge fund manager has given £4bn to various philanthropic schemes mainly concerned with child poverty or the climate crisis. Aid groups welcomed the plans and scale of ambition in the white paper, but almost universally criticised the government’s cuts in its own aid budget, as well as the proportion of the aid budget now diverted to domestic use.",Foreign policy; Aid; China; Politics; UK news; Society; Asia Pacific; World news,Politics
2023-11-29T23:30:32Z,Air pollution from fossil fuels ‘kills 5 million people a year’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/29/air-pollution-from-fossil-fuels-kills-5-million-people-a-year,"Air pollution from fossil fuel use is killing 5 million people worldwide every year, a death toll much higher than previously estimated, according to the largest study of its kind. The stark figures, published on the eve of the Cop28 climate summit in Dubai, will increase pressure on world leaders to take action. Among the decisions they must make at the UN conference will be whether to agree, for the first time, to gradually “phase out” fossil fuels. Research has shown that switching from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy sources would save many lives from air pollution and help combat global heating. However, until now, mortality estimates have varied widely. A new modelling study suggests air pollution, from the use of fossil fuels in industry, power generation, and transportation, accounts for 5.1 million avoidable deaths a year globally. These findings were published in The BMJ. The contribution of fossil fuels equates to 61% of a total estimated 8.3 million deaths worldwide due to outdoor air pollution from all sources in 2019. The new estimates of fossil fuel-related deaths are larger than most previously reported values, suggesting that phasing out fossil fuels might have a greater impact on attributable mortality than previously thought. “Our results suggest that a global phase-out of fossil fuels will have large health benefits, much larger than indicated by most previous studies,” the global team of researchers wrote in the BMJ. “These data support increasing the share of clean, renewable energy, advocated by the UN through the sustainable development goals for 2030 and the ambition of climate neutrality for 2050.” Ambient air pollution is the leading environmental health risk factor for illness and death, but few global studies have attributed deaths to specific air pollution sources and their results widely differ. To address this, an international team of researchers from the UK, US, Germany, Spain and Cyprus, used a new model to estimate deaths due to air pollution related to fossil fuels, and to assess potential health benefits from policies that replace fossil fuels with clean, renewable energy sources. They assessed excess deaths using data from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study, as well as Nasa satellite-based fine particulate matter and population data, and atmospheric chemistry, aerosol, and relative risk modelling for 2019. The results show that in 2019, 8.3 million deaths worldwide were attributable to fine particles (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) in ambient air, of which 61% (5.1 million) were linked to fossil fuels. “Major reductions in air pollution emissions, notably through a phase-out of fossil fuels, could have large, positive health outcomes. Results show that the mortality burden attributable to air pollution from fossil fuel use is higher than most previous estimates,” the researchers wrote. They said one reason for their model producing larger estimates than most previous studies was its being based solely on studies of outdoor air pollution. Uncertainty remained but given the Paris climate agreement’s goal of climate neutrality by 2050, “the replacement of fossil fuels by clean, renewable energy sources would have tremendous public health and climate co-benefits”.",Air pollution; Fossil fuels; Pollution; Sustainable development; Health; Industrial policy; Renewable energy; Environment; Energy; Global health; Health policy,Environment
2024-01-15T17:45:00Z,Geopolitical tensions and AI dominate start of World Economic Forum,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/15/geopolitical-tensions-and-ai-dominate-start-of-world-economic-forum,"Growing concern that heightened geopolitical tension could damage an already shaky global economy has dominated the start of the annual gathering of the world’s business and political elite in Davos, Switzerland. Three potential flash points – Ukraine, the Middle East and Taiwan – threatened to overshadow the meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) aimed at rebuilding trust after the series of setbacks suffered in the past four years, including war, the Covid-19 pandemic and the cost of living crisis. Meanwhile, a study of global business leaders to mark the start of the gathering in the Swiss mountain resort showed UK chief executives embracing generative artificial intelligence more rapidly than their peers in other countries. France’s Emmanuel Macron, Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, are all scheduled to address the WEF this week, as is Argentina’s new president Javier Milei. With Middle East tensions rising, the US is sending its secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the its national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, to Davos. Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, is also attending, as are the prime ministers of Iraq, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, and Jordan, Bisher al-Khasawneh, and Iran’s minister of foreign affairs, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian. The UK chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, and his Labour shadow, Rachel Reeves, are both speaking at this year’s event. Hunt’s predecessor, Kwasi Kwarteng, is also attending. Artificial intelligence will dominate Davos, with OpenAI’s Sam Altman due to appear on a panel. AI is seen by its proponents as a possible way of boosting growth, but the WEF said in last week’s global risks report that it could be misused by hostile states and other malign forces. Interviewed by CNBC, Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned that without measures to shape its use AI would lead to greater inequality. She said: “It’s arriving – do not close your eyes or put your head in the sand. AI requires preparation.” In its annual survey of chief executives, the accountancy firm PwC said almost half (42%) of those running UK companies had implemented the new technology in the past year, compared with 32% in other countries. The survey of 4,702 CEOs in 105 countries found the UK was one of the frontrunners in adopting the generative AI that runs chatbots such as ChatGPT and image generators such as Midjourney. Only 9% of German chief executives and 20% of French CEOs had adopted GenAI, along with 38% of US CEOs and 25% of China’s CEOs. Only Norway, (53%), Japan (50%) and Finland (49%) had been faster. Kevin Ellis, a senior partner at PwC UK, said: “After an uphill trek against economic headwinds, UK chief execs are seeking gamechanging opportunities. GenAI presents a ‘move or lose’ moment – implemented with care, it offers huge benefits for efficiency, competitiveness and ultimately profitability. “The UK’s service-based economy makes it ideally placed for the GenAI revolution – building tech is only half the battle, ensuring people and businesses can use it is key.” The PwC survey found UK chief executives upbeat about the prospects for the global economy, with 61% expecting it to improve this year – a threefold increase on the poll conducted in 2023. After almost two years in which the economy has moved sideways, UK business leaders were markedly less confident about the prospects for the UK than they were about the global economy. Only 39% expected it to improve in 2024, although PwC said this was up from 9% a year ago. At the Davos opening ceremony on Monday night, the WEF presented its annual crystal awards to architect and educator Diébédo Francis Kéré, the Oscar-winning actor Michelle Yeoh, and the musician and producer Nile Rodgers. Yeoh, star of many hit films including Tomorrow Never Dies; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; and Everything Everywhere All At Once, was recognised for her work raising awareness and mobilising support for the United Nations’ sustainable development goals, and for promoting sustainable fashion, disaster-preparedness and road safety. Kéré received the award for “his exemplary leadership” helping Burkina Faso’s Gando community create a socially, economically and ecologically sustainable future through projects that focus on education, health and the environment. The WEF also recognised Rodgers’ humanitarian work, including fighting systemic racism, inequality and injustice, championing young people, and co-founding the We Are Family Foundation to promote cultural diversity after 9/11.",Global economy; Artificial intelligence (AI); Davos; Economics; Technology; Politics; Switzerland; World news; Ukraine; Europe,Business
2022-07-19T12:41:14Z,"Urgent action needed on crucial development targets, next PM warned",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jul/19/urgent-action-needed-on-crucial-development-targets-next-pm-warned,"The next British prime minister must halt the government’s “back-sliding” in its support for crucial global development targets, NGOs have warned. A report published by Bond, the network for British development charities, said that without urgent action the UK will break its global commitments to help deliver the UN’s 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) by 2030. The goals, agreed by 193 countries in 2015, provide a blueprint to end poverty, protect the planet and address inequalities. “In 2019, the UK government promised to leave no one behind in its international development work,” said the report, published on Tuesday. “But, so far, its commitment to this transformative principle of the 2030 agenda has not translated into all of its policies, programmes and ODA [aid] spending.” It said there was a “lack of consistency” across the UK government’s international work and evidence that recent decisions made by ministers had “caused significant harm” to the poorest. The report said the UK’s decisions to cut aid during the Covid-19 pandemic and merge the “highly specialised and well-regarded” Department for International Development with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office “have undermined the UK’s position as a thought leader in international development and its power to convene countries to push for positive social change”. In 2020, Britain announced it would cut its aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% of gross national income, which translates to billions of funding being slashed. In March, the National Audit Office said the cuts were rushed through with little time to plan the impact. Bond said the cuts had “a huge impact” on programmes seeking to address gender equality. Bilateral aid programmes to address violence against women and girls were cut by 75% and there was a 70% cut for sexual and reproductive heath and rights programmes. Stephanie Draper, Bond’s chief executive, said: “The next prime minister should make the SDGs a central framework for the government so that the UK can achieve these targets by 2030. “The food and fuel insecurity caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the Covid-19 pandemic showed us how connected we all are, but they have also set back development gains. The SDGs are more needed than ever.” Danny Sriskandarajah, chief executive at Oxfam GB, which contributed to the report, said the UK played an important role in shaping the SDGs, but “it has spent recent years back-sliding on its commitments to help the poorest”. He said the government’s new aid strategy, published in May, seemed more focused “on promoting its short-term interests rather than tackling long-term global challenges”. “With climate change, conflict and Covid ravaging regions like east Africa – where someone is estimated to be dying of hunger every 48 seconds – we need a renewed focus on the most marginalised communities if we are to have any chance of achieving the goals.”","Aid; Sustainable development goals; Global development; Society; Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office; Politics; World news; UK news",Global development
2023-10-15T14:01:38Z,"UK needs to rebuild global development reputation, admits Andrew Mitchell",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/oct/15/uk-needs-to-rebuild-global-development-reputation-admits-andrew-mitchell,"Britain has to rebuild its reputation as a global leader in providing assistance to developing countries after the damage caused by the decision to slash the aid budget as part of post-pandemic spending cuts, the development minister, Andrew Mitchell, has admitted. Speaking at the annual meeting of the World Bank in Marrakech, Mitchell – who led a backbench revolt against the decision to abandon the government’s commitment to spending 0.7% of national output on aid – said it was vital that the UK “played its part”. The development minister said the UK would contribute generously to the World Bank fund that provides grants and zero-interest loans to poorer countries, would contribute to a capital increase for the Bank, and was urging that faster progress be made in giving distressed countries debt relief. “My job is to make sure we rebuild Britain’s reputation position on international development and that we play the part we have always played in driving forward the agenda,” he said. Mitchell was secretary of state at the Department for International Development (DfID) under David Cameron, but has returned to the government in a more junior role after the decision to subsume DfID into the Foreign Office. The aid cut, the siphoning off of the aid budget to pay for the housing of migrants and refugees, and the scrapping of DfID as an independent department, have all contributed to Britain losing its reputation as the world leader on development. Mitchell said that when he returned as a minister a year ago he had been told by the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, to “build back better and do what I could to help. I would argue that’s exactly what I’ve done. Whatever happened in the past, Britain is on the right track in terms of development.” As part of the aid cuts, Britain reduced its contribution to the International Development Association (IDA) – the World Bank’s grants and soft loan fund – by 50%. Ajay Banga, the Bank’s new president, used a keynote speech in Marrakech to urge rich countries to “reload” the fund, warning that it was a long way short of its goal and that time was short. Mitchell refused to be drawn on how big a contribution Britain would make to the new IDA round, but said: “I am completely across the arguments for a big replenishment and we expect to do our part.” Separately, the World Bank has been asking its major shareholders, such as the UK, to support an increase in its capital so that it can lend more to emerging and developing countries. Mitchell said Britain now backed the idea after the World Bank demonstrated a willingness to “sweat” its existing balance sheet. Mitchell said an all-party white paper due next month would set out plans to achieve the twin objectives of meeting the UN’s anti-poverty 2030 sustainable development goals and achieving a “quantum leap” in climate finance.",World Bank; Andrew Mitchell; UK news; Politics; Business; International Monetary Fund (IMF); Economics; Aid; Debt relief; Global economy,Business

He states that “our electoral law is outdated, with loopholes so large they could be seen from space”. Therein lies the real problem: our whole system was designed before anyone could look down from above. Political parties and institutions were mostly established in previous centuries. Limited reforms have been corrupted. Now, most in power adopt protectionist approaches to suit themselves rather than new needs. Why, for example, should we even still accept that it is right to pay an individual subscription to be a member of any party seeking to legislate, then argue over who is expelled if views do not absolutely coincide with current leaderships? But much can be changed. Solutions can be taken out of the grip of those with most vested interests. We have the independent Electoral Commission. Its constant tracker of public attitudes shows a majority think political funding should be reformed and regulated. That will sadly not happen in this turbulent pre-election year. But 2030 would be a good target, coinciding with UN sustainable development goals, for the Electoral Commission to bring forward root and branch reforms of the way we run our political system, considering the best 21st-century global examples and thinking.

In a snapshot report, published on Thursday, the agency said the world was failing women and girls and was “way off track” to meet the 2030 deadline for gender targets set in the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs), which were agreed by UN member states in 2015. Tangible progress is prevented by “deeply rooted biases against women, manifesting in unequal access to sexual and reproductive health, unequal political representation, economic disparities and a lack of legal protection”, it said. Of the 120 countries where data is available, 67 don’t have laws that prohibit discrimination against women and 28 are yet to implement laws granting women equal rights in marriage and divorce. Only 41 countries are deemed to have met, almost met or be close to meeting their targets on gender equality. Progress to end maternal deaths has stalled since 2015, while one in five women are married before they turn 18. No country is close to eradicating domestic violence. Each year, 245 million women and girls over the age of 15 will experience physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner. Women hold only 26.7% of seats in parliaments around the world. Unless the pace of change increases, by 2050 women will still spend more than 9% more time or 2.3 more hours a day on unpaid care work than men. They will also hold only about 30% of management positions. “That’s shocking,” said Ginette Azcona, the lead author of the report. “When we look at the current state of affairs in terms of gender equality around the world, we are seeing that progress has not been fast enough, and it’s been uneven across countries. “It’s been a lacklustre commitment to gender equality that we need to change and we need to change it now. And there is a price tag if we are serious about gender equality. And when you look at the data, what we find is that the resources going to gender equality programming are very low, but they are also erratic, they’re not sustained over time.” The report comes ahead of a high-profile summit to assess progress towards the SDGs, on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York this month. The SDGs aim to address the global challenges of poverty, inequality, the climate crisis, peace and justice. The meeting will herald what the UN says will be “the beginning of a new phase of accelerated progress towards the SDGs”.",Women's rights and gender equality; Sustainable development goals; Global development; Gender; World news; United Nations,Global development
2023-10-04T10:00:40Z,Central banks ‘risk global recession unless they relax 2% inflation targets’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/oct/04/central-banks-risk-global-recession-unless-they-relax-inflation-targets,"Central banks risk tipping a stalling global economy into a full-blown recession unless they relax their 2% inflation targets and adopt a more pro-growth stance, the economic arm of the UN has warned. Pointing to evidence of a looming debt crisis in poor countries, the UN said the sharp rises in interest rates from the major central banks since 2021 had increased inequality and reduced investment but proved a blunt anti-inflation weapon. The annual report from the Geneva-based UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) said global growth was set to slow from 3% in 2022 to 2.4% in 2023, with little sign of a rebound next year. Richard Kozul-Wright, the director of Unctad’s globalisation and development strategies division, said: “The global economy is stalling, with Europe teetering on the edge of recession, China facing strong headwinds and financial stresses are reappearing in the United States. “At this moment, pushing down on the fiscal brakes and keeping interest rates high is the wrong policy combination for steadying the global economy.” Unctad said the global economy was “at a crossroads” and poorer countries were being disproportionately hurt by the higher interest rates in advanced countries such as the US. A widening wealth gap threatened to undermine the fragile economic recovery and the aspirations of developing nations to meet the UN’s sustainable development goals. “Debt burdens, the silent weight on many developing countries, remain a major concern,” the 2023 trade and development report said. “Rising interest rates, weakening currencies and sluggish export growth have combined to squeeze the fiscal space for essential needs, transforming the growing debt service burden into an unfolding development crisis.” Warning that almost a third of low- or lower-middle income “frontier economies” were on the precipice of debt distress, the UN body said addressing the issue was paramount since meeting the demands of their creditors was “crushing too many developing countries”. Inflation had come down from its highs in late 2022 but its descent had been uneven and was caused largely by the easing of supply-side pressures, Unctad said, adding that the recent rise in oil prices would add to cost of living concerns at a time when insufficient wage growth was squeezing household budgets. “Tighter monetary policy has so far contributed little to price easing and at a steep cost in terms of inequality and damaged investment prospects,” Unctad said. “Central bankers should relax their 2% inflation target and assume a wider stabilising role.” The report said reducing inequality should be a policy priority in developed and developing countries, with a close watch kept on the share of national income going to workers. It said real – inflation-adjusted – wages should increase in line with productivity growth, with concrete commitments toward comprehensive social protection. Unctad’s secretary general, Rebeca Grynspan, said: “To safeguard the world economy from future systemic crises, we must avoid the policy mistakes of the past and embrace a positive reform agenda. “We need a balanced policy mix of fiscal, monetary and supply-side measures to achieve financial sustainability, boost productive investment and create better jobs. Regulation needs to address the deepening asymmetries of the international trading and financial system.”",Global economy; Inflation; Unctad; Business; Economics; United Nations; World news; Banking; Interest rates; Inequality,Business
2024-01-23T10:00:44Z,"Cookstove carbon offsets overstate climate benefit by 1,000%, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/23/clean-cookstove-carbon-offsets-overstate-climate-benefit-by-1000-percent,"Clean cookstove projects, one of the most popular types of carbon-offset schemes, are probably overstating their beneficial impact on the climate by an average of 1,000%, according to a new study. Every year, an estimated 3.2 million people die prematurely from household air pollution caused by cooking with smoky fuels such as wood, paraffin or kerosene, which produce about 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Such cooking also drives deforestation and habitat loss, as people cut down trees for fuel. By switching from smoky fuels to cleaner alternatives such as electric cookers, cookstove projects in the developing world can have major health, social and environmental benefits: improving air quality, reducing the amount of time people spend collecting wood and slowing the loss of the world’s forests. To fund these initiatives, which are often dubbed “nature-based-solutions”, projects sell on the greenhouse gas reductions as carbon credits. Each credit represents a tonne of carbon dioxide – which companies then use to “offset” their emissions, sometimes claiming their products and services are “carbon neutral”. Improving access to clean cooking facilities features in the UN sustainable development goals, and cookstove-based credits have been on the rise. From May to November last year, figures from the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project show cookstove projects issued the most new credits in the market, comprising about 15% of the total. They also registered the most new projects. But a new study published in the journal Nature Sustainability has found that cookstove projects that generate carbon offsets are overstating their climate benefits by 1,000% on average. The findings have been disputed by Verra and Gold Standard, both leading certifiers of carbon credits, which say the evidence in the study does not back the conclusions drawn. While many offsetting schemes said they were funding “clean” cookstoves, most did not meet World Health Organization standards, according to the assessment by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. Analysis of common rules to produce the offsets found that projects were allowed to overstate how often people used the stoves and the resulting benefits for nearby forests, dramatically inflating the benefit to the climate and biodiversity, researchers said. The findings draw on previous research on the impact of cookstove schemes by development economists, who found they often failed to produce their potential benefits in practice. Despite the problems, the researchers said the rules on producing carbon credits could be reformed to provide a meaningful source of climate finance that companies could trust. They offer a method that clean cookstove projects can use to avoid overstating their impact, which some of the cookstove companies have already adopted while the paper has been in peer-review. The lead author, Annelise Gill-Wiehl, a PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley, said: “Comprehensively assessing the five major cookstove offset methodologies, we find that our sample of 40% of the market is 9.2 times over-credited. Extrapolating to the entire market, we find roughly 10 times over-crediting. “Over-crediting replaces direct emission reduction and other more effective climate mitigation activities, even if some reduction is achieved. Lack of trust weakens the market,” she said. The study comes amid intense scrutiny of the unregulated voluntary carbon market, with concerns that many schemes are producing huge amounts of worthless carbon offsets. Barbara Haya, director of the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project, who has been researching carbon credits for 20 years and is co-author of the study, said researchers hoped the quality of credits could be improved. “A carbon credit market built on exaggerations is destined to fail. Our hope is that the specific recommendations we offer can help make clean cookstoves a trusted source of quality carbon credits,” she said. Gold Standard, a major carbon credit certifier, disputed the findings of the study. The researchers found that Gold Standard produced the best-quality method for producing offsets, which directly monitored use of stoves, and was only 1.5 times over-credited. “Gold Standard welcomes academic scrutiny and has engaged extensively with the authors of this study,” a spokesperson said, adding that it had already incorporated some of the ideas and changes discussed in the research. “It must be stressed that the study neither studied, nor found, over-estimation. The evidence provided does not back the conclusions drawn – which are at odds with the wider academic literature and expert view on this subject.” In a statement, Verra, the world’s largest carbon standard, said it was disappointed to see continued attention on the study. The non-profit organisation is developing a new methodology for cookstoves, and said the findings did not directly relate to its current methods. “As detailed in a September 2023 open letter from researchers and experts, there are numerous substantive concerns about this research,” it said. Verra said the proposed methodology it was developing included changes that “reflect current best practices of project design and implementation”, as well as a number of measuring techniques to check how much the stoves were being used. “Carbon finance is critical for the implementation/sustenance of improved cookstove projects, which provide access to sophisticated cooking methods and a range of other sustainable development benefits to disadvantaged communities,” it said. Ben Jeffreys, chief executive of the cookstove company ATEC, which is working with UC Berkeley to measure the benefits more accurately, said he supported the research. “Ensuring ‘a tonne of emission reductions is actually a tonne’ is critical if we are to reach the full potential of the cookstove carbon-market sector,” he said.

2023-10-11T12:56:15Z,"Severe debt burdens thwarting progress on climate and poverty, says World Bank",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/oct/11/severe-debt-burdens-thwarting-progress-on-climate-and-poverty-says-world-bank,"Reducing poverty and hitting global net zero goals are being hindered by the severe debt burdens on poor countries, the president of the World Bank has said, amid growing concern that high interest rates could cause dozens of countries to default. Ajay Banga, the new head of the Washington-based body, urged faster progress in providing debt relief but said there was no “magic wand” that could be waved to make the problem go away, at a press conference at the Bank’s annual meeting in Marrakech. Indermit Gill, the World Bank’s chief economist, said the last time the Federal Reserve had raised interest rates as aggressively as it had recently was more than 40 years ago, and the result was that 24 countries went bankrupt. Their comments came as the US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, said she planned to meet the head of China’s central bank, Pan Gongsheng, for talks that would include possible closer cooperation on debt. Relations between Washington and Beijing are frosty but, amid growing pressures on indebted countries as a result of higher global interest rates, Yellen said more help was needed. China has become one of the world’s leading creditor nations and its support is needed if countries are to receive help through the common framework – a debt relief mechanism set up by the G20 group of leading developed and developing nations in 2020 but which has been criticised for slowness and offering little tangible help. Yellen said: “Though progress has been slow and certainly needs to be improved … we have seen some meaningful progress. I’m hopeful more progress can be made.” A report from Debt Service Watch, a coalition of debt campaign groups, said the outlook for developing countries was worse than during the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s and during the two rounds of multilateral debt relief in the late 90s and mid-2000s. Debt service was absorbing 54% of budget revenue and 40% of public spending in Africa, the report said. Spread across all continents, 35 countries were paying more than half of their revenue servicing their debts, and 54 over one-third. The figures were more than twice the levels faced by low-income countries before the heavily indebted poor country initiative of the 1990s and the multilateral debt relief initiative of 2005; and slightly higher than those paid by Latin American countries in the 80s. According to the Debt Service Watch report the five countries with the highest debt servicing costs as a share of revenue are Egypt, on 196%, Sierra Leone (169%), The Gambia (165%), São Tomé and Príncipe (137%) and Malawi (133%). Four countries – Chad, Zambia, Ethiopia and Ghana – have applied for debt relief through the common framework. Debt payments were crowding out spending to confront social and environmental crises. Debt service was 50% higher than combined spending in African countries on education, health, social protection and climate. “Developing countries need another major round of debt cancellation”, the report said. Current debt relief deals were failing to provide poor countries with the scope to spend more on achieving the UN 2030 sustainable development goals, with the latest restructuring deals leaving debt service at an average 48% of revenue over the next three to five years. “The international community must take urgent steps to reduce debt service much more sharply, through enhanced debt relief and reduced borrowing costs,” the report said. Matthew Martin, the director of Development Finance International, said: “This is a silent crisis. Countries might not yet be defaulting but millions if not billions are suffering every day. People are not prepared to do anything about it but they have to deal with it. If they don’t there will be more migration and more instability.” Banga said that if the common framework were to be replaced there needed to be a “good idea” of what would take its place. “I wish there was a magic wand and I could say abracadabra but I don’t think there is.”",World Bank; Debt relief; Inequality; Climate finance; Climate crisis; Global economy; World news; Business; Economics; Global development; Environment,Business
2023-12-20T13:09:52Z,‘People are proud of this green spirit of ours’: how a small Spanish city rejected cars,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/20/vitoria-gasteiz-spanish-city-rejected-cars,"They call it the anillo verde, the green ring, a 30km (19 mile) series of parks and cycle lanes that encircle Vitoria-Gasteiz, the capital of the Basque region in northern Spain. Broad, tranquil avenues of tall trees link parks, squares and allotments, forming a circular oasis around a city centre that itself is largely car-free and where, aside from a passing tram, the dominant sound is conversation, birdsong and even the persistent chirping of cicadas. It is the sort of zone that cities around the world are increasingly investing in – but Vitoria-Gasteiz began this process decades ago. As a result this small Spanish city is a global leader in urban green policy. As postwar Spain transitioned from being a rural to a largely urban society, the city’s population quintupled from 52,000 in 1950 to 253,000 today, with an increase in car use to match. But the city governors were very worried about the rising number of vehicles. While many other cities around Europe were embracing cars in the 1970s, and in many cases building bigger roads and more capacity, they took the then fairly radical decision to buck the trend by starting to pedestrianise the city centre. They also created Spain’s first network of cycle paths, which now extends to 180km, one of the most extensive in the country. Plans to create the now famous green ring were first mooted in the 1980s and work began in the early 1990s. This included a community-based project to plant 250,000 trees. Now no one is more than a few minutes’ walk from green space and the city boasts 50 sq metres of green space per inhabitant, compared with 31 in London and 17 in Barcelona. In 2012 the city was named the 2012 European Green Capital by the European Commission. “We’re a city where people are keen on cycling and like to go walking in the hills and much of the impetus for making Vitoria a green city has come from its citizens,” says Borja Rodríguez Ramajo, the city’s head of environmental policy. Since 2006 the city has also been creating “superblocks” similar to those in Barcelona, sections of the city closed to through traffic. Altogether, these measures have increased the city’s pedestrian areas from 31 to 71%. Inevitably, some of these measures have been met with opposition, says Rodríguez, who argues it takes courage to implement sustainable policies. “We’ve always sought the involvement of environmental groups and residents’ associations in these initiatives,” he says. “I think people here are proud of this green spirit of ours.” And so they are, but many residents claim the consultative process looks better on paper than it is in practice. “From the start the city council had two types of meetings between the public and private sectors,” says José Luis Azkarate, president of the residents’ association in the city’s Ensanche district. “One dealt with specific issues such as mobility and another on the impact on neighbourhoods. We don’t think these meetings worked well because there wasn’t a plan and everything was too improvised.” “Sometimes the city proposes big projects in which residents don’t feel very involved or don’t bother to participate,” says fellow resident Rosa Murguía Quincoces. Julia Neidig, a researcher at the Basque Centre for Climate Change who has spent “the past four years looking at the contradictions, challenges and dilemmas that arose from Vitoria-Gasteiz being the green capital”, says that while nearly everyone is proud of the green city, there is criticism about the greening process. “A green city is something where people are in the process of creating that city and includes other notions than the green aspect, such as community, and integrating citizens into how projects are developed,” Neidig says, adding that many residents feel that meetings between the city and its citizens are “more informative than involving”. With greening comes gentrification and in working-class areas this can lead to the displacement of the original inhabitants as property prices rise. However, the relative lack of tourism and digital nomads in Vitoria-Gasteiz has minimised this impact compared with cities such as Málaga and Barcelona. “The greening agenda needs to be bold and quick to be effectively realised, which is what European cities are good at,” says Isabelle Anguelovski, a research professor at the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies and director of the Barcelona Lab for Urban Environmental Justice and Sustainability. “It’s also because the cities are dense and we don’t rely on cars, unlike American cities.” However, she says that issues of “green injustice” are not on the European agenda in the way they are in the United States. “In Europe we don’t think about social justice or racial justice the way progressive American cities do,” says Anguelovski. “We don’t have a strong racial environmental justice movement here in Europe.” In 2019, the UN awarded Vitoria-Gasteiz the title of Global Green City for its efforts in achieving the Agenda 2030 sustainable development goals. However, not content to rest on its green laurels, the Basque capital is now helping to coordinate the NetZeroCities project, a network of 53 cities in 21 European countries which, Rodríguez says, “aims to create a total of 112 intelligent and climate-neutral cities by 2030”.",Access to green space; Spain; Europe; Environment; World news; Road transport,Environment
2024-07-02T09:45:34Z,From conflict to the climate – what are the UK parties’ international plans?,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jul/02/conflicts-climate-uk-parties-international-plans-election,"Conflicts and environmental disasters are stretching humanitarian resources, and a new UK government will have to decide what role it will play on the world stage in dealing with global problems, especially after budget cuts and closure of the Department for International Development by the Conservatives, and with priorities so focused on Ukraine. We’ve talked to the main parties and looked at their manifestos to see what their plans are. Sudan The war and resultant humanitarian crisis that has ravaged Sudan since April 2023 has become the world’s largest emergency, with famine already taking hold. The advance of the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group on the city of El Fasher in Darfur has once again raised alarm about a potential genocide. But most of the parties make no mention of Sudan at all in their manifestos, while pledging to stand by Ukraine and referencing Israel and Palestine. Conservatives The current government has been concerned about the situation in Darfur and Sudan as a whole, tabling a resolution at the UN security council in June to call for an end to the RSF’s siege of El Fasher. The party’s manifesto mentions Sudan as among several conflicts where it will “redouble our efforts” for a diplomatic breakthrough. “It’s an enormous worry and it’s occupying a great deal of time. Ukraine and Gaza mean the focus on the world is elsewhere and we need to correct that,” said Andrew Mitchell, the deputy foreign secretary. Labour The shadow Africa minister, Lyn Brown, has been pushing for more pressure on the warring parties to improve humanitarian access and to agree a ceasefire. A Labour spokesperson said: “The UK has a leadership role on Sudan in the United Nations security council. Labour will support stronger and more coordinated international efforts for an immediate ceasefire, protection of civilians, accountability for violations of international law, and the restoration of peaceful civilian governance.” Liberal Democrats Layla Moran, the party’s spokesperson for foreign affairs, said the Liberal Democrats would increase humanitarian assistance to Sudan and have a greater role in pursuing a “long-term peace where civilians form a democratic government and war crimes are prosecuted”. Green party “The situation in Sudan is appalling. We would work within the UN and leverage the UK’s privileged role as a member of the UN security council to push for peace, and uphold human rights and international law,” a Green party spokesperson said. The Scottish National party, Plaid Cymru and Reform UK did not mention Sudan in their manifestos and did not offer comment to the Guardian global development team on plans to lobby on the conflict and humanitarian crisis. What the experts say Sudanese activists in the country and abroad have been crying out for more support for their cause. With more than 7 million people internally displaced, Sudan is in the world’s largest internal displacement crisis. There has been a lack of momentum towards a ceasefire, despite several rounds of talks, and the fall of Darfur to the RSF has left the country more fractured. There needs to be a bigger push towards a ceasefire and for humanitarian access but also to ensure farmers can produce food. Sudan is entering a rainy season that is projected to be heavier and possibly last longer than usual, raising concerns about damage to agriculture and the spread of disease. In the UK, Sudanese diaspora activists have talked about a lack of support for some of those evacuated by the UK in the early stages of the war, especially the dependents of British citizens who have not been given any clear legal status and, unlike Ukrainians, have no pathway for staying in the country. Development spending Conservatives In November 2020, Rishi Sunak, then chancellor of the exchequer, announced he was breaking a manifesto promise by cutting the overseas aid budget by a third and ending the Conservative party commitment to the UN’s recommended spend of 0.7% of gross national income on aid. Mitchell fought against the government’s decision. “I would like it brought back as soon as possible,” he said. “But the position is that it will return when the two fiscal tests [not borrowing to finance day-to-day spending and underlying debt is falling] are satisfied.” The party is promising to introduce a “strict national interest test” for all future international development spending. Labour The manifesto commits to return to 0.7% “as soon as fiscal circumstances allow”. Labour has not clarified exactly what the criteria and timelines are for this, or whether these might differ from the Conservatives’ commitments. Liberal Democrats The cut to development spending was “misguided”, according to Moran, and “has tied our hands when it comes to responding to civilian conflict, famine and other humanitarian crises around the world”. The party would restore the UK’s international development spending to 0.7% of national income and re-establish an independent Department for International Development. Green party The Greens would restore international aid to 0.7% of global national income, raising this to 1% by 2033. The party would also increase the climate finance budget to 1.5% of global national income by 2033, with an additional contribution to a newly established loss and damage fund. Scottish National party The SNP has promised to immediately restore the UK international aid budget to 0.7%. Chris Law, a member of the international development committee, said that should be the minimum requirement for all parties. “If we are going to be serious about our place in the world, we need to return to 0.7% as soon as possible … I’ve said before that I would like to raise it to 1% for an independent Scotland.” The party also promises to increase investment into loss and damage caused by the climate crisis. Plaid Cymru The party supports “the UN target for countries to spend 0.7% on international aid and calls on the next UK government to reinstate that commitment as a matter of urgency”. Reform UK In its manifesto, Reform UK has called for cuts of 50% to international development spending and states a “major review is needed into the effectiveness of overseas aid”. It also calls for a review of the “global quangos” to which the UK pays more than £7bn a year. Bond, the UK network for organisations working in international development, said this “presumably refers to multilateral development spending through bodies such as the Global Fund”, which invests more than $5bn (£3.9bn) a year to fight HIV, TB and malaria. What the experts say When it was announced in 2020, charities, aid experts and MPs decried the slash in funding, labelling it “unprincipled, unjustified and harmful”. The cut left a £4.6bn black hole in the budget compared to 2019, leading to many programme closures in 2021, including in key areas such as health and humanitarian work. Last year, the government admitted that thousands of lives would be lost as a result of ongoing cuts. In January, an international development committee report found the cut had a devastating impact on women and girls, damaging the UK’s reputation as a credible and serious partner in advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights globally. Biggest international development challenges Conservatives If the Conservatives form the next government, their manifesto states that their international development white paper would continue to inform their overall international development priorities. Mitchell said: “[The white paper] is about getting the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) back on track, the fight against climate change and turning climate funding from billions into trillions.” Mitchell said he was most worried about Africa and added that more money is needed for adaptation to the impact of the climate crisis, especially in poorer countries on the continent. Labour The party blames the Conservatives for undoing Britain’s “world-leading” reputation in the international development sector but plans to immediately order a review of how the UK can rebuild its capacity and leadership in development to work towards a poverty-free world. “With multiple crises around the world demanding our immediate attention, and years of Tory chaos to overturn, we have no time to waste,” said Lisa Nandy, the shadow cabinet minister for international development, in a letter after the manifesto’s release. Liberal Democrats “As we tackle the enormous development challenges facing the world, from insecurity and conflict to the growing impact of the climate crisis, it is vital that the UK’s place on the world stage as a development superpower is restored,” said Moran. The party’s manifesto includes pledges on increasing humanitarian assistance to Sudan, on official and immediate recognition of a Palestinian state, and a foreign policy agenda “with gender equality at its heart”. Green party Climate is the number one foreign development challenge, according to a party spokesperson. “We need to support and work with low and middle-income countries to face the challenge of our heating planet,” they said. The party outlines the importance of upholding international law regarding the conflict in Gaza and the West Bank. “The UK’s diplomatic isolation over Gaza does not give us a strong voice to tackle climate,” said the spokesperson. The Greens are focused on Gaza, Sudan, Myanmar and Ukraine and say all conflicts should be dealt with in the same way, without discrimination. Scottish National party According to Law, the climate crisis and conflict are the two biggest challenges any government is facing in terms of international development and humanitarian aid. He singled out the situation in Gaza as of particular concern. “Gaza is clearly on the horizon in terms of needing immediate support,” he said. As aid continued to be blocked from entering Gaza, it appeared to many people that starvation was being inflicted on people by Israel, he said. “It’s really serious. Getting more humanitarian aid into Gaza would be a top priority.” Plaid Cymru The party did not respond to the Guardian but its manifesto calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and supports statehood for Palestine. It “supports peaceful and negotiated outcomes to all conflict”. Reform UK The party’s manifesto makes no mention of international development challenges and no spokesperson responded to the Guardian’s request for comment. What the experts say The next government faces several conflicts that are splitting humanitarian and diplomatic resources. Those in Gaza and Ukraine continue to demand attention but fighting and displacement continues in Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Haiti. Record numbers are internally displaced and the problem is not only new conflicts but the lack of solutions to old ones that mean people are not able to return to their normal lives. While aid agencies clamour for more money to fund their responses to all of these crises, they will simply drag on without actual solutions.",Global development; Foreign policy; Labour; Conservatives; Liberal Democrats; Green party; Scottish National party (SNP); Plaid Cymru; Reform UK; Sudan; Africa; Ukraine; Europe; Politics; Scottish politics; UK news; World news; Middle East and north Africa; Scotland; The future of development,Global development
2023-09-17T05:00:51Z,"Increase benefits by inflation, top Tory urges Rishi Sunak ",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/sep/17/increase-benefits-by-inflation-top-tory-urges-rishi-sunak,"A senior Conservative has called on his party to ensure welfare claimants are not handed a real-terms cut next year, after Rishi Sunak refused to commit to increasing benefits in line with inflation. Andy Street, the West Midlands mayor and the most senior Tory outside London, said the party’s previous commitment to increasing benefits such as universal credit in line with inflation had become a “real symbol” of the party’s commitment to helping the low-paid. Concerns over the policy have emerged since it was claimed that the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, was considering a below-inflation increase in benefits as he struggles with tight public finances and Tory demands for tax cuts before the next general election. Sunak then refused to rule out a below-inflation rise during his recent trip to India. Benefits are usually increased every April in line with the inflation rate from the previous September. That would mean an increase of about 7%. With inflation expected to be much lower in the spring, Hunt could then argue that a 7% rise would be too high. Street, who has emerged as a leading voice on the party’s liberal wing, called on Hunt and Sunak to increase benefits in line with inflation, as they did this year. “I don’t think the prime minister vacillated on it for one second,” said Street. “It seemed very clear, the decision to upgrade it by inflation was really important. And we will face that decision again, and I’m absolutely clear – that has to happen again, because that’s a real symbol. “There is absolutely no question that there is a big chunk of people in this city [Birmingham] who are really hurting with the cost of living crisis at the moment, I’m not questioning that in any way. All of the national issues play out here, probably even more pronounced, from fuel poverty to declining real wages.” The Department for Work and Pensions has previously said the government has increased benefits by more than 10% this year “to protect the most vulnerable from the impact of high inflation”. Hunt is likely to announce his decision over the uprating of benefits in the autumn statement, which he is due to give on 23 November. It comes as analysis suggests that the government is far off course to halve UK poverty by 2030, a commitment it made as part of the UN’s sustainable development goals in 2015. The foreign secretary, James Cleverly, will discuss the goals at a summit this week. Research by Adam Corlett, the principal economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, found that absolute poverty declined between 2015-16 and 2020-21, from 20% to 17%. Poverty has since been edging upwards as a result of the energy price shock, the removal of temporary pandemic support, ongoing welfare cuts, rising housing costs and the overall weak economic conditions. Absolute poverty is projected by Corlett to be higher in 2029-30 than in 2020-21. The poverty rate for children is currently projected to increase slightly from 27% to 28% of children. “Changes in economic forecasts for the second half of this decade could easily alter this long-term, uncertain outlook; as could major policy changes,” said Corlett. “But at present, the UK is nowhere near on track to meet its poverty reduction commitment, or even put in a creditable performance, and with each passing year the speed of change that would be required to meet the target increases.”",Benefits; Society; Jeremy Hunt; Rishi Sunak; Conservatives; Economic policy; Politics; Birmingham; UK news,Society
2023-10-17T15:32:08Z,Definitions changing in UK’s bid to meet climate finance target,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/17/definitions-changing-in-uks-bid-to-meet-climate-finance-target,"The UK is making a series of changes to its climate finance definitions as a way to meet its target to spend £11.6bn over five years in the developing world to help combat the climate crisis, Andrew Mitchell, the development minister, has said. Rich countries have long promised to provide finance – in the form of loans or cash – to help poor countries cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of the climate crisis. However, leaks in the summer showed UK ministers were warned they were massively off track to meet their targets and could only do so by raiding the aid budget. Boris Johnson’s government, with Rishi Sunak as chancellor, committed in 2019 to ramping up its international climate finance (ICF) in order to reach a target of £11.6bn between the financial years 2021-22 and 2025-26. Mitchell, in a Guardian interview, said recent changes involved three new assumptions that would help the UK meet that target. First, in the allocation of humanitarian spending in the 10% of the poorest countries, the UK will in future assume 30% was spent on internal climate finance, without making a precise calculation. Describing the move as good housekeeping, Mitchell said this was in line with practice in other major countries delivering aid. Second, the UK will no longer assume only 30% of spending by the UK aid investment arm, British International Investment (BII), goes on climate finance, which could be much higher. Third, for the first time the UK will also include UK aid spending on climate sent to multilateral development banks as part of the £11.6bn spend. Mitchell defended himself from the charge of a “sleight of hand” by describing the changes as “clarifications and not definitional changes. We will now more accurately reflect what we spend on climate.” He pointed out that other countries, unlike the UK, included climate-related loans to developing countries as part of their climate finance budget. The UK was also not including dividends from the BII’s investment in climate-related projects. If included – something the government did not intend to do – this would have been worth £750m over two years, he said. Similarly, none of the $5.8bn (£4.77bn) of guarantees provided to the Africa Development Bank, World Bank and Asia Development Bank that he said would release $3.2bn (£2.63bn) of climate finance in the time period in question, would be allocated to meeting the target. Mitchell said if all this spending was defined as climate-related by the UK, the total UK international climate finance budget would be closer to £16bn. The new changes will have to be reported to the DAC, the international development watchdog in Paris, but officials expect there to be no pushback since none of the changes breach DAC definitions. The redefined £11.6bn will be included as part of the pledge by developed countries to direct at least $100bn a year of climate finance to the developing world from 2020, a commitment first made at the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, which has still not been met. Officials claim the UK is coming into line with other countries’ more liberal definitions of what constitutes climate finance. Responding to the government statement, Sophie Powell, Christian Aid’s chief of advocacy and policy, said it looked “like an exercise in double counting”. She said: “As Cop28 nears, where the UK used to lead on climate, it is now lowering the bar at every turn, which is a disaster for the world’s most vulnerable people.” Mitchell promised that the white paper would show how the UK would contribute to the world getting back on track to meeting the UN sustainable development goals. He claimed there was more flexibility in the aid budget due to a tightening in the amount of official development assistance being spent on housing first-year asylum seekers in the UK. A leak to the Guardian in July suggested officials had in effect been advising ministers to drop the £11.6bn target. Government officials had calculated the leak showed that it would have to spend 83% of the Foreign Office’s official development assistance budget on the international climate fund. Civil servants said in the leaked document that this “would squeeze out room for other commitments such as humanitarian and women and girls”.","Politics; Climate finance; Climate crisis; Climate aid; Andrew Mitchell; Aid; UK news; Humanitarian response; Sustainable development goals; Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office",Politics
2023-10-10T06:00:33Z,Downing Street trying to agree statement about AI risks with world leaders,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/10/downing-street-trying-to-agree-statement-about-ai-risks-with-world-leaders,"Rishi Sunak’s advisers are trying to thrash out an agreement among world leaders on a statement warning about the risks of artificial intelligence as they finalise the agenda for the AI safety summit next month. Downing Street officials have been touring the world talking to their counterparts from China to the EU and the US as they work to agree on words to be used in a communique at the two-day conference. But they are unlikely to agree a new international organisation to scrutinise cutting-edge AI, despite interest from the UK in giving the government’s AI taskforce a global role. Sunak’s AI summit will produce a communique on the risks of AI models, provide an update on White House-brokered safety guidelines and end with “like-minded” countries debating how national security agencies can scrutinise the most dangerous versions of the technology. The possibility of some form of international cooperation on cutting-edge AI that can pose a threat to human life will also be discussed on the final day of the summit on 1 and 2 November at Bletchley Park, according to a draft agenda seen by the Guardian. The draft refers to establishing an “AI Safety Institute” to enable the national security-related scrutiny of frontier AI models – the term for the most advanced versions of the technology. However, last week the prime minister’s summit representative downplayed the establishment of such an organisation, although he emphasised that “collaboration is key” in managing frontier AI risks. In a post last week on X, formerly known as Twitter, Matt Clifford wrote: “It’s not about setting up a single new international institution. Our view is that most countries will want to develop their own capabilities in this space, particularly to evaluate frontier models.” The UK is leading the way in the frontier AI process so far, having established a frontier AI taskforce under the tech entrepreneur Ian Hogarth. The deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, said last month he hoped the taskforce “can evolve to become a permanent institutional structure, with an international offer on AI safety”. Clifford announced last week that about 100 people would attend the summit, drawn from cabinet ministers around the world, company chief executives, academics and representatives from international civil society. According to the draft agenda, the summit includes a three-track discussion on day one based on a discussion of risks associated with frontier models, a discussion of mitigating those risks, and discussing opportunities from those models. This would be followed by short communique to be signed by country delegations that expresses a consensus on the risks and opportunities of frontier models. Companies participating in the summit, which are expected to include ChatGPT developer OpenAI, Google and Microsoft, will then publish details about how they are adhering to AI safety commitments agreed with the White House in July. Those commitments include external security testing of AI models before they are released and ongoing scrutiny of those systems once they are operating. According to a report in Politico last week, the White House is updating the voluntary commitments – with reference to safety, cybersecurity and how AI systems could be used for national security purposes – and could make an announcement this month. The second day will feature a smaller gathering of about 20 people including “like-minded” countries, according to the draft agenda, with a conversation about where AI could be in five years’ time and positive AI opportunities linked to sustainable development goals. This included a discussion about a safety institute. In his thread on X, Clifford said the UK remained keen on collaborating with other countries on AI safety. “Collaboration is key to ensuring we can manage risks from Frontier AI – with civil society, academics, technical experts and other countries,” he wrote. A government spokesperson said: “We have been very clear that these discussions will involve exploring areas for potential collaboration on AI safety research, including evaluation and standards. “International discussions on this work are already under way and are making good progress, including discussing how we can collaborate across countries and firms and with technical experts to evaluate frontier models. There are many different ways to do this and we look forward to convening this conversation in November at the summit.”",Artificial intelligence (AI); Technology; UK news,Technology
2023-10-20T09:37:37Z,"Half of children in poorer countries have lead poisoning, says study",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/oct/20/half-of-children-in-poorer-countries-have-lead-poisoning-says-study-acc,"Urgent action is needed to address the “staggering harm” caused by lead poisoning, mostly in low-income countries where more than half of children are exposed to dangerous levels of the pollutant. A year-long project, led by Washington-based thinktank the Center for Global Development (CGD), has concluded that lead poisoning constitutes a global health crisis that has been “extraordinarily neglected” by donors and political leaders. An estimated 815 million children – one in three worldwide – have lead poisoning, a condition linked to heart and kidney disorders, impaired intelligence, violent behaviour and premature death. Last month, a paper in Lancet Planetary Health estimated that, in 2019, 5.5 million people died because of cardiovascular disease caused by lead poisoning, about three times the number killed by lung cancer. The World Bank calculates the cost of premature deaths to be equivalent to $4.6tn, or 5.3% of global GDP. The effects of lead poisoning are also a significant barrier to achieving almost all of the UN’s sustainable development goals, the report says. Children are most vulnerable to the condition because they’re more likely to put lead items in their mouths (for instance, toys covered in lead paint), and because their bones and organs absorb more of the metal once consumed. Additionally, lead, which is a neurotoxin, can more easily cross the blood-brain barrier at younger ages, where it can severely affect mental development. In July, a working paper published by the CGD aggregated 47 studies to show that the more lead children are exposed to, the lower their test scores in maths, reading and IQ. The CGD found that about a fifth of the total gap in test scores between children in rich and poor countries is attributable to differences in lead exposure. Strict laws and billions of dollars in addressing the causes of poisoning prevent most children in wealthy countries from coming into contact with significant amounts of lead. That is not the case in poorer nations, where the metal continues to be used in commercial products such as paint (which can chip and create dust that people breathe in), traditional medicines and spices, as well as cookware glazed in lead, which can leach into food. The failure to create buffer zones between mining waste facilities and residential areas also contributes to soil and air contamination in poor countries, as does the absence of well-enforced safety and environmental standards for lead-acid battery recyclers. As a result, it is estimated that more than half of all children in low-income countries have lead poisoning – the figure is just 3% in rich nations. During the height of the water crisis in Flint, in the US state of Michigan, where lead was found in drinking water, less than 4% of Flint’s children were clinically poisoned. An estimated $350m in targeted aid from 2024 to 2030 would be enough to dramatically reduce lead exposure in lower-income countries, provided there is enough engagement from political leaders, according to the CGD. Funding requirements include donations for lead-testing equipment, support with advocacy and awareness campaigns, and technical assistance with drafting and enforcing regulations. But the CGD identified that annual philanthropic funds to prevent and mitigate lead exposure in low- and middle-income nations amount to just $11m. The CGD statement says dramatic action is needed to end the “slow-moving crisis” and calls on development agencies and banks to support governments in low- and middle-income countries to produce national strategies that include regulation and increased awareness. In the short term, reducing contamination, for example by removing products from the market, can have a significant impact. A 2019 study in Bangladesh found that turmeric was often adulterated with lead to make it brighter, and that this was the main source of lead exposure in the areas tested. In response, external donors helped sponsor an initiative with the Bangladesh Food Safety Authority and experts to educate the public about the dangers of lead. They also warned consumers to avoid bright yellow turmeric and notified suppliers about the legal penalties for lead adulteration. Health inspectors were then trained to test turmeric samples from a large wholesale market in the capital Dhaka, and offending sellers were fined. Researchers found that in 2019, just before this campaign, almost half of the turmeric sampled from Dhaka’s main wholesale market contained detectable amounts of lead. By 2021, a year after the initiative, this had dropped to zero.",Global development; Global health; Children; Health; Pollution; Environment; Poverty; Society; Children's health; World news,Global development
2023-11-16T10:00:11Z,‘Stop this obscenity’: could key UK summit turn tide on world hunger?,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/nov/16/andrew-mitchell-uk-development-aid-summit-food-waste-hunger-malnutrition,"The UK development minister, Andrew Mitchell, is staring down a test tube in a Surrey laboratory. He is looking at a specimen of the fall armyworm, a pest with a voracious appetite that can munch its way through an African maize crop at astonishing speed. The moth arrived on the African continent from the Americas in 2016, and has spread to 28 countries, gorging its way through maize, wheat and cotton at an alarming rate. Only the desert locust and the brown marmorated stink bug have been more destructive to arable farming. Mitchell’s visit to the Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International (Cabi) comes ahead of a global food security summit in London next week, hosted by the UK government. “It is going to come up with some very practical proposals,” Mitchell believes. The aim of the summit is “to demonstrate and interrogate the huge contribution that science, research and British academic institutions are making to the global problem of starvation and malnutrition”, he says. The lab, which is partly funded by the UK, combines research with practical advice, holding online clinics in locations including Kenya and Pakistan. It claims to have reached 60 million smallholder farmers since 2011. About 40% of food production worldwide is lost to pests and diseases, and one of Cabi’s strengths is its ability to spot trends in plant diseases. Its scientists say they are engaged in looking for nature-based solutions. If a local clinic cannot identify a disease, the plant is sent as a sample to Cabi headquarters for identification against its catalogue of 38,000 organisms. Mitchell says that, “for the global good”, the world needs to get away from pesticides and find ways to cut the cost of natural solutions and make them more user-friendly. “If we tackle food disease naturally, it is better for the environment, the soil, people.” Cabi is an unassuming piece of British soft power, says Mitchell, who was international development secretary under David Cameron and returned to lead the UK’s development brief in October 2022. He is determined to restore Britain’s reputation as a development superpower, and the food summit, combined with publication of a white paper, is the culmination of his work to reduce the mess left by Boris Johnson’s cuts to spending on aid and closure of the Department for International Development. Mitchell wants the summit to show the public that aid works. It is his ill fortune that the summit comes as the siege in Gaza, supported by the UK government, is taking a terrible toll on a civilian population. UN agencies have estimated that more than 1.6 million people in Gaza are in critical need of aid. Mitchell is determined to compartmentalise the issues, but if the Gaza crisis continues, it may be hard to do so at the summit. While sympathetic to Israel, Mitchell has a record that suggests he might not be supporting its methods if not for cabinet collective responsibility. In 2014, during a smaller outburst of violence in Gaza, he called for an arms embargo to be imposed on Israel. “There are very strict rules governing the conduct of international warfare, and the UN and the schools, which are places of sanctuary in Gaza, clearly should not be attacked,” he said then. For now, he promises the food security summit will try to answer the broader question of “how to stop the obscenity of children starving to death from malnutrition in a world where there is plenty of food”, and how to tackle the problem of food waste, pointing to the fact that 40% of all food grown is never eaten. This is not a conference at which donors will be asked to pledge funds, Mitchell says, but a chance to highlight the scientific work being undertaken to fight hunger and malnutrition. He has long been a fan of Plumpy’Nut, marvelling that “you can give this peanut-based paste to a malnourished child, and within half an hour they will be running around playing football”. Trialled in Niger 17 years ago, the vitamin- and protein-loaded paste has been given to millions of severely malnourished children. It does not need to be cooked or refrigerated, and stays fresh after opening. Mitchell has been on this beat for long enough to have seen some grim sights, and is especially haunted by hospital wards in Yemen. “It is often the same combination: a deeply malnourished child with a wide-eyed terrified mother by her side on the bed. “And sometimes, what has stood between them and death is British taxpayers’ money,” he says. But he has also seen food rotting by the side of the road in central Africa because farmers cannot transport their product to market or had no cold storage. As the climate crisis grips, he fears this waste will worsen. He wants his white paper to take British development policy to 2030 in a way that Labour, if elected, could also broadly adopt, and that would get the UN sustainable development goals back on track. It will also look at how to develop the Bridgetown Initiative proposed by the prime minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, and the reform of the global financial system. Mitchell hopes the summit will have an impact beyond development professionals. He has used previous summits, including ones on vaccination and family planning, to persuade sceptics that aid works. “You can take taxpayers with you,” he says, “but only if you keep making the argument.”",Food security; Global development; Andrew Mitchell; Politics; UK news; Society; World news; Aid; Hunger; Malnutrition; Food; Food waste; Environment; Yemen; Farming; Department for International Development (DfID); Middle East and north Africa,Global development
2024-01-02T14:00:34Z,"‘Electricity is fundamental to quality of life’: the man bringing off-grid, pay-as-you-go power to Africa",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/02/electricity-is-fundamental-to-quality-of-life-the-man-bringing-off-grid-pay-as-you-go-power-to-africa,"In the next four years, British entrepreneur Mansoor Hamayun expects to connect 36 million people to an electricity source, many for the first time. It is an ambition that would see his clean energy company, Bboxx, expand its reach tenfold across sub-Saharan Africa. The London-headquartered company has grown from an idealistic startup with hopes of transforming the lives of African households to a company offering pay-as-you-go solar power, batteries, smartphones and electric motorbikes to about 3.6 million people across Africa in little more than a decade. Now, a $100m (£78m) investment from EnerTech, a Kuwait-based investor, is about to spur its fastest growth yet. “Bboxx will turbocharge the impact we have on communities across sub-Saharan Africa,” Hamayun says. “Our shared vision is to transform the lives and livelihoods of our customers by giving them access to clean and affordable energy, clean cooking, e-mobility and technology like smartphones, that genuinely unlock their potential, day by day.” Bboxx was founded by Hamayun and two university friends – Christopher Baker-Brian and Laurent Van Houcke – to gain a foothold in the enormous untapped energy potential that the African market represents. It is one of a growing number of companies pioneering a new approach to energy supply: off-grid and pay-as-you-go. Hamayun’s story began about 15 years ago with 60 households in Rwanda. Over the course of a summer, while studying at Imperial College London, he set up a charity that provided six villages with solar electricity for the first time. The project continues to generate power to this day. The project began as an “academic challenge”, he says. At the time about 1.6 billion people globally were without access to reliable sources of electricity – and these numbers threatened to spiral as population growth outpaced progress on the world’s sustainable development goals. Since then, the number of people living without access to electricity across Asia’s developing economies has plunged, while Africa has remained largely in the dark. About 570 million people on the continent do not have access to electricity, and another 840 million are connected to an unreliable grid. “Africa is the biggest unserved consumer market on earth,” says Hamayun. Bboxx offers simple solar and battery systems which can provide light and power to homes that have no access to a stable electricity grid. The company also offers clean cookers, electric water pumps, smartphones and electric motorbikes. The impact is often profound. Access to reliable electricity can provide the power to open small businesses, educate children and safeguard the ill or vulnerable. “It’s transformational,” Hamayun says. “Electricity is so fundamental to ensuring an acceptable quality of life. I met a customer in Kenya last year who was extremely proud that her daughter had just been accepted to a medical university. She said the ability to have lights continuously at home helped tremendously in educating her children. They worked so hard, but the fact that we contributed a little bit towards that outcome … well, it’s incredibly motivating for all of us.” A customer in Rwanda recently praised Bboxx for increasing the amount of milk his cow was able to produce. “And I couldn’t work out how we had influenced this man’s cow,” he laughs. “He explained that thanks to the electricity he was able to run a water pump for the first time; and more water for the cow means more milk. In hindsight, it all makes total sense.” The story has stayed with Hamayun as a reminder of the myriad, unexpected ways that electricity can alter the lives of those who access it for the first time. The Bboxx business model hinges on Africa’s telecoms boom and the widespread adoption of “mobile money” banking, which has made pay-as-you-go an accessible option for millions of people who could not afford a longterm pay-monthly contract. “People might not be able to pay $30 a month for a service, but they can afford to pay $1 a day. Yet a lot of service-based offerings still call for monthly billing. It’s a very western way of thinking.” Switching from kerosene lamps and stoves to solar power and clean cookers is often cheaper, too, says Hamayun. “People don’t realise it’s expensive to be poor in Africa. A lot of goods are more expensive there than in the UK. We’re offering a cheaper option on better terms.” Hamayun says Bboxx’s rivalry with similar companies is not in the battle for potential customers, but in the area of recruitment. “Where competition is fierce is in finding capital and talent,” he says. “There is a limited pool of money, which is smaller than what the size of the market requires.” Bboxx has the backing of Japanese utility giant Mitsubishi and France’s Engie, and has secured regional partnerships with major western energy companies including EDF to help increase their reach across the continent. For these major utilities Africa provides a testbed for a new, digital data-led energy system still in its infancy in the developed world. Already, the continent is “leapfrogging” the need for centralised fossil fuel power plants and costly grid systems by leaning on renewables and data, Hamayun says. “There really are no limits to the scale that you can grow in this market. Take Nigeria: it has a population of about 228 million people, but this is forecast to grow to 400 million by 2050. Already, its power grid is extremely unreliable, so the size of the challenge is enormous. But at the same time, it is a country with a young population that has the ability to change and adapt to new technology. “You have all of these factors at play at the same time, which makes Africa very exciting.” CV Age 35 Family Married with a “kid on the way” Education Masters of engineering, electrical and electronic engineering from Imperial College London Pay £300k + “other typical CEO stuff” Biggest career mistake “Not focusing on the culture of the business from Day Zero and maintaining it throughout” Best advice he has been given There is no shortcut to hard work Overused phrase Make the impossible, possible What he does to relax Socialising in all its forms.

2023-10-08T14:00:46Z,How the UK’s dying high streets are being given new life by pop-up shops and galleries,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/oct/08/how-the-uks-dying-high-streets-are-being-given-new-life-by-pop-up-shops-and-galleries,"While the familiar high street names pull down the shutters, artists, independent retailers, local makers, sustainability campaigners and community action groups are taking over abandoned retail spaces, with sustainability and inclusivity top of the agenda. The number of pop-ups has increased by 18% in the past year, although some represent big brands. “I think at the core of it is a belief that the town centre is not dying,” artist Daniel Thompson told the Observer. Thompson founded the Empty Shops Network, which for nearly two decades has supported artists to take over empty shops for exhibitions and creative projects. Part of the aim, Thompson said, was to make art more accessible to new and diverse audiences. “When you put contemporary art in an empty shop, you get people who would never set foot in a gallery,” said Thompson. “But when they wander into what used to be the greengrocers, they’re looking at art, they are thinking about art, and they are having an experience. That’s such a joy to see. “We have tried a model of how to build town centres for 30 years and it didn’t work,” he added. “We’ve relied on the big anchors of the high street, such as Woolworths and Wilko, and let monoculture take over. Now we are seeing a proper ecology develop in town centres: a bit of civic use, social space, retail, residential, places to be in the evenings.” In Plymouth, transforming a marginalised space into a thriving and accessible one is the driving force behind the Nudge Community Builders, which in the past five years has unlocked 25% of the empty buildings along the city’s rundown Union Street. From a street that was notorious for antisocial behaviour, the area is now host to civic conversations, street parties, local artist studios, community groups, and business startups, all for local people and often led by marginalised groups. Working from the principle that “empty buildings are not OK”, Nudge invites local people to become shareholders so that they can purchase and repurpose abandoned properties, giving them a stake in how the street is evolving. “As local residents ,we’re really passionate about how we host spaces that are really inclusive,” said Hannah Sloggett, co-director of Nudge Community Builders. “We’re interested in collective ownership of land and buildings, and how they are brought back into use in fun and interesting ways, with lasting local benefits.” One such small business is Jabulani, caterers specialising in training local women to start their own food enterprises and share their culture. “It helps black and Asian women on their food journey,” said Sloggett. “From navigating environmental health, to the logistics of setting up a business, they are supporting women who may be marginalised in some way to overcome barriers.” Nudge works with regional suppliers spending 53% within a mile of the street and 95% in the city so that its development supports Plymouth’s economy. It’s an approach shared by the retailers in Sparks Bristol, where Sam McKay’s Ethical Gift Shop is busy with shoppers buying locally sourced products that make perfect stocking-fillers and birthday gifts. “My shop stocks 92 local suppliers,” said McKay proudly. “By Christmas, I want it to be 100.” “The proportion of money that goes back into the local economy from our pop-ups is far greater than from the big shops,” said Tillie Peel, founder of the Pop-Up Club, which has supported independent retailers and local makers to set up in empty storefronts across England. “People love coming into the shops and discovering new things,” she adds. “We have children getting excited about being creative. One teenage girl told me she loved our spaces, as they are ‘bougie and weird, like me!’” Peel, whose background is in vintage clothing, is passionate about sustainability and sees the pop-up movement as helping to foster a reuse culture, a view shared by Sparks. Beyond the retail offering, Sparks connects visitors with advisers on energy use, and by creating welcoming spaces where people can engage in conversations about the climate crisis. “The aim of Sparks was to provide easy and affordable ways for people to be able to play their part when it comes to achieving the sustainable development goals,” says project manager Jenny Foster. “We’re trying to show people easy ways to be part of the solution, as well as inspiring people with what shopping and the high street can look like”. “It’s an approach that helps people see the place they live differently,” says Thompson, reflecting on the growth of the empty shops movement. “It gives a sense of pride. If we’re going to change the world, the first thing you have to be able to do is imagine a better world. And that imagination is what we let happen”. • This article was amended on 9 October 2023 to correct the first name of Sam McKay, which in an earlier version was given as “Sean”, and to refer to the department store by its full name, Sparks Bristol.",Retail industry; Sustainable development; Plymouth; Small business; Business; UK news,Business
2023-07-19T11:36:33Z,UK minister seeks cross-party support for bold roadmap on development goals,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jul/19/uk-minister-seeks-cross-party-support-for-bold-roadmap-on-development-goals,"The international development minister, Andrew Mitchell, is taking the unusual step of trying to build explicit cross-party support for a white paper due to be published this autumn amid a string of critical global summits. Announcing the initiative this week, he told the Guardian: “The white paper will be a parliamentary command paper by the government, but it does not work unless you have agreement across the political parties. After all, international development and British leadership on this is not a Labour or Tory thing. It’s a British thing.” He said he had already consulted the shadow foreign and development teams, as well as the Labour chair of the international development select committee, Sarah Champion, and former Labour foreign ministers. “This is intended as a through train – not just about the next year or so – and it has to be all-party. The white paper is designed to set out a roadmap until 2030. It will only work if it is seen as something that will survive the next election, regardless of the result.” Mitchell, brought back into government in October despite his fierce criticism of government cuts to the aid budget, said the focus of the white paper will be climate finance and getting the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) back on track to meet their 2030 deadline. The paper, entitled “leading the charge against extreme poverty and climate change – a roadmap for reaching the global goals in a changing world”, is likely to be published around the time of a major food summit being convened by the UK in London in autumn. A summit to discuss progress towards meeting the SDGs will be held at UN headquarters in New York in September, and COP 28 will follow in Dubai in November. “We need new solutions that can drive more resources, whether sweating the assets of the international financial institutions further, as the Bridgetown Initiative has called on us to do, or drawing in more private finance,” said Mitchell. “The white paper will consider how to use all the levers at our disposal, including special drawing rights, in government but also outside it.” The minister, who wants to boost public support for an increased aid budget, has been trying to reassemble some of the UK’s development expertise, both inside and outside government, after it was scattered and demoralised by the merger of the Department for International Development with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 2020. He described the merger as “an ocean-going disaster, in his personal view”, but added that officials would be appalled if the merger were now undone. It was significant, he said, that Labour has not committed itself to undoing the merger. The white paper would, in some measure, be an answer to the rising anger of the global south that sees the west pouring money into Ukraine while those countries fear their concerns – global finance, hunger and the climate crisis – are being neglected, Mitchell added. He argued: “The most significant issue in the world is migration, because everyone has a mobile phone and everyone knows there’s a better life 100, 200, 500 miles away. If you don’t build safer, stronger, less conflict-ridden, more prosperous lives where they live, they’re going to move. “The whole thrust of British development policy is to build safer and more prosperous states over there, so that people don’t have to come in boats to the UK, risking their lives.”",Aid; Global development; Andrew Mitchell; Politics; UK news; Society; World news; United Nations,Global development
2023-10-08T23:45:21Z,"Xi Jinping’s wants a ‘multipolar world’, as China accelerates its shift away from the west",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/09/xi-jinpings-wants-a-multipolar-world-as-china-accelerates-its-shift-away-from-the-west,"It was a difficult summer for China’s leader, Xi Jinping. He was faced with natural disasters, economic uncertainty and a roster of disappearing ministers that had observers around the world speculating on their fate. But one brief highlight among the gloom was the Brics summit in Johannesburg, in which six new countries were added to the bloc of emerging economies, more than doubling its size. With the addition of the new members, Brics will account for nearly half of the world’s population. Xi had long called for the admission of new members to strengthen the bloc’s voice on the world stage and the expansion comes just as Beijing attempts to preserve and expand its international influence in the face of increasingly strained relations with the US. China’s domestic troubles are piling up, with slowing economic growth and high youth unemployment. The war in Ukraine has led to Beijing providing an economic lifeline to Russia which has strained relations with the west and made China increasingly focused on winning influence in the global south. Burnishing the country’s international image is key to this goal; research published this year by Pew found that across all the rich countries it surveyed, a majority of people had an unfavourable opinion of China. In middle-income countries however, attitudes were rosier, with more than 70% of people in Kenya and Nigeria reporting positive views on China. So although Beijing has not yet given up hope of preserving dialogue and trade with western partners, its diplomatic efforts are now split between maintaining those relations and making an ideological and economic appeal to those middle-income countries in the global south. “As the largest developing country, China is a natural member of the global south,” Chinese vice-president Han Zheng told the UN general assembly in September. “It breathes the same breath with other developing countries and shares the same future with them”. The fact that, as of next year, Brics will include countries as diverse as Ethiopia, Iran and Argentina, with Russia and China at the helm, is a gift for Beijing because it “chips away at the credibility of the western-led, international rules-based order,” says Eric Olander, the editor-in-chief of the China-Global South Project website. Olander notes that the desire to build a “parallel international governance architecture” could be partly motivated by a desire in Beijing to make up for lost access to western markets. A powerful economic and ideological appeal Beijing’s emphasis on building a “multipolar world” is a clarion call for developing countries, apparent in the gradual shift from the belt and road initiative (BRI) to the Global Development Initiative (GDI). Launched ten years ago, the BRI has, according to China’s foreign ministry, galvanised $1trn of investment in nearly 150 countries. The willingness of Chinese lenders to extend loans to countries that often struggle to get financing from institutions like the World Bank won Beijing friends in many places. But it also led to huge amounts of debt and, in some cases, resentment from local populations. Research published this year found that China spent $240bn bailing out countries struggling with their BRI debts between 2008 and 2021. And so in 2021, at an address to the United Nations, Xi launched the GDI, a programme to promote international cooperation in a range of policy areas compatible with the UN’s sustainable development goals, including poverty alleviation and responses to climate change. Soon after the Brics summit, Beijing announced the launch of a $10bn fund to support the GDI. China’s struggling economy may threaten to limit its ability to shower cash on pliable neighbours. One major difference between the BRI and the GDI is the scale of funding offered by the initiatives. The GDI “will not be able to compare with the BRI” in terms of financial support, says Yun Sun, the director of the China programme at the Stimson Center, a US thinktank. But it isn’t the only tool at its disposal. Another sign of Beijing’s growing influence in the south is the spread of Confucius Institutes, Chinese state-backed cultural and educational centres that offer Mandarin lessons in more than 100 countries around the world. In the UK, Europe and the US, the centres have come under scrutiny over alleged limits to free speech in the classrooms. Rishi Sunak, the UK’s prime minister, pledged to close them last year, although he has since rolled back on that promise. But in the US, 111 have been closed since 2018, according to the National Association of Scholars, a New York-based non-profit. Just 10 remain. Compare that to Africa, Latin America, and South-east Asia, where the institutes remain popular and where the “political questions about what they’re teaching and how they’re teaching it is not as sensitive,” said Olander. There are now 57 in Latin America and the Caribbean, according to the Andrés Bello Foundation, an institute in Colombia that researches the region’s relationship with China. In the last two years, the number of people applying to study Chinese language teaching at the National University of Laos’s Confucius Institute has tripled, to 562. As hopes of political liberalisation in China fade into the distant past, Beijing’s primary hope for wielding influence in the west is from its weight as an economic superpower and important partner in tackling transnational issues, such as climate change. But to the global south, Beijing promotes an alternative world order, with an ideological and economic appeal that remains powerful.",China; Xi Jinping; Belt and road initiative; Asia Pacific,World news
2023-11-13T16:04:21Z,David Cameron is a big international figure but what will he do as UK foreign secretary?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/13/david-cameron-is-a-big-international-figure-but-what-will-he-do-as-foreign-secretary,"When Margaret Thatcher appointed Lord Carrington, the last Conservative foreign secretary based in the House of Lords, she said she had done so because he only had to walk into a room to establish his natural authority. Although Carrington admired her sense of duty, the compliment was not completely returned. He once confided: “I think she had hardly been outside the country. From my point of view this was a considerable advantage for she could hardly contradict me when I told her where Rhodesia was.” He also occasionally chided his prime minister in meetings with visiting presidents, passing her notes: “He has come five hundred miles. Don’t you think you should let him say something?” There was little doubt that Carrington was the dominant figure when it came to the broad sweep of foreign policy, if not relations with Europe. There is a danger that Lord Cameron, with six years’ experience as prime minister and umpteen world summits under his belt, as opposed to Rishi Sunak’s single year, will be tempted not only to dominate foreign policy but to stray out of his lane and give very broad advice to his boss. But with only a year to go till the next election, and two of the biggest foreign policy crises to face the UK since the Iraq war, Sunak will hope that Cameron’s major contribution will be to bring a Carrington-style air of stability and authority to the UK’s contribution to foreign policy. The perception overseas has been that Britain has been a country at best suffering strategic drift, and at worst on the verge of a nervous political breakdown. Only the contribution in Ukraine – playing to British security and defence strengths – and the UK’s intangible soft power have prevented decline turning into something worse. Cameron, by being a big figure, can change that. But it contains risks for Sunak. At a moment of great geopolitical consequence, he is relinquishing responsibility for foreign policy to Cameron – just as Tony Blair largely relinquished domestic economic policy to Gordon Brown. Although some of the big global players of Cameron’s era have left the stage – Angela Merkel, Barack Obama, Nicolas Sarkozy – many others are still around: Donald Tusk, Mark Rutte, Vladimir Putin, Benjamin Netanyahu, King Abdullah of Jordan, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Xi Jinping, Cyril Ramaphosa and Narendra Modi. If the personalities are familiar, the issues are not. For instance, Cameron worked very hard in the opening years of his premiership, like Tony Blair, to form a strong leadership with Putin – even proposing the Russian gas pipeline Nord Stream could extend to the UK. But the courtship fell apart over Russia’s support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Cameron was initially a great supporter of the Syrian democratic revolution, even if he would admit in private that the Free Syrian Army was neither free, Syrian nor an army. His support for the revolution pitted him against Putin permanently. Yet when he needed MPs’ support in 2013 to punish Assad and, by extension, Putin, for the use of chemical weapons, he was abandoned. The legacy of Iraq hung over Britain and the public’s willingness to intervene militarily, he concluded. So given that chastening experience, Cameron will be content with the current balance of the UK policy on Ukraine: resolute against Russia and against direct UK intervention. Instead, he will be thinking how to rekindle the public’s enthusiasm for the Ukrainian cause, and Ukraine’s aspiration to join the EU. Stand by for a lot of “Fire up the Quattro” rhetoric, especially when he meets European prevarication over arms supplies. He is after all a strong Nato man, the architect of the 2014 summit that led member states to commit to spending reaching 2% of GDP. On the second great foreign policy crisis – the Palestinian issue – Cameron is an enthusiast for the state of Israel, but capable of telling Israel that Gaza as an open-air prison is in no one’s interest. He tried in a speech to the Knesset in 2014 to avoid the weeds of an eventual peace deal and instead give Israel a vision of the benefits of peace and compromise. He will be a friend of Israel, but a more critical friend than his predecessor, who largely went through the motions of supporting a two-state solution. Knowing Cameron, he will also be asking his former foreign policy adviser in No 10 John Casson how Britain can insert itself into the debate about what happens in Gaza on the day after the defeat of Hamas. Casson was recently deeply critical about the banality of the British debate. Cameron is also likely to echo Joe Biden in suggesting to Netanyahu that lessons have to be learned from the west’s flawed response to 9-11. One of the leitmotifs of Cameron’s premiership was the threat of radicalised terrorists returning from Syria, and the sources of extremism. Given that experience, he will have to make a judgment whether a purely military solution in Gaza is a chimera, and how to tell the Israelis as much. Many foreign policy analysts think the west has not yet understood the whirlwind it will soon reap for its perceived double standards over Ukraine and Israel. His friends say he knows he is braced for criticism for his business dealings with China, as he has already endured from the intelligence and security committee. China-sceptic Tory backbenchers hate his enthusiastic embrace as prime minister of the golden era in relations with China. But his friends say since then, human rights issues in Xinjiang and the suppression of the Hong Kong democracy protests have changed the facts. In reality, British policy in China – largely led by Washington – has been in a state of permanent flux, and is leaning away from confrontation and back to engagement, Cameron’s natural stance. If he has the headspace, Cameron may also return to two enthusiasms: development and fighting corruption. He has a great ally in the development minister, Andrew Mitchell, and will take a personal interest in a development white paper due shortly. He sees UK aid as a reason to be patriotic, and out of office took on a job updating the UN sustainable development goals. As chair of the G8 in 2013, he started asking British overseas territories some hard questions about hiding economic crime. Again it was an issue that he pursued with Transparency International out of office. One flaw Cameron will have to watch is arrogance. He regards himself as a natural leader, but he made mistakes ranging from the aberration of Libya to the massive unforced error of Brexit. All political careers end in failure, but few get resurrected after such a complete one as his.",David Cameron; Foreign policy; Politics; Conservatives; House of Lords; Rishi Sunak; Ukraine; Israel-Gaza war; Palestinian territories; Israel; Gaza; Syria,Politics
2023-10-16T16:54:39Z,China woos global south and embraces Putin at belt and road Beijing summit,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/16/china-woos-global-south-and-embraces-putin-at-belt-and-road-beijing-summit,"World leaders are gathering in Beijing for China’s belt and road initiative (BRI) forum, the third such event since the trademark global development drive was launched by President Xi Jinping 10 years ago. The BRI was originally envisioned as a vast physical and digital infrastructure project to connect China with central Asia, south-east Asia, Europe and the rest of the world. It later broadened into a mammoth infrastructure financing vehicle for Chinese lenders to support projects in nearly every corner of the world, particularly in the global south. With that support came China’s mounting influence on the world stage, even as western countries became increasingly sceptical of the BRI. In one of the biggest international conferences since China abandoned its zero-Covid policy at the end of last year and reopened borders, the BRI summit is as notable for its absences as for those attending. Of the more than 130 countries going to the two-day summit, which kicks off on Tuesday, the most senior representative from the EU is expected to be Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s prime minister, who is much more supportive of China than other leaders in the bloc. Analysts see Xi making a renewed focus on engagement with the global south, as relations with the west are increasingly frosty. Other notable guests include the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and a representative of the Taliban. The last time Putin visited Beijing was shortly before his troops invaded Ukraine. Putin – who has travelled little abroad since the international criminal court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for his arrest in March – arrived in Beijing on Tuesday. The ICC’s warrant obliges the court’s 123 member states to arrest Putin and transfer him to The Hague for trial if he sets foot on their territory. China is not a member of the ICC The invitation of Putin to Xi’s flagship summit was effectively an “outvite” to western governments and organisations, said Christoph Nedopil Wang, the director of the Griffith Asia Institute. It emphasises the alignment of Chinese and Russian political priorities, even as Beijing has tried to position itself as a peacemaker in the Ukraine conflict. Russia has made similar overtures. On Monday it said that it was joining China in restricting imports of Japanese seafood amid concerns about contamination related to the release of wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant. Some analysts argue that the restrictions are motivated by political rather than safety concerns. But the attendance of Putin at the BRI, despite the fact that Russia has not officially signed up to the initiative, underlines the close relationship between the two countries. Xi hopes to use the forum to promote China (and Russia’s) “multipolar” worldview that they argue gives the global south more agency. The offer is increasingly a political one, as the amount of financing available – and desired – through the BRI has tapered off. Recent research published by Boston University found that while China’s development finance institutions provided about $331bn (£271bn) to recipient countries between 2013 and 2021, “many of the recipients of Chinese finance are subject to significant debt distress”. China has also spent about $240bn bailing out countries struggling with their BRI debts, according to separate research published earlier this year. BRI financing was increasingly focused on smaller projects, with specific aims relating to social or political goals, said Linda Calabrese, a research fellow at ODI, a global affairs thinktank. That is a shift that is also driven by borrowers who are increasingly concerned about ending up in situations of unmanageable debts or infrastructure projects. It is a marked difference from when the BRI was launched in 2013. Xi, then newly minted as China’s leader, seemed like an ascendant force on the world stage. Beijing promised to support countries that had not been served by traditional multilateral lenders. But since then there has been a trade war with the US, Russia’s war in Ukraine, a global pandemic and slowing economic growth in China, all of which have dragged on China’s development ambitions. About $1tn of investment has been galvanised under the auspices of the BRI, according to China’s foreign ministry, but the volume of lending to poor countries peaked several years ago. Last year at the UN general assembly, Xi launched the idea of a global development initiative (GDI), China’s new development concept linked to the UN’s sustainable development goals. That “sharpened the focus of the BRI [as] a more commercial initiative compared to the more classical development-focused GDI”, said Nedopil-Wang. Beijing also wants to shift to quality rather than quantity when it comes to its overseas lending and investments. In a white paper published last week, the Chinese government said that “the ultimate goal of the BRI is to help build a global community of shared future”. That means focusing on issues such as food security, infectious diseases, artificial intelligence and climate change, according to the white paper, rather than just economic development. The white paper called for “high-quality growth”, using what has also been a buzzword for China’s domestic economic policy. In recent months, Beijing has tried to position itself as a member of the global south, despite the fact that as the world’s second-largest economy it has a heft on the world stage matched only by the US. China’s alignment with the global south may be hard to sustain in terms of raw economic development, as China has jumped from being a low-income country to an upper middle-income country in lightning-fast speed. But with the strong focus on the global south at this week’s BRI forum, Beijing is trying to make clear that its offer to the global south is still more attractive than the offer from Brussels or Washington.",Belt and road initiative; China; Asia Pacific; World news; Russia; Xi Jinping,World news
2023-03-31T17:12:22Z,Economic growth is needed to reduce global poverty | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/mar/31/economic-growth-is-needed-to-reduce-global-poverty,"I’m very grateful to Olivier de Schutter, UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, for his discussion of the paper by me and Zack Gehan on future growth forecasts and poverty in 2050 (Economic growth is not a magic wand for ending poverty, 20 March). There is much to agree with in his analysis, but I’d disagree with his statement that our efforts today “should focus on reducing inequalities, not on growing the economy”. Lower inequality is an important goal, but GDP growth will also be necessary to ensure that everyone worldwide has a decent standard of living. I’d strongly agree with him that there is much more to life than economic growth and that the World Bank’s international poverty line of $2.15 (£1.80) a day is an utterly inadequate consumption level for a high quality of life. But, whether the poverty line is set at $2.15 or $10 or higher, economic growth is going to be necessary to ensure no one lives below it – and the higher the poverty line, the more growth will be required. There isn’t a single low-income country that reports $2.15 poverty below 13%, for example. Outside Ukraine, the lowest poverty rate at $6.85 a day in low- and lower-middle-income countries as a group is 16%. Historically, the only places we’ve seen the most extreme poverty reduced to fractions of a percentage point is in richer countries. We are off-track on the growth target specified in the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs), and inadequate economic growth is the major reason we will not meet the SDG extreme poverty target. Zack Gehan and I forecast that we might meet the poverty target 20 years after the SDG deadline, in 2050 – although even that is based on considerably outperforming historical growth rates. So, two cheers for GDP growth in the world’s poorest countries. It is far from a panacea, but it is also absolutely necessary part of the struggle to sustainably improve global quality of life.

2023-07-17T17:00:31Z,Top economists call for action on runaway global inequality,https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2023/jul/17/top-economists-call-for-action-global-inequality-rich-poor-poverty-climate-breakdown-un-world-bank,"Failure to tackle the widening gulf between the world’s rich and poor will entrench poverty and increase the risk of climate breakdown, a group of more than 200 leading economists have said. In a letter to the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and the World Bank president, Ajay Banga, the signatories from 67 countries call on the two bodies to do more to reverse the sharpest increase in global inequality since the second world war. Those backing the call for action include the former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, New Zealand’s former prime minister Helen Clark and the economists Jayati Ghosh, Joseph Stiglitz and Thomas Piketty. Reducing inequality by 2030 was one of the 17 UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) agreed by the international community in 2015. The letter says urgent action is needed in light of the differing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on rich and poor. Arguing that rising inequality has been “largely ignored”, the letter says the current means for assessing progress in tackling the problem – faster income growth for the poorest 40% than for the population as a whole – fails to take account of the concentration of income and wealth among the super-rich. For the first time in a quarter of a century, global poverty and extreme wealth have been rising simultaneously, the letter says. It continues: “Goals matter. Leadership matters. The [World] Bank and UN SDGs are uniquely placed to offer the rallying call for a reduction in inequality that our divided world needs so urgently today.” The letter demands better measurement of inequality and more ambitious targets for narrowing income and wealth gaps. “We are living through a time of extraordinarily high economic inequality. Extreme poverty and extreme wealth have risen sharply and simultaneously for the first time in 25 years. Between 2019 and 2020, global inequality grew more rapidly than at any time since WW2,” it says. “The richest 10% of the global population currently takes 52% of global income, whereas the poorest half of the population earns 8.5% of it. Billions of people face the terrible hardship of high and rising food prices and hunger, whilst the number of billionaires has doubled in the last decade.” When Guterres reviewed the 2030 goals in April, he found inequality at a record high, with only 10% of countries on track to meet the target. Last October, the World Bank said progress in reducing poverty had come to a halt. It forecast that without a dramatic acceleration of efforts, there would be no chance of meeting the goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030. Banga is conducting a review of the Bank’s mission and is under pressure from some member countries, such as Germany, to take the fight against inequality more seriously. The letter says: “We know that high inequality undermines all our social and environmental goals. It corrodes our politics, destroys trust, hamstrings our collective economic prosperity and weakens multilateralism. We also know that without a sharp reduction in inequality, the twin goals of ending poverty and preventing climate breakdown will be in clear conflict.” It says tackling inequality is not a standalone goal and that all economic, financial, and social policies should be assessed in terms of their probable impact on it. “This would clearly signal our collective ambition to forge a more equal world,” it adds. Max Lawson, the head of inequality policy at Oxfam International, said: “Never has the fight to close the gap between the rich and the rest of us been more urgent. A dramatic increase in equality is the key to a better world, and to beating climate breakdown before it is too late.” Matthew Martin, the director of the campaign group Development Finance International, said: “If we don’t start measuring inequality properly now, we will never reduce it seriously by 2030.” A World Bank spokesperson said: “Inequality is unacceptably high around the world today as the poorest people continue to bear the steepest costs of the Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath. The World Bank is committed to tackling inequality in all its forms – the path to ensure no one gets left behind. “We agree that we need to do more to address inequality, and to do better in measuring progress. The ideas proposed in the open letter are a welcome contribution to this discussion.”",Inequality; United Nations; World Bank; Business; Economics; World news,Inequality
2023-09-06T07:00:50Z,Business is booming for human traffickers because they know they’ll get away with it | Gordon Brown,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/sep/06/business-human-traffickers-modern-slavery,"More than 200 years after the international slave trade was formally abolished, the terrible truth is there has never been a better time to sell a human life than today. Business is booming for the criminals who engage in human trafficking, forced labour and modern slavery, not just across Asia, Africa and the Americas, but in mainland Europe and across the Channel into Britain too. Every day, traffickers are pushing desperate men, women and children into the hell of modern slavery in the knowledge that their crime is almost cost-free. There should be no hiding place for criminals who trade in people, but the likelihood of criminal exploiters being put behind bars is remote. While there are 50 million people living in modern slavery worldwide, only 15,159 traffickers were prosecuted in 2022 and just 5,577 guilty verdicts were returned, equating to one conviction for every 8,965 victims. This weekend’s G20 leaders’ summit in New Delhi can seize the opportunity to ensure the UN’s goal of eradicating modern slavery by 2030 does not fade from view. I have written to the summit host, Narendra Modi, prime minister of India – the country with the highest number of people living in modern slavery – asking him to place on the G20 agenda the abject failure of any government in any part of the world to close down the slave traders. To put the size of the industry into context, its profits, which are nothing less than blood money, total more than $150bn (£118.5bn) annually. Convictions against people-trafficking are so low that in the whole of the Americas, from Canada and the US to Argentina and Brazil, just 256 convictions were recorded last year. The UK is recognised in the Global Slavery Index as tougher on modern slavery, but while nearly 23,000 potential victims were identified in Britain from 2017 to 2019, only 64 offenders were sentenced for modern slavery and human trafficking offences under the Modern Slavery Act. Small wonder the traffickers, whose boats cross the Channel, feel they can act with impunity. This low clear-up rate is all the more shameful because human slavery, the most heinous and barbaric of all crimes, is degrading 28 million men and women through forced labour and demeaning conditions – and causing lifelong desolation to 22 million girls and women, who have been forced into marriage against their will. The scale of modern-day human enslavement means we all lose. For as the UN security council has stated, human trafficking is a “tactic of terrorism” and a significant source of terrorists’ funds. Yet slavery prosecutions are in decline. In 2015, there were 19,000 prosecutions worldwide; by 2022 the figure was almost 4,000 fewer. As former prime minister Theresa May told the Commons in July, the Illegal Migration Act will soon contribute to an alarming rise in human slavery. The act no longer requires authorities to identify victims of modern slavery before their return to their country of origin and fails to provide the support and protection necessary to enable victims to give evidence to expose their exploiters, thereby rendering it unlikely that traffickers are investigated. As a result, a human trafficking victim who arrives in the UK and who has been raped, or their family threatened, may just be turned away. Current reporting of slavery to the authorities is so low that last year only 115,000 victims were identified worldwide, with the majority of victims escaping from traffickers and alerting the authorities themselves, as opposed to being rescued by law enforcement. Yet not far from where each of us live, there will be a trafficked boy or girl, man or woman, working as a domestic servant, car washer or assembly worker. And many of us will buy items, including premium brands, that involve human trafficking or forced labour in their manufacture. Religious organisations led by the G20 Interfaith Forum have highlighted the “urgent need” for G20 countries – which account for more than 75% of the world’s trade – to address crimes too often hidden in plain sight. It will need coordinated action by the G20 to reform global supply chains and puncture the complacency of well-known clothing, electronics and other brands that have been wilfully ignoring the slave trade. This action must include a call for the global introduction of due diligence laws that require businesses to monitor and report on the risks of slavery in their supply chains. So far, countries including Norway, France and Germany have adopted such laws and, to her credit, Theresa May is setting up a global commission on modern slavery and human trafficking that is likely to make the case for extending such legislation worldwide. It was in 2016, when the sustainable development goals for 2030 were being formulated by the UN, that Pope Francis urged nations around the world to help enslaved people and prosecute traffickers. There has followed seven lean years, during which little progress has been made. Now with just seven years left to meet the 2030 goal, the G20 must start to live up to its claim to be the world’s premier economic forum – and intensify its mission to eradicate the modern slave trade.

2023-07-17T15:34:55Z,UK bilateral aid to start rising after ‘terrible’ cuts,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/17/uk-bilateral-aid-andrew-mitchell,"The UK’s bilateral overseas aid budget will start to increase in 2024-25 after taking a “terrible hit” over the previous three years, Andrew Mitchell, the minister for development and Africa, has said. The overall aid budget, covering multilateral and bilateral aid, is to rise from £7.4bn this financial year to £8.3bn next year, he said. It was £6.9bn in 2022-23. Official projections being published on Monday by the Foreign Office showed bilateral aid funding to the lowest-income countries would nearly double in 2024-25; as would bilateral aid to Africa as a region, from £646m this financial year to £1.36bn next year. Mitchell added he would budget for £1bn in humanitarian aid. He said bilateral spending had taken “an enormous hit” in 2023-24 to maintain the government’s multilateral aid commitments. However, he said he was confident the projections for 2024-25 were reliable, reflecting economic growth, tighter control of the budget and expected cuts to the costs incurred by the Home Office of housing and feeding refugees arriving in the UK. He said a joint Foreign Office-Treasury star chamber was helping to bring down spending on refugees by hundreds of thousands of pounds. “Because we managed to exert that control over the budget, the figures next year are very sharply up,” Mitchell said. This would allow bilateral aid to Afghanistan to rise from £100m to £151m next year, still below the £246m in 2022-23. Aid to Pakistan, which has experienced severe flooding, would rise from £41m to £133m. Other big projected rises include Ethiopia, from £89m to £214m; Somalia from £90m to £138m; and South Sudan from £47.9m to £111m. Few of the rises would fully compensate for past cuts. Mitchell said the permission to publish the planned allocations for next year was a sign of Treasury confidence that his team had got spending under control, and would give officials a chance to make the long-term plans required in development. With plans to publish a white paper well advanced, Mitchell, who was a fierce critic of aid spending cuts from the backbenches, and a vastly experienced aid minister going back to 2005, said he hoped he could convince the aid community that he made the right decision to return to government last year to fix the budget and to try to restore the UK’s lost reputation as an aid superpower. “Officials have been through the most ghastly period with three sets of cuts before, as a result of budgets being cut back. It has been a terrible time for some officials, who will have found it unbelievably difficult to effectively break promises and go back on programme commitments.” Mitchell did not recant his past opposition to the merger of the Department of International Development and the Foreign Office, engineered by Boris Johnson in June 2020. “If you’re asking me whether the merger was an ocean-going disaster, my personal opinion is that it was and it should never have happened. It was a great, great mistake in my personal opinion. “However, I’ve been asked by the prime minister to come back here, make it work. And there is a way of making it work. “One thing I learned in the City as a kid working for [the financial firm] Lazards is that there’s no such thing as a merger. One side wins, and one side loses. And, frankly, meeting different old DfID officials in this building, when I came back, was like meeting people coming out of the rubble from a nuclear blast. But if officials were now told they are to go back to DfID they would pass out. It is infinitely better to make this work.” Critics will say the projected rises are welcome, but will still not return aid spending to anywhere near the levels spent when the budget was set at 0.7% of GDP, instead of the current 0.5%. On current projections the government will only meet the conditions it has set for the aid budget to rise again to 0.7% in 2027-28. Mitchell said he hoped to publish a white paper in the autumn that could attract cross-party support to rejuvenate British thinking on climate change and the sustainable development goals. He said he hoped it would go some way to answering the global south’s anger about the amount of money being channeled to Ukraine by the west. “They see the rich world spending money on humanitarian needs in Ukraine when children are dying in the Horn of Africa. And they resent that.”",Foreign policy; Aid; Politics; Global development; UK news; Andrew Mitchell,Politics
2023-06-06T13:30:09Z,"Poorest countries are biggest losers from economic shocks, says World Bank",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/06/poorest-countries-biggest-losers-global-economic-world-bank-covid-ukraine-banks,"The world’s poorest countries are the biggest losers from a global economy failing to cope with the combined impact of the Covid pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the tough anti-inflationary measures taken by central banks, the World Bank has said. In its half-yearly update, the Washington-based body said the international community was well off course to meet the UN’s 2030 anti-poverty development goals and warned of the risk of a fresh debt crisis for the most vulnerable countries. The Bank said the global economy was struggling despite slightly revising up its 2023 growth forecasts and no longer fearing a second recession in the space of three years. It said the upbeat news was already in the past and predicted a slowdown in the second half of the year as the impact of higher interest rates in rich countries rippled out to emerging and developing nations. The global economic prospects report – which focuses primarily on the outlook for the less-advanced economies – forecast world growth of 2.1% in 2023, down from 3.1% in 2022 and 6% in 2021. Compared with forecasts made in January, growth is expected to be 0.4 percentage points higher this year but 0.3 points lower in 2024. Seven in 10 countries would have slower growth in 2023 than in 2022, the report says. “The world economy is in a precarious position,” said Indermit Gill, the World Bank chief economist. “Outside of east and south Asia, it is a long way from the dynamism needed to eliminate poverty, counter climate change, and replenish human capital. “In emerging markets and developing economies, debt pressures are growing due to higher interest rates. Fiscal weaknesses have already tipped many low-income countries into debt distress. Meanwhile, the financing needs to achieve the sustainable development goals are far greater than even the most optimistic projections of private investment.” Gill said emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) were struggling to cope and the optimism that arose as China came out of lockdown proved to be fleeting. According to the Bank’s forecasts, growth in EMDEs other than China will fall from 4.1% in 2022 to 2.9% in 2023. Battered by high inflation, rising interest rates and record debt levels many countries were growing poorer. Fourteen low-income countries are already in, or at high risk of, debt distress, up from just six in 2015. Gill said: “By the end of 2024, per-capita income growth in about a third of EMDEs will be lower than it was on the eve of the pandemic. In low-income countries – especially the poorest – the damage is even larger: in about one-third of these countries, per capita incomes in 2024 will remain below 2019 levels by an average of 6%.” Wars and extreme weather events linked to the climate crisis were more likely to cause distress in low-income countries than elsewhere because of scanty social safety nets. On average, the poorest countries spend just 3% of GDP on their most vulnerable citizens – compared with an average of 26% average for developing economies. In advanced economies, the Bank expects growth to weaken from 2.6% in 2022 to 0.7% this year and increase only slightly to 1.2% in 2024. The US is forecast to expand by 0.8%, twice as fast the euro area, with both economies continuing to feel the impact of higher rates. The World Bank said it would be hard for central banks to hit their inflation targets and tight monetary policy would mean slower growth. Recent runs on US regional banks were likely to lead to tighter credit conditions. “The possibility of more widespread bank turmoil and tighter monetary policy could result in even weaker global growth. Rising borrowing costs in advanced economies could lead to financial dislocations in the more vulnerable EMDEs.”",World Bank; Global economy; Business; Economics; World news; Coronavirus; Global development; Inflation,Business
2023-12-09T12:00:19Z,‘From horrible to merely bad’: will Javier Milei take his chainsaw to the environment in Argentina?,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/dec/09/from-horrible-to-merely-bad-will-javier-milei-take-his-chainsaw-to-the-environment-in-argentina,"With days to go until the inauguration of Argentina’s new president, Javier Milei, the current minister for the environment and sustainable development, Juan Cabandié, who will be leaving the government alongside the current president, Alberto Fernández, is still waiting for a call from the president-elect’s team to organise the transfer of power. “We still haven’t received any contact about how the transition will take place,” Cabandié tells the Guardian. The reason is simple: environment is one of the ministries that will cease to exist with the inauguration on 10 December since the newly elected far-right president has promised to reduce his ministerial cabinet from 18 to eight portfolios – eliminating those that “are not a priority”. A climate change denier, Milei has promised not to comply with the 2030 agenda – which is centred on 17 sustainable development goals – and to withdraw from the Paris agreement because he will not accept “impositions from outside”. He says his government will not have policies to fight the climate crisis, protect Indigenous people, or decrease deforestation, nor to sustainably regulate the production of the shale oil and gas reserve of Vaca Muerta, seen in Argentina as a golden goose. But in recent weeks, there have been signs of a possible softening of the rhetoric as Milei prepares to take office in Casa Rosada on Sunday. Nature defenders in Argentina and Latin America are watching to see if he will implement his destructive environmental agenda, as his Brazilian ideological partner, Jair Bolsonaro, did in Brazil between 2018 and 2022, or whether he will moderate his tone. Here are five key areas of concern highlighted by politicians, analysts and environmentalists. 1 Deforestation and sustainable agriculture Currently, 75% of deforestation in Argentina is concentrated in the provinces of Salta, Santiago del Estero, Chaco and Formosa due to the expansion of soya bean cultivation and cattle farming, Argentina’s main export products. After a national forest law was enacted in 2007 to regulate which areas should be protected, set limits on deforestation, and consider lands inhabited by Indigenous people, the deforestation rate decreased from 0.94% to 0.34% until 2015. But the relative early success of the legislation was short-lived, and since 2016 the deforestation rate has risen, reaching 0.42% in 2018 – a loss of 180,000 hectares (445,000 acres). Cabandié says the penalties for those who break the law are too low to deter illegal loggers, who don’t mind paying. Moreover, they are often not charged. Greenpeace reported that in Chaco province, in 2021, 18,000 hectares (44,500 acres) of native forest were destroyed despite the ban by the provincial court. As a member of the outgoing government, Cabandié holds up his hands: “There is no good oversight and not even an environmental justice structure to regulate this destruction,” he admits. Sociologist and environmentalist Maristella Svampa says: “If environmental justice is not enforced, deforestation, human-sparked fires and the displacement of the Indigenous people living there to unhealthy areas will increase.” However, moderate voices in Milei’s entourage argue that in 2023, the country lost $20bn due to the drought that devastated soya bean and corn crops for export. Milei wants to sign new free-trade deals to compensate for the losses, so green countermeasures will be demanded by trading partners. Diego Guelar, a diplomat and former Argentine ambassador to China, says: “The truth is we need money from outside, and he knows it.” Such arguments appear to have led Milei to rethink and step back from his total lack of interest in the environment. “It seems we are going from the horrible to the merely bad,” says Guelar. Milei has yet to confirm the appointment of an undersecretary of the environment focused on agricultural matters. 2 Oil and gas Fossil fuels account for 88% of the energy produced in Argentina. According to official data, the energy sector is the most significant contributor to the climate crisis, responsible for more than 50% of the country’s emissions. Like the outgoing government, the new administration sees the energy sector as key to solving the country’s economic crisis. Fossil fuels are considered the best short-term solution. According to the manifesto of Milei’s party, La Libertad Avanza, investments in oil and gas will be maintained. Vaca Muerta, the country’s main reserve in Neuquén province, will remain at the heart of Argentine energy policy. Milei aims to “generate income in foreign currency” through fossil fuel exports. Milei has promised to privatise the energy sector, including YPF, the national oil company brought under state control in 2012 during Cristina Kirchner’s centre-left government. Svampa warns of environmental problems ahead. “Vaca Muerta covers the whole province of Neuquén, but also the south of Mendoza, the south of La Pampa and part of the upper Rio Negro valley. And it’s all fracking.” The Vaca Muerta field has been controlled by transnational companies conducting large-scale fracking since 2012. Production increases have caused seismic activity and difficulties for local communities. Milei’s manifesto doesn’t mention using wind power or other clean, renewable energy sources. 3 Lithium in Jujuy Argentina’s lithium reserves are key to the Milei government’s development strategy as the metal is vital for the electronics, technology and electric vehicle industries. The northern province of Jujuy is located in the “lithium triangle”, straddling the border area between Argentina, Bolivia and Chile, which contains the world’s largest reserves of the metal. Milei has always advocated lithium mining without any reference to mitigating environmental damage. Patricia Bullrich, who ran against Milei in the presidential race but is now his ally and security minister, supports sustainable exploitation by adopting new conservation standards. Environment defenders hope she can influence the president on this issue. Pía Marchegiani, director of environmental policy at the Environment &amp; Natural Resources Foundation (Farn), says lithium mining brings three key problems to Argentina: “The impact on salt flats in the region and neighbouring countries; the changes to the water system used in mining that affect local communities; and the exclusion of those communities from decision making.” Marchegiani says “lithium fever is ravaging wetlands” and local communities do not want to be left behind and want to have a say in the energy transition. “We have to carry out the transition to reduce energy costs, not so that a family in Europe can have three electric cars.” 4 Indigenous peoples Argentina is home to an Indigenous population of almost 1 million people, some of whom are more threatened than others. The Wichí people, an Indigenous group living on Argentina’s northern border with Bolivia, are being displaced from their lands due to the expansion of soya bean farms, and forced to relocate to areas with limited access to water, arable land and education. The Mapuche people, who live in the southern region and are linked to the more populous Chilean Mapuche, suffer similar problems. They are often forcibly removed from their lands by mining companies and face prejudice and repression when they protest. However, the fight for Indigenous rights is nothing new in Argentina. During the administration of Mauricio Macri in 2017, Santiago Maldonado, an ally of the Mapuche people, died after a protest was shut down by police, and Rafael Nahuel, a member of the Mapuche, was shot when resisting the eviction of his community in Villa Mascardi, in Río Negro province. In an aggressive move, Bullrich, while campaigning for the presidency, proposed the deployment of the army to address such escalating tensions. Alejo de Risio, an expert in environmental law at the Ecosocial Justice Action Collective, is concerned about the effects of mining and oil exploitation on Indigenous peoples. “The big problem is that there is a race for natural goods in Argentina, and the Indigenous people are those who are found in these territories,” he says. “We can expect a very hard time for them.” Argentina has a National Institute for Indigenous Affairs, but it is among the institutions that Milei plans to abolish. 5 Paris agreement It is unclear what will happen regarding the Paris agreement when Milei takes office. Initially, he rejected participating in and accepting the 2030 agenda. However, changes have been under way in recent weeks as negotiations with coalition partners and ministries have progressed. These talks could affect the eventual makeup of Milei’s policy platform. Political analysts believe he may reconsider withdrawing from the Paris agreement and abandoning the 2030 agenda.",Global development; Javier Milei; Argentina; Environment; Indigenous peoples; Deforestation; Americas; Trees and forests; World news,Global development
2023-09-18T23:01:41Z,‘It breaks my heart’: Leah Williamson to speak at UN about Syrian refugees | Suzanne Wrack,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/19/leah-williamson-england-arsenal-united-nations-syrian-refugees,"When the Arsenal and England centre-back Leah Williamson steps up to speak at the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals summit on Tuesday she will feel a very different level of scrutiny to the pressure she feels when she steps out on to the pitch. “Head up, face forward, don’t drop your Ts,” she says with a grin beforehand. Williamson is the first England women’s national team player to take the stage at the UN, and it’s an opportunity that may not have come around had the anterior cruciate ligament injury she sustained in April and which ruled her out of the World Cup not afforded her the time to visit the Za’atari refugee camp in Jordan, the largest Syrian refugee camp in the world. That is where Williamson travelled to in August, visiting the joint initiative of Save the Children and the Arsenal Foundation that gives girls in the camp the chance to engage with a variety of programmes through football. “I’ve been speaking about going to Jordan for a while now,” Williamson says from her New York hotel room. “They’ve been on the radar. I’ve worked with the foundation, and obviously been involved in the Coaching for Life programme they run for a while now. “So, as soon as I got injured, the way I sat down to deal with it – because it’s ultimately just a slog and you enter into it to come out the other side – was I planned out everything. We looked at when I needed to take rests, then we planned these trips around that. So it’s been great to be able to tick boxes that I wanted to do, but also give back in a way like that as well.” When Williamson finally gets back on the pitch, the desire is to keep a balance that allows the 26-year-old to do more of the community and foundation work. “When you’re injured you demonstrate to yourself that there is a balance to be found,” the England captain says. “But it’s all about performance, it’s about being ready every day. You can do it [find that balance], but with the scheduling of games it makes it so much harder. So, not that I would ever be happy to be injured, but this time and these experiences and giving back is important.” Hearing about the lives of the girls they work with can be tough. “I find it really hard,” Williamson says. “Because naturally, in the world, when somebody tells you a problem you want to try and help fix it – and it’s obviously not as simple as that. The hardest moments were talking with parents in some of the sessions aimed at helping them understand why their daughters should be allowed to participate in sport. “It started off as a really great conversation, just listening to their views on how it’s changed for them, and how much they love their daughters being involved. Then, one of the fathers basically said because they have this confidence now and they’re making their way in the world, then maybe he has to leave to seek an opportunity for them. We all know what leaving a refugee camp means, the risk to life, the travelling, potentially across the sea. “It hit me, because they have these dreams but ultimately circumstance and the lottery of birthplaces has set them back compared to us. It breaks my heart every time because none of us know what comes next for them.” Williamson is used to telling girls to follow their dreams and to find their passion, but she can’t say these things in the Za’atari camp. “You can’t say to a kid: ‘Just dream as big as you want to.’ I can’t provide that reassurance for them, which is hard.” Football camps there cannot provide a certain future, but it can provide a sense of escape. “That is universal,” Williamson says. “When I step on a pitch, no matter what I think about beforehand, as soon as I step on that pitch it all goes away. It’s not a conscious effort, it just takes all your worries away and all your thoughts. And I think, for them, that is obviously just a massive, massive thing, especially combined with the resilience sessions that they do.” Williamson is used to speaking out – she was part of the England team that won the Euros last year and then demanded equal access to sport for boys and girls in schools. While she embraces being outspoken and an activist, she gets frustrated with the conversations around it. “People will say: ‘Bore off with your activism,’ or: ‘Just play the game.’ I’m like: ‘This is life. It’s life and it’s the conversations of life and real circumstances. There’s no story, there’s no drama, it is black and white: this is the way we’re treated, and this is the way that we should be treated, and the majority of the population agree with us.’ “We still have a situations, like we do in Za’atari, with a refugee camp filled with people fleeing war. So when people talk to me about it I just think: ‘Why does everybody not want to live in a better world? Why would you not contribute to it if you could?’ That’s why I’m uncomfortable with the way the word activism is used, because I think it’s just how normal people should behave.” Seeing the struggles of the girls in the Za’atari camp puts challenges back home in perspective too. “When people say ‘no’ to me here, now I think: ‘No? Really?’ Because if we can do it there, we can do it here,” Williamson says. “There is no reason to stop us here, it’s just an opinion or somebody that doesn’t agree, instead of actual barriers, like not having a home. I try not to compare it because that would drive me insane, or I’d feel even more useless. “But in terms of trying to change for the better, I’m like: ‘You’re going to need to give me a better reason than “no” now because when I asked for something that I think is worthy, it’s achievable. I know it is.’”",Leah Williamson; England women's football team; Women's football; Football; Sport,Football
2023-04-14T12:45:12Z,IMF calls for ‘another Gleneagles moment’ on debt relief and aid,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/14/imf-gleneagles-moment-debt-relief-aid-package-africa-funding-squeeze,"Western countries need to put together a debt relief and aid package to match that of the landmark Gleneagles summit deal in 2005 in order to counter a severe funding squeeze affecting struggling African countries, the International Monetary Fund has said. Abebe Selassie, the director of the IMF’s African department, said without a scaling up of financial support some of the world’s poorest countries would have no chance of meeting the 2030 UN goals for poverty reduction. “We need another Gleneagles moment,” he said in an interview with the Guardian before the release of the IMF report on the state of countries in sub-Saharan Africa. At the Gleneagles summit 18 years ago, the G8 group on industrialised countries agreed to double aid to Africa and announced a comprehensive package of debt relief. Selassie said something similar was now required. The IMF official said that even before the pandemic it looked like a “tall order” for low-income countries in Africa to meet the UN’s 2030 sustainable development goals. Now recent shocks – Covid 19, higher inflation and the war in Ukraine – had made the situation “very difficult”. Selassie added that countries needed help not just to alleviate poverty but to meet the challenge of global heating. “The inexorable logic of climate change is beginning to affect the region,” he said. “Nobody expected the series of shocks seen in recent years.” The IMF expects annual growth in sub-Saharan Africa to slow from 4.2% to 3.6% this year, as its countries suffer a “big funding squeeze” tied to the drying up of aid and being frozen out of global capital markets. Selassie said: “The effect of the pandemic was to push countries into a clearly unsustainable financial position in some cases, such as Chad and Zambia.” Unless a way was found to counter the funding squeeze, countries that were experiencing cashflow problems would “clearly be facing more serious solvency challenges”, he added. The sharp increase in global interest rates had raised borrowing costs for sub-Saharan African countries, on domestic and international markets. Moreover, higher US interest rates had pushed the effective exchange rate for the dollar to its highest level in two decades last year. This increased the burden of dollar-denominated debt service payments. Interest payments as a share of revenue had doubled for the average country in the region over the past decade. The IMF said it had scaled up its financial help since the pandemic began three years ago. Between 2020 and 2022 the Washington-based organisation provided more than $50bn (£40bn) to the region, more than twice the amount disbursed in any 10-year period since the 1990s. But Selassie said wealthy developed countries also needed to do more. “I refuse to believe the international community can’t do more. If it doesn’t it will be shortsightedness of the highest order.”",Debt relief; Aid; International Monetary Fund (IMF); Africa; Economics; Society; World news; Global development; Business,World news
2023-09-29T11:19:21Z,We have all felt powerless as poverty mounts in Tory Britain. Here is a practical way to hold back the tide | Polly Toynbee,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/sep/29/poverty-tory-britain-essential-bills-social-tariff-covid-universal-credit,"Winter is coming, and it will be harsher. People in “negative income”, whose incomings don’t cover their bills, are about to be hit even harder. Better economic news on “falling inflation” is a mirage when bills keep on rising. Citizens Advice and the Social Market Foundation are this week calling for social tariffs – cheaper packages on essential bills for those on benefits – to stop millions more households sinking under debts and evictions. Social tariffs are only a second best, they admit, to people having adequate incomes in the first place. No chance of that, with speculation that benefits may not rise next April with inflation. The rise traditionally follows September’s inflation rate. But that’s not set in law: there have been four savage years of freezes (2016-2020). Chit-chat around the Torysphere suggests if inflation has fallen further by next April then that should be the rate, not this September’s. But that time lag was never taken into account when inflation was rising, so benefits never kept up. The Treasury saves £1.4bn for every 1% benefits drop below inflation, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Since 2010 the real value of unemployment benefits, cut again and again by George Osborne and Iain Duncan Smith, fell by 9%; for a family of three children the drop could have been three times as much. Adam Corlett of the Resolution Foundation, with a new report on rising poverty, rightly says many have forgotten the long-ago day in 2015 when David Cameron signed the UN’s sustainable development goals with a rousing commitment that included pledging Britain and all rich countries to halve their own poverty levels by 2030. Corlett’s report, Half Time, finds that ambition will be missed by a country mile. Halving our poverty level would mean 5.9 million fewer people in poverty; instead he predicts that in 2024-25 alone another 300,000 will fall below the line. Rishi Sunak, in his great bonfire of “unachievable” projects and targets, from HS2 to net zero, can add this one, though he probably never even noticed it was there. I’ll stop here for a moment, as I fear many Guardian readers will. We know all this, however many reports send up flares with new analyses. It’s always worse than we thought, and getting worse still. My heart sinks and my fingers freeze on the keyboard, trying to find new words to write after the past wretched 13 years. A moment of light came when temporary universal credit uplift payments during the pandemic caused a sudden fall in poverty numbers. When that was brutally snatched back, there was a ripple of shock at finding how losing just that £20 a week tipped so many straight over the edge. You can rant, along with me, about the brutes who have done all this – and at the (mercifully shrinking) number of Tory core voters, who clamour for more of the same. You can ponder how ministers dare murmur about the abolition of inheritance tax, saving the richest 4% of estates billions that should be spent on those who need it. But what’s the point? An election is coming – and it’s as well to remind ourselves that Blair and Brown pledged to abolish child poverty by 2020. There were a million fewer children in poverty by the time they left office, and Corlett says upcoming revised estimates will show how much nearer to halfway they got by 2010 than previously realised. (For those grumbling about too few Labour promises, every Labour government always raises the living standards of those at the bottom – this one would be no different.) But for now, under this benighted government, Citizens Advice and the Social Market Foundation call for better social tariffs on life’s essentials. Energy, water, broadband and car insurance need universal rates of assistance all over the country for those who can’t afford them. There’s currently no deal for car insurance, so 1m households gave it up in the last year, hindering people’s ability to get to work, or even to get a job. With broadband, a few companies have offers of packages but with differing elegibility, so only 5% of the low- paid take these up. More than 4 million people (8%) had to stop spending on mobile, broadband or insurance in 2022, leaving them isolated. Nearly 40% of those on universal credit have cut back or switched off broadband, unable to pay bills, so they have to queue at libraries (if they’ve still got one) to report their incomes to the Department for Work and Pensions each month, which can only be done online. The next question is how these social tariffs should be structured and funded, to ensure high uptake and to end postcode lotteries. Options could include a fixed discount, not paid for by the state but by a levy on all utilities companies, a system that would work for car insurance too. Utilities companies complain some areas have many more low-income people claiming a social tariff, leaving them unfairly out of pocket. That’s why it needs government to impose pooled risk so all companies pay a levy and all offer the same vouchers. Citizens Advice warns that half those coming to them in debt are in a negative budget: “Their bills are still more than their income, when we’ve done everything to cut their spending and lift their income,” Nicola Lyons of County Durham Citizens Advice says. They’re under so much pressure that unless the matter is urgent, there’s a three-week wait for face-to-face interviews with one of their debt or benefit advisers. The day I spoke to her, she had just been trying to help a family in direst straits: a single mother’s three children have been sent home from their school, which is collapsing under Raac, so she’s trying to work from home. They have one laptop, one mobile phone and very weak, slow wifi, with which she has to do her job and the children their online lessons and homework. They get no free school meals now they’re home, and they can’t cover their bills and buy enough food. And there is no answer to their predicament. In the words of Martin Lewis, the great money-saving expert, when “there’s nothing left in the cupboard that I can help you with … that means it has to be a political solution”. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",UK cost of living crisis; Poverty; Energy bills; Money; Inflation; Social exclusion; Politics; Society,Opinion
2023-12-03T10:33:31Z,Cop28 president says there is ‘no science’ behind demands for phase-out of fossil fuels,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/03/back-into-caves-cop28-president-dismisses-phase-out-of-fossil-fuels,"The president of Cop28, Sultan Al Jaber, has claimed there is “no science” indicating that a phase-out of fossil fuels is needed to restrict global heating to 1.5C, the Guardian and the Centre for Climate Reporting can reveal. Al Jaber also said a phase-out of fossil fuels would not allow sustainable development “unless you want to take the world back into caves”. The comments were “incredibly concerning” and “verging on climate denial”, scientists said, and they were at odds with the position of the UN secretary general, António Guterres. Al Jaber made the comments in ill-tempered responses to questions from Mary Robinson, the chair of the Elders group and a former UN special envoy for climate change, during a live online event on 21 November. As well as running Cop28 in Dubai, Al Jaber is also the chief executive of the United Arab Emirates’ state oil company, Adnoc, which many observers see as a serious conflict of interest. More than 100 countries already support a phase-out of fossil fuels and whether the final Cop28 agreement calls for this or uses weaker language such as “phase-down” is one of the most fiercely fought issues at the summit and may be the key determinant of its success. Deep and rapid cuts are needed to bring fossil fuel emissions to zero and limit fast-worsening climate impacts. Al Jaber spoke with Robinson at a She Changes Climate event. Robinson said: “We’re in an absolute crisis that is hurting women and children more than anyone … and it’s because we have not yet committed to phasing out fossil fuel. That is the one decision that Cop28 can take and in many ways, because you’re head of Adnoc, you could actually take it with more credibility.” Al Jaber said: “I accepted to come to this meeting to have a sober and mature conversation. I’m not in any way signing up to any discussion that is alarmist. There is no science out there, or no scenario out there, that says that the phase-out of fossil fuel is what’s going to achieve 1.5C.” Robinson challenged him further, saying: “I read that your company is investing in a lot more fossil fuel in the future.” Al Jaber responded: “You’re reading your own media, which is biased and wrong. I am telling you I am the man in charge.” Al Jaber then said: “Please help me, show me the roadmap for a phase-out of fossil fuel that will allow for sustainable socioeconomic development, unless you want to take the world back into caves.” “I don’t think [you] will be able to help solve the climate problem by pointing fingers or contributing to the polarisation and the divide that is already happening in the world. Show me the solutions. Stop the pointing of fingers. Stop it,” Al Jaber said. Guterres told Cop28 delegates on Friday: “The science is clear: The 1.5C limit is only possible if we ultimately stop burning all fossil fuels. Not reduce, not abate. Phase out, with a clear timeframe.” Bill Hare, the chief executive of Climate Analytics, said: “This is an extraordinary, revealing, worrying and belligerent exchange. ‘Sending us back to caves’ is the oldest of fossil fuel industry tropes: it’s verging on climate denial.” “Al Jaber is asking for a 1.5C roadmap – anyone who cares can find that in the International Energy Agency’s latest net zero emissions scenario, which says there cannot be any new fossil fuel development. The science is absolutely clear [and] that absolutely means a phase-out by mid-century, which will enhance the lives of all of humanity.” Prof Sir David King, the chair of the Climate Crisis Advisory Group and a former UK chief scientific adviser, said: “It is incredibly concerning and surprising to hear the Cop28 president defend the use of fossil fuels. It is undeniable that to limit global warming to 1.5C we must all rapidly reduce carbon emissions and phase-out the use of fossil fuels by 2035 at the latest. The alternative is an unmanageable future for humanity.” Dr Friederike Otto, of Imperial College London, UK, said: “The science of climate change has been clear for decades: we need to stop burning fossil fuels. A failure to phase out fossil fuels at Cop28 will put several millions more vulnerable people in the firing line of climate change. This would be a terrible legacy for Cop28.” Otto also rejected the claim that fossil fuels were necessary for development in poorer countries, saying that the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change “shows that the UN’s sustainable development goals are not achievable by continuing the current fossil-driven high emission economies. [There are] massive co-benefits that come with changing to a fossil-free world”. A spokesperson for Cop28 said: “The IEA and IPCC 1.5C scenarios clearly state that fossil fuels will have to play a role in the future energy system, albeit a smaller one. The Cop president was quoting the science, and leading climate experts. “He has clearly said that the oil and gas industry must tackle scope 1 and 2 emissions [from their operations], must invest in clean energy and clean technologies to address scope 3 emissions [from burning fuels], and that all industry must align around keeping the north star of 1.5C within reach. “Once again, this is clearly part of a continued effort to undermine the Cop presidency’s tangible achievements and a misrepresentation of our position and successes to date.” The spokesperson said the presidency had operationalised the loss and damage fund with more than $700m, launched a $30bn private market climate vehicle, and brought 51 oil companies to agree decarbonisation targets and 119 countries to sign a pledge to triple renewable energy. “This is just the beginning,” the spokesperson said. Al Jaber is also head of Masdar, the UAE’s renewable energy company, but his appointment as Cop28 president has been controversial. Shortly before the summit, leaked documents showed that the UAE had planned to use climate meetings with governments to promote oil and gas deals. Al Jaber denied having seen or used the talking points in the documents. Adnoc also has the largest net-zero-busting expansion plans for oil and gas, according to independent analysis. The issue of a phase-out or phase-down is complicated by the terms not having agreed definitions and by the highly uncertain role of technologies to “abate” emissions, such as carbon capture and storage. “Keeping the Paris agreement targets alive will require a full fossil fuel phase-out, not a vague phase-down relying on unproven technologies,” said Otto. More than 100 African, European, Pacific and Caribbean countries back a phase-out of unabated fossil fuels. The US, the world’s biggest oil and gas producer, also backs a phase-out. Others, such as Russia, Saudi Arabia and China, reject the call. Both options are on the table at Cop28, as well as proposals to only mention coal, or to not say anything at all about fossil fuels. Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021 agreed for the first time to “phase down” coal use, but this had been watered down from “phase out” at the last minute, bringing the Cop26 president, Alok Sharma, to tears. In his conversation with Robinson, Al Jaber also said: “A phase-down and a phase-out of fossil fuel in my view is inevitable. That is essential. But we need to be real serious and pragmatic about it.” “Hold on. Let me just explain,” he said. “The world will continue to need energy sources. We [UAE] are the only ones in the world today that have been decarbonising the oil and gas resources. We have the lowest carbon intensity.” This refers to the emissions from the energy used to extract fossil fuels, not the far larger emissions from burning the fuels. “There is no such thing as ‘low carbon’ or ‘lower carbon’ oil and gas,” said Otto. Numerous commentators have said that negative or embarrassing revelations about Al Jaber and Adnoc increase the pressure on him to deliver a strong Cop28 deal. The Guardian reported recently that state-run UAE oil and gas fields had been flaring gas almost daily despite having committed 20 years ago to a policy of zero routine flaring. The Guardian previously reported that Adnoc had been able to read emails to and from the Cop28 office until the Guardian raised the issue in June and that the UAE had also failed to report its oil industry’s emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas methane. Harjeet Singh, at Climate Action Network, said: “Cop28 must deliver a decision on phasing out fossil fuels in a just and equitable manner, without any loopholes or escape routes for the industry to continue expanding and exacerbating the climate crisis.” • Cop28: Can fossil fuel companies transition to clean energy? On Tuesday 5 December, 8pm-9.15pm GMT, join Damian Carrington, Christiana Figueres, Tessa Khan and Mike Coffin for a livestreamed discussion on whether fossil fuel companies can transition to clean energy.

2023-07-23T09:25:23Z,It won’t cost much to make free school meals a universal right | Larry Elliott,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/23/it-wont-cost-much-to-make-free-school-meals-a-universal-right,"During the pandemic the Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford turned food into a hot political issue in the UK with his campaign for every child in a low-income family to be guaranteed a free school meal. Since then, things have moved on. The problems facing low-income families – not just in Britain but everywhere – have worsened owing to rising global food prices. Consumers in the western economies have seen the cost of their weekly shop rise sharply. Food bank use in Britain has surged as a result of a cost-of-living crisis that has seen grocery bills rise by almost a fifth in the past year. Simultaneously, a growing number of countries are now campaigning vigorously on the issue identified by Rashford. The School Meals Coalition is pushing for universal access to free school meals by 2030 as a response to rising hunger. Governments in Bangladesh, Benin, Kenya, Nepal, Rwanda, Senegal and many other countries have set their sights on providing school meals to all children. World leaders, such as Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, are supporters of the campaign. A UN food summit in Rome starting on Monday will be presented with a proposal by the Sustainable Financing Initiative for School Health and Nutrition for a $6bn-a-year (£4.6bn) scheme to extend free school meals to low-income countries where the need is greatest and current provision is weakest. Those arguing for an expansion of free school meals say something is going seriously wrong with the global food system – and they are right. Enough is produced to feed a rising population yet hunger and obesity are on the rise. The social and environmental costs of the way food is produced are enormous. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has made a bad situation worse. Many deprived countries rely heavily on imports from Ukraine and were the main beneficiaries of the deal brokered by Turkey last year that allowed grain, oilseed and fertiliser passage across the Black Sea. That agreement has now been ended by the Kremlin, with an immediate impact on food prices in the commodity markets. It is the countries of sub-Saharan Africa, which import about 40% of their cereals, that have most to lose. Ukraine grows about 10% of the world’s wheat and 15% of its corn, and much of the produce is exported to low-income countries already struggling with political instability and the impact of the climate crisis. But the world food system would be in crisis even were the war in Ukraine to end overnight. The UN knows that, as does the World Bank. Some might wonder what all the fuss is about because from one perspective the global food system is an example of innovation at its best. Back in the late 18th century, the economist Thomas Malthus warned that population growth would outstrip food production, leading to hunger and misery, but those fears have proved unfounded, at least until now. In the past 225 years since Malthus first expounded his theory, higher agricultural productivity has meant the production of food has outpaced population growth, leading to better nutrition, lower levels of poverty and longer lives. Measured by yields a hectare, agricultural productivity continues to grow. The climate emergency could yet prove Malthus right, of course. The proposal prepared for the Rome summit says the increase in agricultural yields masks four big failures: about 3 billion people don’t have enough to eat; unhealthy diets are leading to premature deaths and have resulted in a global obesity rate of 13%; intensive agriculture is causing ecological damage, with the food system accounting for a third of greenhouse gases; and many of the world’s poorest people live in rural areas in a state of permanent food insecurity. “The way we produce, consume, distribute and market food is damaging nature, fuelling public health crises and driving us towards climate catastrophe. If we are to make progress towards the world envisaged by the (2030 UN) Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on climate, we need to reset the global food system,” it argues. There are many problems with the global food system. The increased prevalence of extreme weather events, commodity speculation and conflict all play a part and it would be naive to imagine that free school meals for all children of school age represent a magic bullet. That said, they would be a practical solution to a very real issue. As Rashford so compellingly argued, giving a child at least one guaranteed square meal a day alleviates hunger, makes learning easier and improves health. School meal programmes can also be used to procure local produce, making food systems more sustainable. Progress towards eradicating hunger has stalled over the past decade and as things stand the prevalence of undernutrition in 2030 will be the same as in 2015. Almost 300 million children of primary and secondary school age are either sitting in classrooms hungry or are not in school at all. In the UK, incidentally, there are 1.7 million children in households in receipt of universal credit who are ineligible for school meals. For the scheme to work, rich countries would find about one-third of the $6bn annual cost, with the rest found by the governments of low-income countries through their budgets or though innovative financing ideas such as debt for school meals swaps, under which countries would channel the savings from debt relief into school meals programmes. At a time when aid budgets are being cut, $2bn a year is small change for donor governments and represents just one day’s worth of annual subsidies to food producers. It is a small price to pay for something that could do so much good.",School meals; Food poverty; Food; Food & drink industry; Global development; United Nations; Education; Business; Environment; Schools; World news; Society; Economics; Marcus Rashford; Poverty; Aid; Commodities,Business
2023-03-29T17:45:55Z,The Guardian view on a water crisis: targets need to be binding | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/29/the-guardian-view-on-a-water-crisis-targets-need-to-be-binding,"The more than 700 pledges that emerged from the UN water conference, which concluded last weekend, were an insufficient response to the worsening global water crisis. But the scientific panel that the UN has committed to create, along with a new water envoy, should help bring greater clarity and raise awareness of the multiplying risks. These include sea level rises, floods, droughts and other extreme weather caused by global heating, and the lack of access of about 2 billion people to clean drinking water. The trouble is that the commitments made by attenders – who included very few world leaders – are voluntary and unenforceable. Given the broken climate pledges of the past, there is every reason to worry that the promises will not be kept. Many participants in the three days of talks in New York were angered by the prominent role played by corporations, including manufacturers who are heavy users of water, and the lack of representation of grassroots organisations from the poorer countries that are the worst affected. As with recent reports of the influence of oil companies in US universities, there are growing concerns about the ways in which businesses are seeking to shape environmental legislation, and public understanding of the threats, to promote their own short-term economic interests. Nonetheless, the UN’s first major conference on water since 1977 was a reminder that scarce resources must not be taken for granted. António Guterres, the UN secretary-general, warned that it is “making our planet uninhabitable” and that “vampiric overconsumption” must stop. Last year’s drought in Somalia, which is estimated to have caused 43,000 excess deaths, and floods in Pakistan, are grim foretastes of what lies ahead. About 10% of the global rise in migration is linked to water shortages, and armed conflict linked to competition for water is also increasing. There are good reasons why dangerous heat tends to be the focus when we think about the climate emergency. Rising temperatures caused by greenhouse gases are the central problem – and one which continues to become more dangerous as emissions keep rising. But limiting emissions is only one part of the solution to an emergency that is certain to get worse, even if we eventually succeed in preventing the most catastrophic outcomes. Rising sea levels are the urgent priority of low-lying and island nations that could disappear under the waves. Food production and energy generation are both highly water-intensive. The last century of development saw freshwater withdrawal rates rise almost sixfold. Now it is poorer nations driving demand. Yet a quarter of the world’s population still does not have access to safe drinking water, while half lacks basic sanitation – which is one of the sustainable development goals for 2030. Belatedly, the need to improve water governance, and ensure fairer distribution as well as conservation, is on the wider environmental agenda. But, as with every aspect of the climate crisis, the response lags behind reality. The continuing trend towards privatisation of water supplies is concerning, as is the lack of financial transfers from rich countries. There was some good news: a UN report released just before the conference noted that, globally, water use efficiency had risen by 9% from 2015 to 2018. Richard Connor, the report’s author, warned that “binding agreements” were needed, rather than setting global targets that could be ignored and hence never reached. On current performance, Mr Connor looks to be right.",Water; United Nations; Environment; Drought; Sea level; Somalia; Pakistan; Sanitation; Global development; World news,Opinion
2023-04-27T14:05:53Z,"Britain leaving ECHR would be ‘catastrophic’, says development minister",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/27/britain-leaving-echr-would-be-catastrophic-says-development-minister,"The UK’s departure from the European convention on human rights would be catastrophic and is extremely unlikely, the development minister, Andrew Mitchell, has said as he launched plans designed to show that the UK is back as a global leader on development. His remarks put him at odds with those in the cabinet who have said they are prepared for the UK to leave the ECHR if it is necessary to push through plans to send refugees arriving in the UK on boats to countries such as Rwanda. Speaking at Chatham House, Mitchell said: “I don’t think there’s any question of Britain leaving the ECHR, the prime minister I think has made that pretty clear.” He said he accepted that the UK was willing to test the limits of what was possible under the ECHR, but added: “I think that leaving the ECHR is incredibly unlikely to happen. It was built by British ministers and British lawyers after the second world war. It is extremely important and you can imagine the effect of Britain withdrawing, what it would be on other countries with malign intent who would also feel they could withdraw. “It would be a huge thread pulled out of the international system, which is already on the back foot … with catastrophic effect.” He said the prime minister had drilled into the details and radically improved the relationship with France, a precondition of solving the boats issue. He said no democratic government could expect to get re-elected when people were coming across on boats “in an arbitrary and unstructured way”. He has previously said there are currently no safe routes for asylum seekers to come to the UK. In a wide-ranging speech setting a sharply different tone from some of his ministerial colleagues, Mitchell also described as appalling what was happening in the US to roll back women’s rights, a reference to the recent US supreme court judgment on abortion. He said: “It is a time when crises are everywhere but leadership is not, when we can save a bank in three days but Zambia waits for more than two years for debt relief, when our children can secure mortgage finance for 30 years but developing countries secure maturities in just over five years.” He said anger in the global south was rising as it saw “a developed world can invent quantitative easing to find money for themselves, but cannot find money to save the planet”. Mitchell said the government was minded to publish a development white paper designed to get the UK and the world back on track to meet the sustainable development goals (SDGs) for 2030. “We want a policy so that whoever wins the next general election, we have a programme that endures any change in government and which can deliver on the SDGs.” He said: “There will be an explosion of anger at the end of this year if there is no progress on this,” saying clear progress was needed on climate finance by the end of the year. “The white paper could incorporate the learning and expertise that Britain likes to champion.” He said the government was now spending 0.55% of gross national income on development, not far short of the government’s previous but currently renounced target of 0.7%. He said: “I know these cuts are painful for our partners and dented our reputation.” Britain’s development leadership “had been sorely missed across the world”, he admitted. At the same time, he pointed out that extra finance could be found by simple changes to capital adequacy reserve rules agreed at the spring World Bank meeting, a shift that released an extra $4bn a year. He said he did not believe any incoming government would want to break up the merger of the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development, saying the reaction of most people would be that they could not stomach any more structural change that would take more years to settle down. He said: “I am in the business of making the new structure work.” He said he wanted to boost public support for aid in the UK. Currently, only half of Britons support UK aid spending, but his objective is to make this rise to 70% within 10 years, as measured by a development engagement lab run by the University of London. “We must be honest and accept that we do not currently sufficiently enjoy support for our ambitious programme. I am determined we shall win over the doubters and drive up support.” Mitchell, who held the international development brief in the government led by David Cameron, said this would require taking the argument outside the capital. Mitchell accepted that 28% of the UK aid budget was being spent on housing refugees in the UK, and promised that in conjunction with the Treasury he was trying to bear down to secure value for money on this Home Office spending. He said that for the moment he had to “suck it up” but he was trying to make sure this diversion of aid spending was temporary. He said: “I know a lot of money is being spent on bedsits in Bedford and not in Africa,” but he added that this spending was legitimate under the OECD rules, and if he tried to change the rules he could open a Pandora’s box.",Immigration and asylum; Andrew Mitchell; Human rights; European court of human rights; Law; Politics; UK news; Conservatives; Aid,UK news
2023-02-08T13:30:15Z,UK urged to sack Tony Abbott as trade adviser for joining climate sceptic group,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/08/calls-for-uk-to-sack-tony-abbott-trade-adviser-climate-sceptic-thinktank-global-warming-policy-foundation,"The UK government is being urged to sack one of its trade advisers after he joined a thinktank that has denied the scale of the climate crisis and campaigned against net zero. Tony Abbott, a former Australian prime minister, announced this week that he had joined the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF). Abbott has been a member of the UK government’s Board of Trade since 2020, advising on post-Brexit deals, with Australia now a key trading partner since the UK left the EU. But sources at the Department for Business and Trade said Abbott would not be dismissed, despite an outcry from parliamentarians and climate campaigners. The GWPF has produced reviews – at odds with mainstream science – that claim the climate emergency is not happening. Members of the thinktank have shared work suggesting that a rise in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could be a good thing. Presenting a report last year, the GWPF’s director, Dr Benny Peiser, said: “It’s extraordinary that anyone should think there is a climate crisis.” Recently, the thinktank started Net Zero Watch, a campaigning platform highlighting what it calls the “costs of net zero”. GWPF is being looked into by the Charity Commission after claims from MPs and lawyers that it does not meet its aims as a charity and is a lobbying organisation. The Guardian understands that one of the thinktank’s previous leading members, the Tory MP Steve Baker, was advised to give up his position on the board of trustees before being appointed a junior minister in the Northern Ireland Office last year. Campaigners have called for Abbott to be sacked as a trade adviser. Mel Evans, of Greenpeace UK, said: “Talking tough on climate action while filling your Board of Trade with people like Abbott is a dismal signal to the world about Britain’s climate leadership. Tony Abbott is free to continue his journey into unreality, but the government shouldn’t allow us to be dragged along behind him.” There are fears that having someone who is sceptical about reaching net zero on the Board of Trade could affect the UK’s trade deals. Shaun Spiers, the executive director of Green Alliance, said: “Ninety per cent of the world’s GDP is generated in countries that are committed to net zero. That brings lots of trading opportunities for progressive UK businesses, who will be looking to the new Department for Business and Trade for support. Meanwhile, one of its key advisers is trying to undermine support for climate action. It’s not a good look.” The Board of Trade is headed by the trade secretary, Kemi Badenoch, who has also previously questioned net zero. The Green MP, Caroline Lucas, said: “In May last year, the government claimed it was ‘leading the way on green trade’. How time flies, now that nine months later the trade department has a secretary of state who rejects net zero, and an adviser who openly supports climate denial. Our climate leadership on the world stage takes yet another pounding. “Fundamentally, all trade agreements must meet the UK’s own climate and biodiversity targets; be aligned with Paris agreement targets to limit global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees; and deliver the sustainable development goals. If government figures can’t, or won’t, deliver those objectives, they should not be in post.” The Liberal Democrat climate change spokesperson, Wera Hobhouse, said: “For Rishi Sunak to allow Tony Abbott to continue on the government’s Board of Trade tells you everything you need to know about his prioritisation of the climate crisis. A government spokesperson said: “The Board of Trade is an advisory panel who serve in personal capacities, do not speak on behalf of government and do not set government policy.” A spokesperson for the GWPF said: “Taking climate change seriously is about making sure the costs and benefits of climate policies are properly weighed up. Tony Abbott is sensitive to this concern, which is why he has joined our eminent board of trustees.” The Guardian approached Tony Abbott for comment.",Climate science scepticism and denial; Tony Abbott; Trade policy; Thinktanks; World news; Climate crisis; Australia news; UK news,Environment
2022-09-21T06:00:22Z,Better than Bulgaria but not as nice as Cuba: how did the US become such an awful place to live? | Arwa Mahdawi,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/21/us-un-living-standards-sustainable-development-goals,"What do you call a country where nearly one in 10 adults have medical debts and a broken bone can boot you into bankruptcy? A country where a city of more than 160,000 residents recently had no safe drinking water for weeks? A country where life expectancy has dropped for the second year in a row and poor people sell their blood plasma in order to make ends meet? A country where the maternal mortality rate of black women in the capital is nearly twice as high as for women in Syria? You call it one of the richest countries in the world. The US is the second-wealthiest country in the world (recently overtaken by China) when you look at national balance sheets. It’s the largest economy in the world when you look at GDP. And it’s home to some of the richest people in the world. By all those measures of progress, the US is doing great. By other measures, however, things are not quite as rosy. The UN recently demoted the US to 41st, down from 32nd, in a global ranking based on its sustainable development goals. Like everything UN-related, this index is jargony and complicated, but essentially it is focused on the quality of life of ordinary people rather than the creation of wealth. And, on this measure, the US comes just behind Cuba and just above Bulgaria. The US is “becoming a ‘developing country’,” one political historian said last week, based on this index. If you’re reading this from the other side of the Atlantic, things aren’t much better. An analysis in the Financial Times last week found that “On present trends, the average Slovenian household will be better off than its British counterpart by 2024, and the average Polish family will move ahead before the end of the decade.” Essentially, the analysis concluded, income inequality in the US and UK is so enormous that the two nations should be classed as poor countries with some very rich people. Most of whom seem to be in the government. • Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist",Poverty; Economics; US news; UK news; World news; Money; Society,Opinion
2023-11-13T13:06:06Z,BP and Spotify bought carbon credits at risk of link to forced Uyghur labour in China,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/13/carbon-credits-at-risk-of-link-to-uyghur-forced-labour-bought-by-bp-and-spotify,"BP and Spotify were among companies who bought carbon credits at risk of being implicated in potential Uyghur forced labour, an investigation has found. The credits were sourced from the Bachu carbon project, which was developed by South Pole, the world’s largest carbon consultancy. The project focussed on a biomass power plant in Xinjiang, China, which said it would lower global carbon emissions by using waste cotton stalks from nearby fields to generate electricity. South Pole, whose chief executive, Renat Heuberger, stood down on Friday, marketed credits for their employment benefits for women and minority ethnic people and support for the UN sustainable development goals, with the claims often echoed by companies that bought them to offset their carbon footprints. In the advertising literature for the Bachu project, the company said the scheme involved “local farmers who collect cotton stalks and burn them to generate carbon neutral power. This activity both creates sustainable electricity and creates an additional income stream for rural people in the project area, boosting the local economy.” But the Guardian and Follow the Money, a Dutch investigative newsroom, analysed project documents and satellite imagery of the power plant and its surrounding area, looked at leaked South Pole data and spoke to several experts on the Chinese government’s treatment of Uyghur Muslims. One of the academics spoken to by the team found potentially coercive labour transfers that involved hundreds of people at two locations within 50km (30 miles) of the project, the radius within which the project collects cotton stalks. The investigation found that South Pole was aware of the risk of forced labour linked to the scheme in 2021. South Pole did not raise its concerns with with the certification body Gold Standard, the Guardian understands. Companies that had bought the credits also said they were not alerted. South Pole said it stopped selling the credits after due diligence concerns were raised in 2021. The Guardian understands that the risk that forced labour might be linked to the project was raised by prospective clients and internally at South Pole in 2021. In South Pole’s internal system seen by the Guardian, a note says not to offer credits from the scheme to clients. It says “DON’T OFFER TO KAMs – DD issues”. KAM stands for key account managers; DD means due diligence. Credits had been sold by South Pole since 2014, according to internal sales data. Analysis of the sales figures shows that credits were bought from the Chinese partner for an average of €0.39 and sold by South Pole for an average price of €4.28 to companies trying to meet their environmental commitments, generating €657,529 in sales. This data may not be definitive. BP bought the most carbon credits from the project, according to the figures, using it as part of its 2020 portfolio for the BP Target Neutral scheme, which offers people the chance to offset their emissions from driving. BP declined to comment and still lists the project on its Target Neutral website at the time of publishing. WWF, Spotify, the tennis player Dominic Thiem, Ecologi and Hilton Hotels were among others that bought credits from the project, according to the Gold Standard registry and South Pole sales data. Not all were directly sold the credits by South Pole. WWF and Ecologi stopped supporting the scheme in 2019, Spotify in 2020, they told the Guardian. Thiem and Hilton Hotels did not respond to questions. In a statement responding to the investigation’s findings, South Pole said: “We have never owned or managed this project on the ground so our ability to gather real-time and granular information was relatively limited. “When a client expressed a concern about the potential for labour issues at this project we launched a specific review of the situation. Our review could not identify any material issues of concern, but we remained generally uncomfortable about unrelated media reporting on the allegations of forced labour in Xinjiang. As a result we took a prudent decision to halt the sale of carbon credits from this project in 2021.” Gold Standard said it appreciated “the scrutiny that investigative journalism can bring”, and welcomed “contributions that help the voluntary carbon market improve and deliver on its potential to drive change where it matters most”. It confirmed that South Pole had not raised concerns about Bachu with it at any point. The power company that runs the plant did not respond to questions. Bachu, a power plant on which construction began in 2008, is situated in Kashgar prefecture in Xinjiang in north-west China. It burns biomass – mostly cotton stalks and wood from the surrounding area in straw boilers – to generate electricity that feeds into the Chinese grid. Concerns about forced Uyghur labour in Xinjiang have been raised around the world in recent years. The UN estimates that about one million people have been housed in detention camps used to oppress Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities that differ from the Han majority since 2017. Experts say forced labour of Uyghurs and forced land transfers are common, often linked to the agricultural industry, including the cotton sector. Open source analysis of satellite footage of the area around the plant uncovered a fortified facility in the same region that has been linked by researchers to the mass detention of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang. There is no evidence this facility is linked to the cotton industry or to Bachu biomass facility. The Guardian asked Adrian Zenz, a German academic who is one of the foremost experts on forced labour in Xinjiang’s cotton picking industry, to analyse government propaganda and news reports on the region. Zenz, who has had three papers on forced labour published in peer reviewed journals this year alone, found evidence of two farms involved in potentially coercive labour transfers within the 50km radius of the project since 2011. One farm had been named in two different local news reports about labour relocations. The first, in 2016, described how cadres had identified 400 people capable of picking cotton in a village and mobilised them to a number of destinations including the farm in question. In the second, in 2018, 930 people were relocated to the same farm. Another farm within the 50km radius of the biomass facility had been named in a 2020 news report as the destination, in this case, of 345 villagers who were being organised to pick cotton. It is impossible to independently verify the reports on the ground due to safety concerns, or to determine whether these farms supplied the plant. The power company did not reply to our questions over how it sourced its material. Zenz said the news reports, which have been widely used by experts as evidence for forced labour in Xinjiang, indicated the area was at a high risk. This claim and the news reports have been checked with other experts on the Chinese government’s treatment of Uyghur Muslims. “You can’t find a more risky spot in Xinjiang. There’s probably no way you find a more risky spot for state-imposed forced labour in the world than this location,” he told the Guardian. “This is a systemic situation. The fact that we only have a couple of examples within the 50km radius, somebody could say: ‘Oh, there’s only a couple.’ But I think it’s symptomatic of what we’re looking at here … So often with state enforced labour, it’s not possible to link a specific batch of a product to a particular coercive labour mobilisation. And the reason that you can’t do that is because the state doesn’t provide or disclose information, you can’t go there and audit it. You can’t ask Uyghurs because if they don’t say the right thing, they end up in a camp.” Responding to the reports of potentially coerced labour transfers, Darren Byler, an American anthropologist who specialises in the treatment of Uyghurs by the Chinese government, said: “In general, cotton and textiles is one of the primary industries where assigned or unfree labour is utilised in Xinjiang. “There’s no means of resisting, especially in this context, where any sort of resistance to government intervention or management when it comes to what they call poverty alleviation is a sign of resistance and can result in you being detained. Almost everyone in these areas knows people that have been detained, maybe their own family members. So that threat is really ubiquitous,” he said. The Chinese government says that labour transfer programmes are a poverty alleviation tool. Xinjiang has higher rates of poverty than other parts of China. A 2020 government white paper said that between 2017 and 2019, surplus labour programmes in Kashgar and the nearby Hotan prefecture helped 135,000 people find jobs. Between 2014 and 2019, an average of 1.68 million people a year were relocated through surplus labour programmes in southern Xinjiang, according to the white paper. A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in London said the “so-called ‘forced labour’ in Xinjiang is a lie propagated by anti-China forces. It is the complete opposite of the fact that the labour rights and interests of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are effectively protected. “Chinese governments at all levels fully respect the will of the people of all ethnic groups with regard to employment and provide necessary vocational training for those who sign up for relevant jobs. The smiles on the face of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang who got rid of poverty after finding jobs are the best and most effective rebuttal to the relevant lies and rumours. The spokesperson added that Adrian Zenz “makes a living by fabricating rumours on Xinjiang and slandering China and has no credit or academic integrity whatsoever”. They pointed out that Zenz is currently being sued by some Xinjiang enterprises and residents, and strongly rejected his analysis. ‘Forced labour has existed in Xinjiang for a really long time’ According to experts, labour transfer programmes often involve coerced labour, especially since 2017 and the threat of detention in a re-education camp for failing to comply with government programmes. Chinese government documents state that refusal to cooperate with poverty alleviation programmes, such as labour transfer programmes, is a potential sign of extremism. This puts a person at risk of being detained in a re-education facility. Experts say that it is impossible to know whether these schemes are participated in voluntarily and that there is a high risk of coercion. It is very difficult for international stakeholders to conduct independent due diligence on this process. The US government takes the position that goods from Xinjiang are made with forced labour unless it can be proven otherwise. Nyrola Elimä, an independent researcher, said it was highly possible the cotton was “tainted by forced labour”. “It’s very difficult for a Uyghur to say no. And since 2017, it’s become impossible to say no, because the alternative is you go to the reeducation camp.” There are also concerns about the environmental integrity of the carbon credits linked to this project, as it is unclear whether the plant relied on carbon revenue for its construction. For a carbon credit to have worth, it must represent a benefit to the climate that would not have happened anyway. The term used to describe this is called “additionality”. Danny Cullenward, a senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, said: “The methodology used to issue credits to this project does not assess project additionality, which is assumed rather than analysed. That omission might have made sense in the 1990s, but it isn’t credible today to assume that these kinds of projects are commercially infeasible without income from carbon credits,” he said. The findings come amid growing scrutiny of South Pole’s role as a carbon project developer. Recent news reports have raised concerns about one particular scheme in Zimbabwe called Kariba, which has reportedly generated about $100m (£80m) in revenue but had financial due diligence issues. In a statement, the company said it was “determined to learn from the experience of working with the Kariba REDD+ project in Zimbabwe. At the core of this commitment is a focus on enhancing … group-wide quality and risk controls, and due diligence processes.” Heuberger said it had been his life’s privilege “to have helped build this stellar team united by a drive to deliver scalable positive climate impact”.

2023-03-25T00:15:40Z,"First global water conference in 50 years yields hundreds of pledges, zero checks",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/24/united-nations-water-conference-new-york-pledges,"The first global water conference in almost half a century has concluded with the creation of a new UN envoy for water and hundreds of non-binding pledges that if fulfilled would edge the world towards universal access to clean water and sanitation. The three-day summit in New York spurred almost 700 commitments from local and national governments, non-profits and some businesses to a new Water Action Agenda, and progress on the hotchpotch of voluntary pledges will be monitored at future UN gatherings. A new scientific panel on water will also be created by the UN. Overall, organizers said they were happy that governments and representatives from academia, industries, and non-profits had come together to discuss the often neglected topic of water and to commit billions of dollars to improving water security. But they conceded that more was needed than a set of voluntary commitments such as a formal global agreement, like the 2015 Paris climate accords and the 2022 Montreal biodiversity pact, as well as better data and an international finance mechanism to safeguard water supplies. “This conference did not give us a mandate for this, but we brought the world together to ensure there is a follow-up,” said Henk Ovink, special envoy for water for the Netherlands, which co-hosted the conference along with Tajikistan. “We have fragmented water governance across the world, fragmented finance and not enough science and data in place.” “We know our job is still not done and in fact we are falling behind in our task,” said Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Singapore’s senior minister and co-chair of a summit interactive dialogue. “But we know the job can be done. We must now treat water as a global common good to be protected collectively, in the interests of all nations.” In closing the historic summit, António Guterres, the secretary general of the UN, urged everyone to turn the pledges into action. “All of humanity’s hopes for the future depend, in some way, on charting a new course to sustainably manage and conserve water … it needs to be at the centre of the political agenda.” Talks ended with a broad agreement that water should be treated as a global common good, and that the world’s approach to water must be less siloed given its nexus with the climate crisis, and food, energy and national security. But with no internationally binding agreement, experts fear that pledges could slide as it will be hard to hold governments, industry and financial institutions to account. On Friday morning, more than 100 water experts from research institutions and civil society groups across five continents sent a letter to the UN general secretary slamming the lack of “accountability, rigour and ambition” at the conference, arguing that the paucity of scientific rigour and binding agreements will fail to secure the more just, resilient and sustainable water future urgently needed. “Trying to solve one of the greatest challenges facing humanity with voluntary commitments and solutions based on half-baked evidence is like taking a knife to a gunfight – it simply isn’t good enough, and represents a betrayal of the world’s poor who bear the brunt of the water crisis,” said Nick Hepworth, executive director of Water Witness. Charles Iceland, global director for water at the World Resources Institute, said only about a third of these announcements were “gamechangers” that would substantially improve the water crisis. “I think the voluntary commitments are a good start … Each voluntary commitment has a place where you talk about how much money is available, most of them left that blank.” “We need a Paris agreement for water globally, and national water plans for each country, and regional water plans for each shared basin and aquifer,” Iceland added. About 90% of climate impacts are related to water – too much, too little, or too dirty – yet only 3% of climate finance is currently dedicated to the world’s water systems. Water related conflicts have risen sharply in recent years as sources dwindle, including many internal disputes between urban and rural dwellers, and pastoralists and farmers, according to research by the Pacific Institute. Almost 7,000 people attended the conference, but the private sector and global north were far better represented than experts and water insecure communities at the frontline of the water crisis from the global south – many of whom were excluded due to visa and financial barriers. Only a dozen or so world leaders attended the conference, and there were no protests and few activists to call out government and business hypocrisies. Mana Omar, 28, one of few activists from Fridays for Future Africa to get a visa, said: “As a young person without affiliation to a big organisation there was no opportunity to share experiences of my community,” said Omar, who is from Kenya’s arid Kajiado county where girls and women from pastoral Indigenous communities are facing worsening gender-based violence as drought forces them to travel further to find water. “The water action agenda should include diverse experiences, but too many communities are missing, and there’s nothing legally binding so how can we hold the countries to account?” added Omar. A UN spokesperson said they were unaware of any access issues. The conference also failed to address the violence and threats faced by communities trying to protect dwindling water sources from mining, industrial agriculture and other polluting industries. “It is a very bureaucratic event where only large NGOs, governments and private companies could express themselves,” said Juan Gabriel Martinez, 34, a land and water defender from Manizales, Colombia, where the community is under attack by armed militias. A quarter of the world’s population still does not have access to safe drinking water while half lacks basic sanitation – which is one of the sustainable development goals for 2030. Progress has been slow due to the lack of financial investment from rich countries – which has moved towards loans not grants, insufficient political will and a siloed approach to water. At the current rate, universal access to clean water and sanitation will not be achieved for decades after the 2030 target. Samuel Godfrey, the UN Development Programme’s principal water resources advisor, said: “What’s come out of this is the need to move toward regional goals after 2030.” And while the summit may have nudged the world in the right direction, as Musonda Mumba, secretary general for the convention on wetlands, said in her closing statement: “The crisis is everywhere … we have no time.”",United Nations; Water; Climate crisis; US news; New York,World news
2023-02-19T12:10:21Z,It’s high time to rethink how the World Bank operates,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/19/its-high-time-to-rethink-how-the-world-bank-operates,"Wanted: a new president for the World Bank, a venerable global institution with a mission to eradicate poverty. The successful candidate will have a plan for tackling the crisis in human development caused by the global pandemic. Climate-change deniers and non-Americans need not apply. By all accounts, the US has already made up its mind who it wants to run one of the two bodies established at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944. Rajiv Shah, who runs the Rockefeller Foundation and was formerly the head of the US agency for international development (USAID) is the hot favourite to take over from the departing David Malpass. The idea that the White House should have the right to appoint the president of such an important organisation is a scandalous anachronism. But that has how it has been since the Bank and its sister organisation, the International Monetary Fund, were created as the second world war was drawing to a close. A deal was done in which the Europeans got to pick the managing director of the IMF, while the Americans got the Bank. Much has happened in the intervening eight decades, not least the growing share of the world economy accounted for by emerging and developing countries. Unsurprisingly, the stranglehold advanced countries continue to exert over the IMF and the World Bank rankles in Beijing, New Delhi, Brasília and elsewhere, too. There’s been talk since Malpass announced his departure of a campaign to persuade Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, to be the candidate for the developing world. No question, Mottley would give the World Bank the direction it has lacked in recent years. She was responsible for the Bridgetown Initiative – a plan for the reform of development finance that would involve automatic debt relief for countries faced by pandemics or natural disasters; an extra $1tn of funding from development banks (including the World Bank) for climate resilience; and a new mechanism for channelling private sector investment into climate mitigation. Certainly, the Bank needs to start punching its weight in a way it hasn’t under Malpass. Sustainable development goals set by the United Nations for 2030 will not be hit on current trends, yet the World Bank has been overly cautious in its lending approach. A report prepared for the G20 group of developed and developing countries found that with a less conservative approach, multilateral development banks could increase their lending by hundreds of billions of dollars. Malpass jumped before he was pushed. Being handpicked by Donald Trump for the job was one reason Joe Biden would have denied him a second term. The other was that he was seen as insufficiently exercised by the threat posed by the climate crisis, if not an outright climate-change denier. His departure, Biden believes, will enable the Bank to focus on the provision of climate finance to poor countries. It might be assumed that developing countries would be pleased by such a prospect. In fact, they are alarmed by it for two reasons. The first is concern the Bank will be diverted from its core development agenda. The emerging world certainly wants more cash for climate mitigation and adaptation but not if it is at the expense of finance for energy, transport, schools and hospitals. The second reason developing countries feel uneasy about the World Bank morphing into a World Climate Bank is that its record has been less than stellar. Developing countries rightly ask the following question: why would the World Bank be any better at financing our green transition than it has been at lifting us out of poverty? It is a good question. Climate change is an issue of growing importance for the World Bank, but it also has work to do in helping developing countries strengthen their economies, build resilience against future pandemics, reduce inequality and ease debt burdens. If the focus on climate crisis starts to crowd out other issues, the result will be a further fragmentation of the multilateral system, with poor countries increasingly tempted to borrow from China’s rival to the World Bank – the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank. Malpass was not the disaster some of his detractors imagined when he was appointed by Trump, although that’s largely because he didn’t do very much. Neither, to be frank, has any president since James Wolfensohn (1995-2005) left much of a mark either. It is now time to rethink both the way the Bank operates and whether the multilateral institutions are fit for purpose. The immediate task is to appoint the right person to run the Bank, that means someone with a development plan. Realistically, the White House will get the candidate it wants, but Biden needs to choose carefully. The pandemic has put the anti-poverty agenda back by years. Inequality and debt have become ever-more serious threats, and the person running the World Bank needs to have an answer to them. More fundamentally, an overhaul of the Bretton Woods system is long overdue. The World Bank is being given extra responsibility for climate finance not because it is the ideal choice for the task but because there is no perceived alternative. In an ideal world, there would be a new multilateral bank dedicated to climate finance and energy transition, with an international debt authority that would replace the current inadequate framework for dealing with sovereign indebtedness. Developed countries are strongly opposed to setting up new multilateral institutions, but they need to recognise there is little future in trying to tackle problems of the 2020s with institutions created in the 1940s. Winning the battle against climate change also means winning the battle against global poverty. To do that requires new organisations, new approaches and a new urgency.",World Bank; International Monetary Fund (IMF); Mia Mottley; Climate finance; Climate crisis; Business; Economics; Global development; Environment; World news; Environmental sustainability; Emerging markets; Debt relief; Joe Biden,Business
2022-12-09T01:05:44Z,‘I’m ready for the future’: how an MBA course has set these students on paths to success,https://www.theguardian.com/griffith-mba-lead-a-better-world/2022/dec/09/im-ready-for-the-future-how-an-mba-course-has-set-these-students-on-paths-to-success,"We meet two students – an ambitious leader and a lifelong learner – to find out how their time studying a Master of Business Administration (MBA) has shaped what comes next. ‘I’ve become a better version of myself’ Maria del Mundo is passionate about seeing women in leadership roles. She enrolled in an MBA course at Griffith University with a plan to enhance her professional skill set and capabilities, and now, in her final year, she feels empowered to make positive change. “For many professionals, like myself, the MBA seems like the next logical step to advancing my career,” she says. “The MBA can give you insights and hone your skills to solve complex business problems; that really encouraged me to further my studies.” After initially earning a bachelor’s degree in nursing and business management, del Mundo sought new professional experiences in the health and corporate sectors. Time spent volunteering in Asia reinforced in her the value of education, and set her on a path to higher learning. Credit: Manuella Vasconcelos “Unlike many traditional MBAs, Griffith positively reimagined how to teach business, the role of business in society and what the creation of value for business means,” she says. “The value-based MBA program has a great focus on responsible leadership and sustainable practices that are tied to the United Nations sustainable development goals. This ingrained in me that business needs to step up and recognise they can, and must, be a force for good. And, as individuals, we can be a catalyst for change.” Working for a nonprofit in the health sector, del Mundo says she has been able to take what she’s learning and apply it in a real-world environment. Through Covid, she was able to use technology to help her organisation adapt and thrive, and better support members of the local community. Now, del Mundo is looking to the future and deciding which opportunity to grab. With offers from multiple businesses in Australia and overseas, she has a sense that this is only the beginning of a rewarding career. “I see this phase as character building, with its intense and reflective experience that allowed me to look at the parts of my life that need changing and take the next leap,” she says. “It made me realise how much opportunity is really out there in the world – you just have to take the first step.” Credit: Manuella Vasconcelos *** ‘It taught me a better way of learning and understanding’ Vince Sherry is a Griffith MBA graduate who finished his degree in 2020. As a recent retiree to Tenterfield, New South Wales, he was looking for an enriching learning experience that would also challenge him. “I was living in a small, rural town, involved with the local Chamber of Commerce and some business opportunities there,” he says. “I really wanted to pursue this in a deeper way. I chose Griffith primarily because I liked the way their degree was heading: impact for innovation, problem solving, creativity, sustainability.” Sherry’s studies quickly became relevant to his life in the local community. When dealing with the council on waste management, he drew on what he had been studying around sustainability and landfill. On another occasion, he focused his learning on leadership and community engagement to solve problems within a local music festival’s committee. “As I started progressing through the courses, and living where I was living, I started to focus all the studies and assignments I was doing on practical solutions for things that were going on in Tenterfield,” he says. Seeing his new knowledge in action sparked Sherry’s desire to keep learning. Now, he hopes to embark on a PhD, in which he will explore the experience of moving from a large urban area to a rural location through a new lens. As a mature-age student, he recommends the MBA experience for anyone wanting to broaden their knowledge, even if they don’t plan to put it into practice. “The MBA taught me about digging deeper and asking questions, and accepting ambiguity, broadening the lens,” he says. “It taught me discipline to think and engage and be a little more patient. It taught me a better way of learning and understanding.” Find out how Griffith’s MBA program could change your future.",,Griffith MBA: Lead a better world
2021-07-01T09:14:15Z,Australia ranks last for climate action among UN member countries,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/01/australia-ranks-last-for-climate-action-among-un-member-countries,"Australia has been ranked last for climate action out of nearly 200 countries in a report assessing progress towards global sustainable development goals. The Sustainable Development Report 2021, first reported by Renew Economy, scored Australia last out of 193 United Nations member countries for action taken to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. A database shows Australia received a score of just 10 out of 100 in an assessment of fossil fuel emissions, emissions associated with imports and exports, and policies for pricing carbon. Second last was Brunei, which was ranked behind Qatar and Norway. Richie Merzian, a climate expert at the Australia Institute, said the result was unsurprising. “Australia has received similar rankings from other comparable studies, including the Climate Change Performance Index, which last year ranked Australia second last behind only Trump’s America,” he said. “The federal government has no climate and energy policy and instead has cherry-picked technologies, many of which support the fossil fuel industry.” The report noted Australia had not committed to achieving netzero carbon emissions by 2050. Scott Morrison has instead signalled Australia wants to achieve carbon neutrality as soon as possible and “preferably” by 2050. The most recent emissions data, released by the government in late May, showed Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions were at the lowest levels in 30 years as the coronavirus pandemic put a handbrake on fossil fuel burning in the transport sector and slowed economic activity. In a statement at the time, the energy minister, Angus Taylor, said those levels were despite “upward pressure from growth in exports and industry”. The Sustainable Development Report tracks countries’ progress towards the UN’s 17 sustainable development goals, which include quality education, gender equality, wiping out poverty, creating sustainable cities and communities, and affordable and clean energy. Australia ranked 35th overall, performing strongly on health and wellbeing, economic growth, education and clean water and sanitation. For clean energy, Australia was listed as having “major challenges” but recorded a moderate improvement over the past 12 months. The report says countries should not allow the Covid-19 pandemic to lead to a prolonged reversal in progress towards the goals. “International commitments, for instance towards climate neutrality, must be rapidly accompanied by transformative actions and investments,” the report says. “Large fiscal packages of major economies present an opportunity to foster a green, digital, and inclusive recovery.”",Climate crisis; Australia news; Environment; Sustainable development; World news; United Nations; Sustainable development goals; Global development,Environment
2023-03-10T07:00:44Z,I once admired Russell Brand. But his grim trajectory shows us where politics is heading | George Monbiot,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/10/russell-brand-politics-public-figures-responsibility,"In 2014, the Guardian asked me to nominate my hero of the year. To some people’s surprise, I chose Russell Brand. I loved the way he energised young people who had been alienated from politics. I claimed, perhaps hyperbolically, he was “the best thing that has happened to the left in years” (in my defence, there wasn’t, at the time, much competition). Today, I can scarcely believe it’s the same man. I’ve watched 50 of his recent videos, with growing incredulity. He appears to have switched from challenging injustice to conjuring phantoms. If, as I suspect it might, politics takes a very dark turn in the next few years, it will be partly as a result of people like Brand. It’s hard to decide which is most dispiriting: the stupidity of some of the theories he recites, or the lack of originality. He repeatedly says he’s not a conspiracy theorist, but, to me, he certainly sounds like one. In 2014, he was bursting with new ideas and creative ways of presenting them. Today, he wastes his talent on tired and discredited tales: endless iterations of the alleged evils of the World Economic Forum founder, Klaus Schwab, the Great Reset, Bill Gates, Nancy Pelosi, the former US chief medical adviser, Anthony Fauci, Covid vaccines, medical data, the World Health Organization, Pfizer, smart cities and “the globalist masterplan”. His videos appear to promote “natural immunity” ahead of vaccines, and for a while pushed ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine as treatments for Covid (they aren’t). He championed the “Freedom Convoy” that occupied Ottawa, which apparently stood proudly against the “tyranny” of Justin Trudeau’s policies. He hawks Graham Hancock’s widely debunked claims about ancient monuments. A wildly popular clip from one of his videos about the Dutch nitrate crisis offers a classic conspiracy theory mashup: a tangle of claims that may be true in other contexts, random accusations, scapegoating and resonances with some old and very ugly tropes. He claims that “this whole fertiliser situation is a scam”. The real objective is “to bankrupt the farmers so their land can be grabbed”. This “shows you how the Great Reset operates”, using “globalist” regulations to throw farmers off their land. He claims it’s “connected to the land grab of Bill Gates” and the “corruption of companies like Monsanto”. In reality, the Dutch government was forced to act by a legal ruling, as levels of nitrate pollution, largely from livestock farms, break European law. Its attempts to curb this pollution have nothing to do with the World Economic Forum and its vacuous rhetoric about a “Great Reset”. Or with Bill Gates. Or with Monsanto, which hasn’t existed since 2018 when it was bought by Bayer. So why mention them? Perhaps because these terms have become potent click triggers. Brand is repeating claims first made by far-right conspiracists, who have piled into this issue, claiming that the nitrate crisis is a pretext to seize land from farmers, in whom, they claim, true Dutch identity is vested, and hand it to asylum seekers and other immigrants. It’s a version of the “great replacement” conspiracy theory, itself a reworking of the Nazis’ blood and soil tropes about protecting the “rooted” and “authentic” people – in whom “racial purity” and “true” German identity was vested – from “cosmopolitan” and “alien” forces (ie Jews). Brand may not realise this, as the language has changed a little – “cosmopolitans” have become “globalists”, “aliens” have become “immigrants” – but the themes have not. On and drearily on he goes. He manages to confuse the World Health Organization’s call for better pandemic surveillance (by which it means the tracking of infectious diseases) with coercive surveillance of the population, creating “centralised systems of control where you are ultimately a serf”. Some of his many rants about Bill Gates are illustrated with an image of the man wearing a multicoloured lapel badge, helpfully circled in red. This speaks to another widespread conspiracy theory: those who wear this badge are members of a secret organisation conspiring to control the world (so secret they stick it on their jackets). In reality, it shows support for the UN sustainable development goals. Such claims are not just wrong. They are wearyingly, boringly wrong. But, to judge by the figures (he has more than 6 million subscribers on YouTube), the audience loves them. Some of his theories, such as his recent obsession with UFOs, are innocuous enough. Others have potential to do great harm. There’s the risk to the people scapegoated, such as Fauci, Schwab and Pelosi: subjects of conspiracy theories often become targets of violence. There are the risks misleading claims present to public health. And bizarre stories about shadowy “elites” protect real elites from scrutiny and challenge. While I’m not suggesting this is his purpose, it’s a tactic used deliberately by powerful people to disarm those who might otherwise hold them to account. Donald Trump’s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, had a term for it: “flood the zone with shit”. As Naomi Klein has shown, the Great Reset conspiracy theory was conceived by a staffer at the Heartland Institute, a US lobby group that has promoted climate denial and other billionaire-friendly positions. It’s a bastardisation of her shock doctrine hypothesis, distracting people from the malfeasance of those with real power. Worse still, conspiracism is fascism’s fuel. Almost all successful conspiracy theories originate with or land with the far right. I’m not suggesting for one minute that Brand is sympathetic to fascism, but his videos are likely to assist its spread. As for his own politics, while he claims to have transcended left and right, I see a clear rightward shift. He concentrates his fire on centrists – Biden, Pelosi, Hillary Clinton, Trudeau – while appearing to support Trump. He extols Trump’s “virility”, which he contrasts with “Biden’s senility”. So what’s going on? Brand has yet to reply to questions I emailed him last week, so I can only guess. I have seen other people drift into absurdity by telling their followers what they want to hear, and I wonder whether it’s happening here. At one point, he tells his audience: “We are amplifying the voice that you give us. We are feeding back to you the truth that you have long understood.” Of Ron DeSantis, the extreme rightwing Florida governor, he says to his viewers: “I know a lot of you guys like him”, which might explain his weirdly equivocal reporting of DeSantis’s vicious state censorship, which is everything he claims to oppose. Until recently, I thought younger people, demanding a fairer, kinder world, would transform our politics. Now I’m not so sure. I believe Brand and others are helping to confuse and distract them in their millions, shutting down meaningful engagement. He has, in this respect, become the opposite of what he was.

2022-10-26T10:00:07Z,Universities in US and Canada beat UK in sustainability league,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/oct/26/universities-us-canada-uk-sustainability-league-edinburgh-rank-emissions-targets,"UK universities are below their US and Canadian counterparts in a sustainability global league table that ranks them on their environmental footprint and contribution to society, as student climate campaigners warn that nearly half are falling behind their emissions targets. The rankings place the University of California, Berkeley, at No 1, followed by two Canadian institutions, the University of Toronto and the University of British Columbia, with Edinburgh University the top-performing UK institution in fourth place as a result of its strong sustainability research. The second-highest UK university was Glasgow, in 13th place, which the rankings compiler QS said performed well in equality, thanks to having a large number of female leaders and taking a transparent approach to governance. Next is Oxford, in 16th place, Newcastle at 18th, and Cambridge, which claimed 19th spot. Andrew MacFarlane, the QS ranking manager, said the UK had performed “exceptionally well”, with the second-highest proportion of institutions in the top 100 after the US. “On average, [UK universities] demonstrate good ratios of gender diversity, both at the staff and student level, published commitments to diversity and tolerance as well as climate mitigation and governance, an impressive research focus that speaks to many of the UN’s SDGs and evidence of transparent governance,” he said. However, Quinn Runkle, the director of education at Students Organising for Sustainability, warned that nearly half of UK universities were not on track to meet carbon emissions targets and two-fifths had yet to commit to divesting from fossil fuels. “While it is positive to see UK universities performing well in the overall ranking, I think this is a reflection of how far the sector still has to go. Coming at the top does not necessarily mean institutions are doing all that must be done, rather that they are just doing more than others,” she said. She added that sustainability rankings could be a helpful tool in driving change and she hoped such measures would be included in overall league tables. “Worldwide just 3% of people attend university but graduates make up 80% of leadership positions so universities have an enormous duty to ensure decision-makers get it right when it comes to sustainability,” Runkle said. Fiona Goodwin, the chief executive of the Alliance for Sustainability Leadership in Education, said “sustainability is an increasing factor of choice for where students apply”, adding that she hoped the Department for Education’s new sustainability and climate strategy would provide the leadership and drive for universities to do more. QS’s survey of 3,000 students found that 82% of applicants researched their prospective institution’s sustainability work, while 87% considered its track record on equality and diversity. Nearly three-quarters (73%) of students from western Europe cited the climate emergency as the biggest issue for young people. The rankings are based on two categories: environmental impact, including institutional sustainability and teaching and research on the climate crisis, and social impact, which measures the institution’s equality and diversity, and how social justice features in curriculums and research. Edinburgh’s high ranking was a result of it producing research aligned with the UN’s sustainable development goals, a good record on diversity, a strong environmental sciences department – including a climate institute and courses such as Msc climate change – and lots of partnerships with universities from the global south. Planned initiatives include a carbon sequestration programme, which will sequester more than 1m tonnes of CO2, total divestment from fossil fuels, scholarships for people from the areas most affected by the climate crisis to investigate ways to combat its effects and work supporting the Scottish capital’s net zero target. Dave Gorman, the director of social responsibility and sustainability at Edinburgh University, said the institution aimed to “raise our ambition year on year”, adding that it hoped to further develop on this over the next decade by widening its sustainability focus to include social responsibility, biodiversity, resources and the circular economy.",Sustainability; Universities; Education; Higher education; Environment; Climate crisis; Greenhouse gas emissions; US universities; Canada; California; US news,Education
2023-03-22T20:38:05Z,UN warns of ‘draining humanity’s lifeblood’ amid worsening water scarcity,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/22/un-water-conference-warns-worsening-scarcity,"The United Nations opened its first water conference in almost half a century in New York on Wednesday, with a plea for countries to work together to tackle overconsumption, water guzzling industries and the climate crisis – or else face more hunger, conflicts and forced migration due to worsening water scarcity. A quarter of the world’s population still does not have access to safe drinking water while half lacks basic sanitation, and despite some progress in recent years, the climate crisis is making the situation worse. “We are draining humanity’s lifeblood through vampiric overconsumption and unsustainable use, and evaporating it through global heating,” said UN secretary general António Guterres. “Governments must develop and implement plans that ensure equitable water access for all people while conserving this precious resource.” Universal access to clean drinking water and sanitation is one of 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) created through the UN process in 2015, alongside ending hunger and poverty, achieving gender equality, and taking action on climate change. At the current pace of investment and political will, access to water and sanitation (SDG6) will not be achieved for decades after the 2030 target. At this rate, only 37% of people in sub-Saharan Africa will have safely managed water by 2030. Access within the richest countries is also uneven, with Native American households 19 times more likely to live without basic plumbing than white Americans. According to an analysis by WaterAid, investment needs to more than triple to at least $200bn a year to close the current financial gap and get everyone on the planet access to safe water and sanitation by 2030. The Covid pandemic and the climate breakdown – which has exacerbated water scarcity (drought) in many countries and damaged critical infrastructure damage (extreme storms and flooding) – have underscored that access to water and sanitation are deeply connected to health, economic activity, food insecurity and education. Girls and women cannot go to school or engage in paid employment if they need to spend hours collecting water every day. Neither malnutrition in children nor obesity in adults can be tackled without access to safe, clean and affordable water. Yet so far, governments and other agencies have done a poor job at connecting the dots, said Michael Dunford, director of the World Food Programme’s east Africa region where 82 million are facing acute hunger and famine due to drought – up from 60 million this time last year. “Eradicating hunger is unattainable without water security.” “We have to break down silos if we’re going to solve this problem. This conference needs to be a galvanising moment globally and across sectors, and kickstart work towards something binding,” said Elizabeth Marcey, WaterAid’s US director of policy and advocacy. “For too long Wash [water, sanitation and hygiene] efforts have been focused on plumbing not people. The access gap has significantly closed but solutions need to be locally sustainable and culturally appropriate.” The conference is taking place at a time of unprecedented water related crises: global heating is causing increasingly intense drought and floods; industrial agriculture, mining, fossil fuels, cement and other industries are using and polluting increasingly scarce water resources; and 10% of the rise in global forced migration is linked to water shortages. Drought in the American west and Europe has demonstrated how the climate crisis is threatening access to water in countries and communities that had until recently taken water for granted. Despite what’s at stake, the conference lacks the drama of the annual climate talks. Only a handful of world leaders are expected, and so far there have been few concrete financial pledges. Instead, the conference is expected to culminate in the Water Action Agenda – a non-binding collection of commitments from the public, nonprofit and private sectors that the UN hopes will scale-up actions needed for global water security. In a statement, the White House said the US would “unveil a series of commitments of up to $49bn” towards the Water Action Agenda, but there were few details apart from $700m (from a previously announced aid package) to help 22 priority countries. On the question of financing, delegates from climate vulnerable nations outlined the loss and damage to livelihoods, land, cultures and life already being suffered due to rising sea level, groundwater salination, drought, storm surges and irregular rainfall patterns, as part of a side event on the nexus between water and forced migration. In Bangladesh, the government is building new townships to move coastal communities. The Tuvalu official said that some areas are already uninhabitable forcing residents to relocate. “We don’t want to move out of or country, so we need the support of the international community on loss and damage.” Cop27 in Egypt last year ended with a groundbreaking agreement to create a fund through which rich polluting countries mostly responsible for global heating will partially compensate poor vulnerable countries for irreversible loss and damage from the climate crisis. The three-day water conference includes almost a hundred side events with at least 8,000 delegates expected to attend in person. But access to the UN conference – like access to safe, clean affordable water (and the climate talks) – is unequal. Water justice advocates warned about the corporate capture of the UN water agenda with Bayer, Unilever, Cargill and Coca Cola among the polluting multinationals holding events. Meanwhile representatives from frontline communities have been denied access due to visa, accreditation and funding issues. “You can’t plan or make decisions for people without their presence, we represent our communities so without us, our voices are lost, our people and communities are not heard,” said Nigerian youth activist Lovelyn Andrawus from Rise Up Nigeria and Fridays For Future who could not get a visa. “Water or climate issues are global crises with local solutions so we need to be represented.” The tension between private sector priorities and public access bubbled over at an event on water as the lynchpin for global resilience organised by the US delegation. Detlef Stammer from the World Meteorological Organisation blasted the speaker from Diageo, the global drinks company that sells Johnny Walker whiskey and Guinness, after she made the business case for investing in Wash and water conservation. Forty of Diageo’s 200 global sites are operating in water stressed places. “You pump so much groundwater out of the ground to put things into plastic bottles, there is not enough for agriculture,” said Stammer. “We have to distribute what we have in a way that’s most useful. That’s the whole story.” The privatisation of water and sanitation services is taking place across the world, and is being pushed by many governments and development banks. Osward Chanda, director for water development and sanitation at the African Development Bank, said: “The private sector is not a wholesale solution, or a panacea to all our problems but they do have resources and expertise that can make a difference.” But at a simultaneous event organised by the People’s Water Forum, Meera Karunananthan, from the Blue Planet Project in Canada, said the emphasis on getting the private sector involved in the delivery of clean water and sanitation was “alarming” and ignored years of research about the harmful consequences of privatisation from around the world. On Tuesday, Pedro Arrojo, the UN special rapporteur on the human right to water, helped launch the water justice manifesto which argues that access to water and sanitation is a fundamental human right, and that personal and domestic needs must take priority over industrial use and profits.",United Nations; World news; Water; Environment,World news
2022-09-20T05:00:02Z,"EU wastes 153m tonnes of food a year – much more than it imports, says report",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/20/eu-wastes-153m-tonnes-of-food-a-year-much-more-than-it-imports-says-report,"The EU wastes more food than it imports and could puncture food price inflation by simply curbing on-farm waste, according to a report. About 153m tonnes of food in the EU are frittered away every year, double previous estimates and 15m tonnes more than is shipped in, according to the study’s estimates. The amount of wheat wasted in the EU alone is equal to roughly half of Ukraine’s wheat exports, and a quarter of the EU’s other grain exports, it says. Frank Mechielsen, the director of Feedback EU, which produced the study, said: “At a time of high food prices and a cost of living crisis, it’s a scandal that the EU is potentially throwing away more food than it’s importing. The EU now has a massive opportunity to set legally binding targets to halve its food waste from farm to fork by 2030 to tackle climate change and improve food security.” Global food prices last month were 8% higher than a year ago, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), partly driven by the war in Ukraine. Wheat, maize and soya bean prices have this year even overshot records set at the height of the 2008 world financial crisis. Abdolreza Abbassian, a grain market analyst and former senior FAO economist, said the era of cheap food was over and prices would probably remain high, even after the Russia-Ukraine war has ended. “Because of the energy situation, the fertiliser situation, uncertainties in the world, including in transport and shipments, not to mention climate change we have to accept that we are not going to see food prices at the levels of a decade ago, that we had become used to,” he said. Olivier De Schutter, a co-chair of the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems, and a UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said the problem was that the agrifood industry had historically found waste more advantageous than efficiency. “At both ends of the food chain it’s expensive to reduce waste and it is profitable to sell people more food than they need,” he said. “Sell-by dates are also set in a way that obliges people to buy more than they can actually consume.” Brussels is expected to bring forward a proposal later this year for the world’s first legally enforceable goals to curb food waste – 43 green non-profits have backed Feedback EU’s call for a 50% drop in waste by 2030. Piotr Barczak, the senior policy officer for the European Environmental Bureau (EEB), said: “All EU countries had committed to halve food waste within the United Nations’ sustainable development goals. However, almost 10 years later, they have not achieved much, and our economies still generate incredibly high amounts of food waste.” The EEB wants to see legal measures for cutting waste along the whole food supply chain, including production, processing and food services. No official EU baseline data for on-farm food waste in 2020 has yet been published but the new study used calculations from the UN Environment Programme’s food waste index and a WWF meta-study, both from 2021. The report sources about 90m tonnes of food waste to primary production – three times more than household waste. Most of this is probably unrecorded, as EU waste measurements tend to exclude food left unharvested, unused or unsold on farms. An estimated 20% of EU food production is wasted each year, at a cost to EU businesses and households of €143bn (£125bn) a year. Food waste is responsible for at least 6% of the bloc’s total greenhouse gas emissions. A separate study published on Monday in Nature Food found that wheat and maize trading would only partly alleviate global food shortages caused by the war in Ukraine, and even then, at the cost of spurring carbon emissions. The paper projects a probable increase in maize and wheat prices of 4.6% and 7.2% respectively over the coming year.",Food waste; European Union; Europe; World news; Environment,Environment
2023-02-11T11:00:03Z,A sustainable fashion week. Too good to be true?,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/feb/11/a-sustainable-fashion-week-too-good-to-be-true,"What do you do if you’re a designer who is trying to be more sustainable but you want to show at fashion week? For Emilie Helmstedt, a Danish designer who took part in last week’s Copenhagen fashion week, the solution for the footwear styled with her dresses came from her team who brought in their old Nike and Adidas trainers. Covering them with ribbons, beads and paint, Helmstedt decided it was better than using new versions, as she has done in the past. It also chimed with the rest of the collection – her finale look which was made from scraps of material accumulated in her studio. Copenhagen fashion week started in 2006 with relatively low-level fanfare. Then, three years ago, Danish organisers set out a series of sustainability requirements for designers to meet in order to be allowed to show in 2023 which would set them apart from the main fashion weeks – New York, Milan, Paris and London – on the global calendar Based on the United Nations sustainable development goals, the organisers decided on 18 requirements that would apply to the event itself, as well as to all designers who wanted to participate. “I had a clear idea of what I wanted to do differently. It was about time to set specific requirements rather than just give guidelines,” says Cecilie Thorsmark, the chief executive officer of Copenhagen fashion week (CPHFW) who outlined these requirements, which include a rule that 50% of a collection must be made using textiles from new generation materials such as alternatives to animal-derived raw materials like leather. Deadstock, recycled or upcycled materials are also encouraged. Most brands have dropped fur from collections but, here, fur is banned outright and any unsold stock from previous collections cannot be destroyed – the most prevalent technique, burning and slashing items, was employed by brands including Burberry in the past. Instead, brands are to sell to discount outlets such as TK Maxx or enter them into the circular economy. Brands must also ensure, by exercising due diligence and working with suppliers, that chains are free from child labour and factories provide safe and fair working conditions. Thorsmark, who previously worked for the Global Fashion Agenda, an industry group focused on sustainability, says she took the job in 2018 to challenge both the role and purpose of fashion week. Implementing the requirements was a risk. CPHFW didn’t want to lose the bigger commercial names such as Ganni that attract international press and buyers. Thirty brands were approached with 28 qualifying three years later. Applications were first reviewed by a show committee made up of industry experts, then reviewed and verified by Ramboll, an external consultancy company. One brand dropped out of the process halfway through while another was rejected after failing to meet all 18 obligations (Thorsmark wouldn’t reveal which brand it was). On paper, it’s encouraging news from what is often considered the fifth fashion week. But despite the changes many remain sceptical. Ciara Barry, policy and campaigns manager at the non-profit Fashion Revolution, is currently mandating for living wage legislation across the fashion sector. She says it is concerning that the requirements don’t even mention fair pay. “There is an inherent hypocrisy with a glamorous fashion show displaying collections which are made in poverty. All players in the fashion industry should call for systemic change – and fashion weeks have a role to play in this.” Barry says the omission also highlights the challenges that independent brands face from larger fast-fashion brands. “The nature of fashion’s supply chains make it incredibly difficult for individual brands to ensure living wages on their own,” says Barry. “They all share factories and suppliers.” Then there are the double standards around offsetting carbon emissions. In order to meet the zero waste requirement, brands sent digital QR codes in place of embossed paper invitations. Single-use plastic was banned, show sets were minimal and all props had to be reused. Meanwhile, members of the press and fashion buyers flew in from around the world to look at even more new clothing that was being produced. On the ground, the designers themselves were mainly optimistic about the changes. Henrik Vibskov, who has been showing for more than two decades, felt the requirements finally acknowledged the steps he has been trying to implement since 2016. “Everything has a life after its first use,” he said as he described his basement filled with archive pieces. His latest set featuring paper tomato trees is next going to be exhibited in Berlin. For (di)vision’s co-founders, the siblings Simon and Nanna Wick “creating from what already is” has been their ethos since they founded their streetwear inspired brand in 2018. To them, working with almost exclusively deadstock and upcycling materials is “a no brainer.” They also source their fabrics from suppliers in Italy, often using “waste material” from giant retailers or design houses. Wick says he managed to trace the fabric used for a faux-fur vest back to a collection from Stella McCartney, while a shirt featuring red wine stains was made from an old table cloth. It seemed a trickier area to navigate for the more commercially successful Scandi brands such as Stine Goya, Ganni and Rotate. Known for their signature sparkly dresses and accessories, sequins which have devastating environmental consequences continued to appear multiple times. Rotate claims its versions are sustainable as they are recycled. Ganni say it uses 100% recycled polyester sequins on a 100% recycled polyester backing. A spokesperson for Stine Goya said that it uses some recycled polyester versions and its team are looking for more sustainable options. Charlotte Eskildsen, co-founder of the Danish label The Garment, thinks it’s about phrasing – and that the word sustainable itself is problematic. She prefers the word “responsible”. “Fashion is never going to be sustainable and we know that we are contributing to an industry that is polluting way more than it should,” adds (di)vision’s Wick. While Oslo and Helsinki fashion weeks have already implemented Copenhagen’s framework, with New York’s fashion week kicking off many were hopeful that the noise generated by CPHFW could spark wider change, or at least conversation. Caroline Rush, CEO of the British Fashion Council, says London fashion week won’t be following suit. “The event hosts a mixture of established and emerging brands and as result of this setting a one-size-fits-all sustainability standard is not feasible without alienating the smaller businesses.” Instead the BFC says it encourages brands to commit to voluntary initiatives such as joining the UN’s Climate Challenge. Fiona Gooch, a senior policy adviser at the fair trade organisation Transform Trade, says both an EU regulator and a fashion watchdog as proposed in UK parliament is a better option. “The actions of large brands cause poverty wages and unsafe conditions and undermine smaller fashion brands who regularly use the same suppliers.” Barry adds: “The Copenhagen fashion week requirements are absolutely better than nothing, but all fashion shows should move forward by introducing sustainability standards that advance further – they could really drive meaningful change in doing so.” Thorsmark says: “If we rewind three years ago, not a single brand met any of the 18 requirements. Now they do so we will push them again to continue improving.”",Fashion; Fashion industry; Fashion weeks; Sustainable fashion,Fashion
2022-12-03T19:00:04Z,Coalition MP’s ‘grassroots’ nuclear power survey linked to consulting firm,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/04/coalition-mps-grassroots-nuclear-power-survey-linked-to-consulting-firm,"A Coalition frontbencher conducting a “grassroots” survey about nuclear power is using a website registered by a business that helps an American small modular reactor company, records reveal. Ted O’Brien, the shadow minister for climate change and energy, issued a statement on Friday saying he was “launching a grassroots community engagement program” under the banner “Time to Talk Nuclear”. He urged Australians to “join the conversation” by completing a short survey on the website, with the first question being: “What do you think could be the benefits of nuclear energy in Australia?” Guardian Australia can reveal the web domain was registered by Helixos Pty Ltd, a Sydney-based consulting company whose projects include “supporting the commercialisation of new nuclear energy technology”. Helixos lists the US company NuScale Power as one of its clients. Helixos says on its own website that NuScale Power “is reinventing nuclear energy and Helixos is helping them bring it to market”. It adds: “Helixos also provides training for employees to become technology ambassadors and engage with stakeholders and the public.” A search of domain records for O’Brien’s website shows the contact name for the domain registration is Lenka Kollar, a nuclear engineer who co-founded Helixos in 2020. She previously held the role of director of strategy and external relations for NuScale Power. In that previous role, Kollar was “working to bring NuScale’s small modular reactor to market through business plan development and clean energy outreach”, according to a profile published in 2017. Kollar addressed a Global Uranium Conference in Adelaide last month on the topic “reaching net zero with nuclear energy”. In tweets summarising her speech, Kollar said: “The time is now for Australians to have a conversation on nuclear energy and potentially overturn the ban.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup It is understood O’Brien engaged Helixos – which also does design work – as a contractor to support the development of the website. As part of designing the website it also registered the domain name. A source close to the matter said O’Brien’s team had sought out Helixos, believing it was ideal for the job because of its familiarity with the topic of nuclear energy. But the source said O’Brien had come up with the idea of the survey and the questions, and paid for the work himself. In a written response, O’Brien said the purpose of the survey and the use of collected data had “all been openly and accurately communicated”. “I’m personally paying for the grassroots community campaign ‘Time to Talk Nuclear’ out of my own back pocket because I think it’s an important conversation to have with the Australian people,” O’Brien said. “As we assess the prospect for nuclear energy moving forward, I will continue to seek assistance from people who are experts in the field.” The vice-president of marketing and communications for NuScale Power, Diane Hughes, said: “Helixos does in fact provide services for NuScale Power. “However, outside of providing an example image of our small modular reactor technology, NuScale does not have any involvement in the website, survey, nor outreach on advanced nuclear technologies being conducted by Mr O’Brien.” Helixos and Kollar were also contacted for comment. Helixos describes itself as a business that works “at the intersection of strategy consulting and technical advisory, specialising in cleantech commercialisation” and says it acts in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Helixos’s projects are listed openly on its own website. It works with the Energy Policy Institute of Australia “on editing public policy papers to promote progressive, technology-inclusive energy policy”, including one focusing on “the ability of small modular reactors (SMRs) to support a ‘just transition’ for coal communities in Australia”. Helixos states it worked with SMR Nuclear Technology Pty Ltd “to develop a proactive stakeholder engagement strategy” to “help achieve the main goal of having nuclear energy considered as part of Australia’s future energy mix”. Robert Pritchard, who is both chair of SMR Nuclear Technology and executive director of the Energy Policy Institute of Australia, declined to comment. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said in his budget reply speech that the Coalition wanted “an intelligent conversation on the role that these new-age nuclear technologies might or might not be able to play” in Australia. Announcing the “grassroots community engagement program” on Friday, O’Brien said the starting point would be “an online survey that will open a two-way conversation with the Australian public about the benefits and concerns of advanced nuclear technology becoming part of Australia’s future energy mix”. “Other countries are reducing their emissions while keeping costs down and their network secure with nuclear energy,” O’Brien said. “The question is - should we? Together with the Australian people, let’s find out.” The survey has only three mandatory questions, starting with views on the benefits of nuclear energy in Australia. It then asks what concerns, if any, the participant holds about nuclear energy, followed by any questions they might have. There is an optional section to “stay informed” by submitting an email address and postcode to O’Brien’s team. O’Brien’s website also sets out frequently asked questions such as: “Is nuclear energy clean?” The answer states: “Yes! Nuclear power’s total life-cycle carbon emissions and raw material requirements are the lowest among other energy sources, even lower than wind and solar.” The climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, has previously accused the Coalition of pushing the nuclear debate as a “rearguard attempt to undermine and deny the transition to renewables”.",Australian politics; Energy; Nuclear power; Australia news; Coalition; Environment; Ted O'Brien,Australia news
2022-11-26T07:00:20Z,Rich nations have promised to pay for the climate crisis – but will they? |  Gordon Brown,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/26/rich-nations-climate-crisis-cop28-gordon-brown,"On Sunday, loud cheers from Sharm el-Sheikh greeted the announcement of a new initiative – the global loss and damage fund – to right historical wrongs by compensating climate-hit developing countries. This breakthrough brought back memories of another, the £100bn a year agreed at the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit to help poor countries mitigate the effects of the climate crisis. That money has never fully materialised. If our 13 years’ experience of the £100bn fund that never was is anything to go by, eulogies of praise will soon turn into allegations of betrayal. The president of next year’s Cop28 will have to answer for yet another fund without funders. Far from the loss and damage fund narrowing the credibility gap on climate action, it is likely to bridge nothing if money fails to flow from rich to poor. The last decade has been a history of promises made and broken. Before Covid, the cost of financing the sustainable development goals (SDGs) was $2.5tn a year. Now, post-Covid, and with the price of fighting floods, firestorms and droughts – and the debt burden of low-income countries – dramatically escalating, it is $4tn annually. Set against an official development assistance (ODA) budget of only $179bn a year and $130bn on offer mainly in multilateral loans, the SDGs represent yet another unanimous but unfunded pledge of the international community. To make matters worse, the British development aid budget has now been cut from 0.7% of our national income to 0.5% for years ahead, and already our overall contribution to meeting all our climate and development targets is down from the promised £16bn to just £11.5bn. But there is a way forward if we are to meet our goals. About $2tn (£1.75tn) will be needed each year by 2030 to help developing countries cut their greenhouse gas emissions. This could be paid for, if necessary, by raising global taxes like the airline levies pioneered by France and the UK. As the pathbreaking Bridgetown declaration, inspired by the prime minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, recommends, $100bn of special drawing rights (the international money issued by the IMF) should immediately be redistributed from rich to poor countries, with half going to finance green projects. President Macron’s June summit on climate finance should cancel the unpayable debt of low-income countries in return for those countries taking action on the climate. For those who can pay, debt repayments should be varied in the event of climate disasters. Public funds will never, as Bridgetown recognises, be enough, so it is vital that every pound, dollar and euro of aid is used to generate other sources of support. Mobilising private finance was the centrepiece of a seminal 2015 report from the IMF and the development banks. Governments, it proposed, should put in place the right incentives to encourage private finance to invest in climate breakdown and development. Indeed, the SDGs’ funding needs could be met if we mobilised just 1% each year of the $400tn financial assets held by banks, institutional investors and fund managers. Yet despite billions in pledges, good intentions and a flood of press releases publicising socially responsible environment, social and government projects, too little private investment is yet in play, leading to allegations of greenwashing. Pioneered by Ronald Cohen, impact investing, where corporate outlays are measured not only in risk and reward but in socially beneficial results, has the potential to fund clean energy, renewables and mitigation and adaptation. But this will almost certainly require legislation for impact-weighted accounting, so that alongside profit and loss, companies itemise in monetary terms the real-time social and environmental benefits of their activities. But all this will take time, and climate finance is needed urgently. It should be kickstarted immediately by transforming the World Bank into a global public goods bank. The international development association is the arm of the bank dedicated to the lowest-income countries. By borrowing on the strength of repaid loans, it can unlock more than $100bn in additional capital. Merging this with the bank’s facility that aids middle-income countries could then quadruple the bank’s capital base. Even more funds could be generated through the innovative use of guarantees offered to the regional development banks by the richest countries, and the Asian Development Bank is already planning to fund climate projects securing guarantees from European governments. If deployed across all multilateral banks, an initial $10bn in grants, some raised from global philanthropists, matched with $60bn of guarantees, could be used to raise a total of $270bn to support the transition to net zero, and, overall, our regional and international institutions could soon be investing not just billions but a trillion dollars each year. And funds could be guaranteed on a sustained basis if the world’s richest countries agreed to share the burden fairly, based on their capacity to pay. While this is a proven model, used in 1966 in an attempt to eliminate smallpox, today only $7bn of UN financing (for peacekeeping) and just $1bn of health financing (to pay 25% of the current World Health Organization budget) is currently raised through a burden-sharing formula. All the rest comes through passing around a begging bowl. A world addressing an existential challenge should not have to rely on charity. An action plan for Cop28 that requires donors to contribute to climate finance based on their capacity to pay – and, in the case of loss and damage, based on historic liability for greenhouse gas emissions – should be the starting point for the next round of climate finance. Adequately funding our global goals for the first time would be something to really cheer about. We have the means and the knowhow. What we now need is the political will.

2022-11-05T11:00:08Z,Africa is being devastated by a climate crisis it didn’t cause. Cop27 must help | Amina J Mohammed,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/05/africa-climate-crisis-cop27-drought-flooding-support,"I recently walked the parched earth of north-east Kenya and heard heartbreaking accounts of families slipping back into poverty. Across Africa, water shortages are expected to displace up to 700 million people this decade. The Horn of Africa is experiencing its worst drought in 40 years, with more than 50 million people suffering from hunger, unsure where their next meal is coming from. While some parts of the continent are gripped by drought, places such as South Sudan and my homeland, Nigeria, are experiencing devastating flash floods that sweep away homes, businesses and livelihoods. And up to 116 million Africans will face severe risks from rising sea levels this decade. As we approach the United Nations climate change conference, Cop27, in Egypt, we are living on borrowed time. Global emissions are at record levels and rising, while worsening climate chaos is wreaking havoc across our continent. The pre-Cop27 event I attended in October in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) put a spotlight on Africa’s specific climate vulnerabilities. But delegates also focused on the vast opportunities that ambitious joint climate action could create to drive progress across the sustainable development goals (SDGs). And so they should. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is a country brimming with immense potential and innovative climate solutions. It is home to most of the world’s second-largest rainforest, and has major deposits of cobalt, copper and aluminium – the minerals required for the key transformations we need for renewable energy and digital economies. The Congo basin has the ability to absorb around 1.2bn tonnes of carbon dioxide a year – 4% of global emissions. However, African nations cannot fight the climate crisis, protect their rich rainforests and safeguard their biodiversity alone. The international community must stand in solidarity with Africa and help to provide the significant resources needed. Africa requires $2.8tn by 2030 to play its part in limiting global heating to 1.5C and to address the impacts of climate change. Yet the whole continent received only $30bn of global climate finance in 2020. Ministers at the pre-Cop meeting in DRC made it clear that African countries need finance urgently to build resilience and adapt to the devastating impacts of a crisis they did nothing to cause. They called on developed countries to deliver on their promises, starting with the pledge made at last year’s Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow to double adaptation finance to at least $40bn annually. The failure of developed countries to honour their commitments is not just an injustice and a failure of global solidarity. It contributes to the serious tensions and divisions that are preventing global action on a host of other issues, from peace and security to human rights. As the late Archbishop Desmond Tutu said: “Exclusion is never the way forward on our shared paths to freedom and justice.” African countries need support from both public and private sources of finance, especially from the multilateral development banks. Vulnerable countries cannot make the shift to renewables and provide access to energy for all unless these banks overhaul their operating models. Governments are their shareholders and must use their influence to get the banks to step up. Many developing countries, including 15 in Africa, are heading into our current cost of living crisis while facing debt distress or default. They need fiscal space to invest in climate action and the SDGs. While some countries need comprehensive assistance to restructure their debt, the international community should also look at innovative solutions, including debt-for-climate adaptation and debt-for-nature swaps. The renewables revolution on the African continent will fail unless it expands access to energy. Some 600 million Africans still lack access to electricity. Achieving universal access will require massive investment in renewables, creating millions of jobs and driving economic development and prosperity. But it cannot add to the debt burden of African countries. African countries need a new generation of partnerships with donors, multilateral development banks and private financiers. The Just Energy Transition Partnerships – with a focus on phasing out coal and speeding up the deployment of renewables – are one innovative model. Climate action and the renewables revolution are not luxuries or add-on extras on the African continent. They are indivisible from building peace, security, stability and prosperity. The DRC itself has endured nearly three decades of conflict and fragility, and up to 5,000 children become soldiers each year. In DRC and elsewhere, climate change is exacerbating conflict by causing flooding, deforestation and drought, deepening poverty and competition for resources. I was encouraged by the frank dialogue between governments in Kinshasa. This is crucial to building trust – a prerequisite for joint climate action. But much more is needed to turn these murmurs of solidarity into gusting winds of change. The people of Africa need action. At Cop27 and beyond, they need concrete plans to deliver finance at scale, ensure a just transition to renewables, build climate resilience and address the loss and damage caused by this crisis.

2022-09-21T11:00:27Z,"Non-communicable diseases kill a person under 70 every two seconds, says WHO",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/sep/21/non-communicable-diseases-kill-a-person-under-70-every-two-seconds-says-who-acc,"Every two seconds someone under 70 dies of a non-communicable disease (NCDs), the majority of them in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), according to a new report by the World Health Organization. The WHO study, released today at the UN general assembly in New York, said that LMICs account for 86% of these premature deaths, most of which could be avoided or delayed if people had access to prevention, treatment and care. The diseases pose one of the greatest health and development challenges of the century but they are “overlooked and underfunded”, according to the report, entitled Invisible Numbers. Only a few countries remain on track to meet global development targets to reduce premature deaths from NCDs by a third by 2030, showing that the world is failing to take heed of the true extent of these diseases, which cause about 41m deaths each year, or 74% of all deaths globally. At least 17 million people die prematurely before the age of 70 every year due to NCDs, including heart disease, cancer, diabetes and respiratory disease. “The data paint a clear picture. The problem is that the world isn’t looking at it,” said the report, due to be presented at the UN for the first heads of state group focused on the prevention of NCDs, chaired by Nana Akufo-Addo, the president of Ghana. Even though people “instinctively understand why NCDs matter to individuals and families … this understanding of the individual health consequences has not translated into adequate action, either nationally or globally”, the report said. “This inaction is partly due to a failure to understand the scale of the toll that NCDs take on health, on equity and on economies.” Cardiovascular diseases (heart disease and stroke) kill more people than any other disease, accounting for one in three deaths a year or nearly 18m deaths. “Two-thirds of the people with hypertension live in LMICs, but almost half of the people with hypertension are not even aware they have it,” researchers said. About one in six deaths occur due to cancer, one in 13 due to chronic respiratory diseases and one in 28 are caused by diabetes. Tobacco use, unhealthy diets, harmful use of alcohol and physical inactivity are among the major risk factors leading to NCDs. More than 8m deaths every year are attributed to tobacco use; unhealthy diets account for a similar number. An NCD data portal containing the latest global data on NCDs, risk factors and policy implementation for 194 countries was released alongside the report. “NCDs undermine social development and are a handbrake on global development,” said Bente Mikkelsen, director of NCDs at WHO. “World leaders recognised the critical importance of NCDs in the sustainable development goals, aiming to reduce premature death from NCDs by one-third by 2030. But currently, just 14 of 194 countries globally are on track to achieve this goal.” Mikkelsen added that poorer people, especially women and young people, are often aggressively targeted by industry to use tobacco and alcohol, key risk factors for NCDs. “Millions don’t have access to the prevention, treatment and care that could save lives or give years of life back,” she added. Leanne Riley, one of the report’s authors, said NCDs do not get the attention and funding that is commensurate with their devastating impact. She said people living with NCDs face additional complications at the time of humanitarian crisis, such as during the conflict in Ukraine. “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine disrupted many health services – including insulin access for people with diabetes. About 9% of Ukrainian adults have raised blood sugar and, as the conflict escalated, millions of people living with diabetes were at risk of not being able to access the daily lifesaving medication they need,” she said. Riley referred to Rwanda’s success with its HPV vaccine rollout to tackle cervical cancer. In 2011, the country became the first African country to introduce a national HPV vaccination programme. Nearly 40m deaths could be averted by 2030 if countries adopted the interventions that are known to work, the report said. Only 5% of external aid for health in LMICs goes to prevention and control of NCDs. “This report confirms what we’ve long suspected – that chronic diseases are now beginning to outstrip infectious diseases as the main driver of mainly preventable ill health and death in lower- and middle-income countries,” said Katie Dain, CEO of the NCD Alliance. “We urgently need a major financial and public health reset by national governments and the global health community before it is too late.” “The imperative for action is clear and urgent,” Dain said. “NCDs will cost more suffering and lives this decade than any other health issue; will drain the global economy and impede human capital; will both fuel and be fuelled by the growing inequalities in our countries and globally; and will undermine any efforts to ensure the world is better prepared for future pandemics after Covid. Inaction and paralysis is not a viable option.”",Global health; Global development; World Health Organization; Health; Society; World news; Cancer; Diabetes; Heart disease,Global development
2022-10-06T07:00:31Z,People of colour have been shut out of the climate debate. Social justice is the key to the green agenda | Julian Agyeman,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/06/colour-climate-social-justice-green-environmental,"“Equity is not an issue for us. We’re here to save the world.” From 1986 to 1990, I worked in an inner London borough as an environmental policy adviser. I worked on raising awareness of local environmental issues, paying special attention to those affecting the borough’s lower-income residents. There were very few jobs such as this in local government, and I was the only Black person employed in one. Unlike the US, in Britain there was no policy discourse or social movement tackling environmental or climate justice at that time. Yet it was obvious to me through my work, and to a growing number of other activists of colour, that the poorest residents in urban Britain, many of whom were Black and Brown, lived in the most deprived areas in terms of proximity to large polluting roads, poor or unaffordable housing stock, social exclusion, lack of educational and economic opportunity, disinvestment and lack of green and play spaces. But these issues were being (actively) ignored by (white) environmental activists, who were focusing instead on their stock-in-trade issues: biodiversity, conservation and climate change (not climate justice). Further reinforcing the exclusivity of white environmental activist agendas, those employed in the environmental and emerging sustainability policy arenas were almost entirely white. In response to this exclusion, a group of activists of colour, including Ingrid Pollard, Judy Ling Wong, Roland de la Mothe, Vijay Krishnarayan, Swantee Toocaram and I founded the Black Environment Network (BEN) in 1988 to increase activism, reframe environmental and sustainability agendas and get more people of colour into environmental jobs. We had read the landmark report Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States (United Church of Christ, Commission for Racial Justice 1987) which had contributed significantly to the development of public awareness in the US of “environmental racism”: the intentional and disproportionate loading of environmental “bads” such as pollution and toxic waste on communities of colour, and the lack of access to environmental “goods”, such as parks and open spaces. The cry for a “justice” framing of environmental and sustainability issues was growing louder in the US, culminating in President Bill Clinton’s 1994 executive order called Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations. Environmental injustice was now a civil rights issue. At BEN, our evidence was largely anecdotal and remained so until Friends of the Earth’s groundbreaking 1999 report, Pollution Injustice: The Geographic Relation Between Household Income and Polluting Factories, that showed that low-income areas in Britain suffered most from industrial pollution. Race, however, was not factored into Friends of the Earth’s report, unlike Toxic Wastes and Race in the US. We argued that in Britain, like the US, income is a pretty good proxy for race. With this, and BEN’s work on “rural racism”, we had the beginnings of a British environmental justice agenda. On a personal level, the justice frame gave me my mantra, which, with every passing year, I’m more convinced is true: “The social justice perspective must be included in green campaign agendas because, short of coercive measures, true environmental wellbeing will only exist when there is human wellbeing.” Not everyone understood the need for this linkage at that time. While researching a TV programme in the early 1990s, I asked a staff member of a large international environmental organisation if she felt her employees reflected multicultural Britain. She replied calmly: “Equity is not an issue for us. We’re here to save the world.” While the concept of intersectionality was new at the time, the deep rupture between environmental activism on the one hand and the need for an equity framing on the other was widespread among activists and policymakers. Not only was this a major factor in keeping people of colour out of both the environmental movement and environmental jobs, but it also kept the “green” agenda away from tackling “social” issues such as poverty, racism, equity and justice. However, in recent years research has shown that the issue of environmental quality is inextricably linked to that of equity and human equality at all geographic scales. Wherever in the world environmental despoliation and degradation is happening, it is almost always linked to questions of social justice, human rights, racism, equity and people’s quality of life in its widest sense. From recent floods in Pakistan to excessive heat in formerly redlined US neighbourhoods, from pollution-related deaths such as Ella Kissi-Debrah who lived within 30 metres of London’s South Circular Road, to the toxic plight of the copper pickers at Agbogbloshie, the world’s largest e-waste dump in Accra, Ghana, the poorest are bearing the brunt of environmental “bads”, and in the case of climate “bads”, they are the least responsible for carbon production. Today, the situation among activists and policymakers is very different from the 1980s and 1990s. I would argue that it is the justice framing, which was initially called for by activists of colour, that has had the most impact on environmental and sustainability agendas worldwide. We now have the discourses of environmental justice, food justice and climate justice, white supremacy, decolonisation and oppression permeating mainstream environmental and sustainability agendas, activism and policy. We also have Kate Raworth’s equity-focused Doughnut Economics, the justice-focused Greenhouse Development Rights framework developed and modelled by the Stockholm Environment Institute, the UN Sustainable Development goals which more fully reflect poverty and inequality, racism, Indigenous and women’s rights, and we have Fridays for Future “strikes” in around 450 places worldwide, demanding that rich countries pay reparations for “loss and damage” due to global heating and climate-related disasters. We’ve come a long way, but there’s still a long way to go.

2022-06-21T10:00:59Z,Salmon firm’s plan to fly fish in its own Boeing 757 alarms campaigners,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/21/salmon-firm-plan-fly-fish-boeing-757-alarms-campaigners,"A salmon farming company has bought a Boeing 757 in a race to get its fresh fish on to the plates of diners in Manhattan in less than 24 hours. The Faroese firm Bakkafrost, which also owns the Scottish Salmon Company, argues it can cut its carbon footprint by flying its own jet across the Atlantic and minimise waste by getting its fish to its US customers faster. But sustainability campaigners say its transatlantic flights raise new questions about the climate impact of the global seafood industry and its increasing reliance on air freight to open new markets overseas. Fresh seafood such as salmon, tuna and lobster is often flown across the globe rather than being frozen or super-chilled for transport by ship. Campaigners calculate that flying salmon fillets from Scandinavia to the US produces 17 times more CO2 than travel by boat. Bakkafrost’s 757 is being converted into a flying fridge capable of carrying 35 tonnes of fresh salmon, chilled to zero degrees, from the Faroe Isles, an archipelago midway between Scotland and Iceland, direct to an airport in New Jersey. Harvested that day, it would arrive in time to reach US wholesalers and restaurants early the next morning. Bakkafrost plans to fly other freight back to the Faroes or Scottish airports to reduce operating costs and is considering extra flights to take Scottish salmon to New York. Regin Jacobsen, Bakkafrost’s chief executive, said direct flights in a ready-chilled hold would cut the firm’s CO2 emissions from air freight by 45%. It currently flies salmon to the US via Heathrow, which increases the flying time and needs large amounts of ice to keep the fish cool. Jacobsen said the strategy would help meet his firm’s pledge to cut its carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 and to net zero by 2050, in line with United Nations sustainable development goals. Air freight, he added, was only a small proportion of its overall exports. It shipped thousands of tonnes by sea every week. “Reducing our carbon footprint to the US is a huge step and it’s very important our customers get high-quality produce,” he said. “By reducing transportation times, it means consumers in New York and the east coast have very fresh produce and reduced food waste.” Bakkafrost’s strategy is controversial within the salmon farming industry. Its Faroese rival Hiddenfjord stopped all air freight in October 2020 and instead uses ships to reach US customers; the nine-day voyages have cut its carbon footprint by 94%, at a 10th of the price of flying. Blake Lee-Harwood of the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership, which advises supermarkets on climate- and environment-friendly fisheries policies, said the firm should be pursuing the lowest-carbon technologies instead of simply cutting flying time. Worldwide, air freight is increasingly used to sell and distribute premium seafood. Live Canadian lobsters are flown to Shanghai in China, Chilean salmon to New York, and Norwegian salmon flown to Japan. Industry studies calculate 18% of Norway’s fresh salmon is air freighted to customers, representing 50% of Norwegian salmon farming’s total carbon emissions. “Climate change is an existential threat to the seafood industry and to global livelihoods. We think the seafood industry has to be part of the solution by demonstrating absolute best practice. That inevitably means a move away from air transport, certainly for farmed salmon,” Lee-Harwood said. Kath Dalmeny, the chief executive of Sustain, which campaigns on food and farming, said: “We’re in a climate and nature emergency. Globally, the way we produce our food is responsible for up to 30% of emissions. “Rather than finding ways to fly food even more quickly from one side of the world to the other, we should all be endeavouring to create a food system that nourishes the planet’s population and allows nature to recover.”",Fishing; Fishing industry; Food; Faroe Islands; Scotland; Greenhouse gas emissions; Animals; Conservation; Marine life; Environment; Air transport; World news; UK news; Business,Environment
2022-07-06T14:00:16Z,Global hunger toll soars by 150 million as Covid and Ukraine war make their mark,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jul/06/global-hunger-toll-soars-by-150-million-as-covid-and-ukraine-war-make-their-mark,"The number of people going hungry in the world has risen by 150 million since the start of the Covid pandemic, the UN has said, warning that the food crisis sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine risks pushing the worst-hit countries into famine. Globally, the number suffering from chronic undernourishment rose to as many as 828 million last year, a rise of about 46 million on the previous year, and three times that increase if measured since the world shut down due to Covid, a report has found. With the price of fuel, food staples and fertiliser soaring since the invasion of Ukraine, however, that total is expected to rise even further in the next year – a scenario that could see some of the world’s poorest fall into famine, the most extreme form of food deprivation. “There is a real danger these numbers will climb even higher in the months ahead,” said David Beasley, executive director of the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP). “The global price spikes in food, fuel and fertilisers as a result of the crisis in Ukraine threaten to push countries around the world into famine. “The result will be global destabilisation, starvation and mass migration on an unprecedented scale,” he warned. “We have to act today to avert this looming catastrophe.” Due to the uncertainty caused by the lingering impact of Covid shutdowns, the report, released on Wednesday, is unable to give a precise figure for the number of people going hungry in 2021, instead estimating that the total was somewhere between 702 million and 828 million. If the latter, that would equate to about 10.5% of the world population. An estimated 45 million children under five were suffering from wasting, the deadliest form of malnutrition, which increases children’s risk of death by up to 12 times, the report said. About 149 million children under five had stunted growth and development due to a chronic lack of essential nutrients. Gilbert Houngbo, president of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), said that, according to projections, chronic undernourishment would affect nearly 670 million people in 2030 – a similar figure to that of 2015, when the UN vowed to eradicate hunger by 2030 as part of the sustainable development goals. “[It] means all the effort in those 15 years will have been wiped out by the different crises that the world is going through,” he told the Guardian. Houngbo, a former prime minister of Togo, agreed there was a distinct risk of famine in some countries, but added: “I want to believe there’s still time for us to avoid arriving there.” The one “silver lining” of the Ukraine crisis, he added, was that the world had been forced to pay attention to vulnerabilities in the global food system. Urging the international community to “seize the moment” and make “a decisive shift” in agricultural policy, he said: “Investment in resilience is the real answer. If famine were to happen, food distribution might be unavoidable. “But for God’s sake, food aid is not the answer,” he added. “And today, if we invest in the resilience of the local producers, we can avoid that famine.” The tool used by the UN and wider international community to measure food insecurity – the integrated food security phase classification (IPC) defines famine as an extreme deprivation of food. “Starvation, death, destitution and extremely critical levels of acute malnutrition are or will likely be evident,” it says. The last famine to be officially declared was in some areas of South Sudan in 2017. Before that, a famine in Somalia is estimated to have killed nearly 260,000 people between 2010 and 2012. Both countries continue to suffer acute food insecurity, and a WFP spokesman warned last month that only a massive humanitarian effort could prevent parts of Somalia from returning to famine in coming months. The 2022 edition of The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report was jointly published by the Food and Agriculture Organization, IFAD, Unicef, WFP and the World Health Organization.",Hunger; Global development; Famine; World news; United Nations; Society; Malnutrition; Children; Ukraine; Europe; Migration and development,Global development
2022-09-09T10:38:26Z,"‘A new way of life’: the Marxist, post-capitalist, green manifesto captivating Japan",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/09/a-new-way-of-life-the-marxist-post-capitalist-green-manifesto-captivating-japan,"The climate crisis will spiral out of control unless the world applies “emergency brakes” to capitalism and devises a “new way of living”, according to a Japanese academic whose book on Marxism and the environment has become a surprise bestseller. The message from Kohei Saito, an associate professor at Tokyo University, is simple: capitalism’s demand for unlimited profits is destroying the planet and only “degrowth” can repair the damage by slowing down social production and sharing wealth. In practical terms, that means an end to mass production and the mass consumption of wasteful goods such as fast fashion. In Capital in the Anthropocene, Saito also advocates decarbonisation through shorter working hours and prioritising essential “labour-intensive” work such as caregiving. ‘I was as surprised as everyone else’ Few would have expected Saito’s Japanese-language solution to the climate crisis to have much appeal outside leftwing academia and politics. Instead, the book – which was inspired by Karl Marx’s writings on the environment – has become an unlikely hit, selling more than half a million copies since it was published in September 2020. As the world confronts more evidence of the effects of climate change – from floods in Pakistan to heatwaves in Britain – rampant inflation and the energy crisis, Saito’s vision of a more sustainable, post-capitalist world will appear in an academic text to be published next year by Cambridge University Press, with an English translation of his bestseller to follow. “It is broadly about what’s going on in the world … about the climate crisis and what we should do about it,” Saito said in an interview with the Guardian. “I advocate for degrowth and going beyond capitalism.” The mere mention of the world degrowth conjures negative images of wealthy societies plunged into a dark age of shrinking economies and declining living standards. Saito admits that he thought a book that draws on strands of Marxism as a solution to modern-day ills would be a tough sell in Japan, where the same conservative party has dominated politics for the best part of 70 years. “People accuse me of wanting to go back to the [feudal] Edo period [1603-1868] … and I think the same sort of image persists in the UK and the US,” he said. “Against that background, for the book to sell over 500,000 copies is astonishing. I was as surprised as everyone else.” The 35-year-old needn’t have worried about using the language of radical change; as the world emerges from the pandemic and confronts the existential threat posed by global heating, disillusionment with the economic status quo has given him a receptive audience. The pandemic has magnified inequalities in advanced economies, and between the global north and south – and the book struck a nerve with younger Japanese. “Saito is telling a story that is easy to understand,” says Jun Shiota, a 31-year-old researcher who bought Capital in the Anthropocene soon after it was published. “He doesn’t say there are good and bad things about capitalism, or that it is possible to reform it … he just says we have to get rid of the entire system. “Young people were badly affected by the pandemic and face other big issues such as environmental destruction and the cost of living crises, so that simple message resonates with them.” Saito agrees that growing inequality has given his writing more immediacy. “Many people lost their jobs and homes and are relying on things like food banks, even in Japan. I find that shocking. And you have essential workers who are forced to work long hours in low-paid jobs. The marginalisation of essential workers is becoming a serious issue.” The response to Covid-19 had shown that rapid change is not only desirable, but possible, he says. “One thing that we have learned during the pandemic is that we can dramatically change our way of life overnight – look at the way we started working from home, bought fewer things, flew and ate out less. We proved that working less was friendlier to the environment and gave people a better life. But now capitalism is trying to bring us back to a ‘normal’ way of life.” ‘Marx was interested in sustainability’ Saito is deeply sceptical of some widely accepted strategies for tackling the climate emergency. “In my book, I start a sentence by describing sustainable development goals [SDGs] as the new opium of the masses,” he said in reference to Marx’s view of religion. “Buying eco bags and bottles without changing anything about the economic system … SDGs mask the systemic problem and reduce everything to the responsibility of the individual, while obscuring the responsibility of corporations and politicians.” “I discovered how Marx was interested in sustainability and how non-capitalist and pre-capitalist societies are sustainable, because they are realising the stationary economy, they are not growth-driven,” Saito said. Since the book was released, Saito has made Japan noticeably less squeamish about the German philosopher’s ideas. The conservative public broadcaster NHK gave him four 25-minute segments to explain his ideas for its Masterpiece in 100 Minutes series, while bookshop chains cleared space for special displays of revivalist Marxist literature. Now he hopes his message will appeal to an English-language readership. “We face a very difficult situation: the pandemic, poverty, climate change, the war in Ukraine, inflation … it is impossible to imagine a future in which we can grow the economy and at the same time live in a sustainable manner without fundamentally changing anything about our way of life. “If economic policies have been failing for 30 years, then why don’t we invent a new way of life? The desire for that is suddenly there.” • This article was amended on 9 September 2022.

2022-06-23T12:20:11Z,Britain ranks bottom in Europe for nature connectedness,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/23/britain-ranks-bottom-in-europe-for-nature-connectiveness,"From the romantic poets to the global reach of Sir David Attenborough, Britain has a reputation for being a nation of nature lovers. But the citizens of this supposedly green and pleasant land are ranked bottom of 14 European nations measured for their “nature connectedness”, according to a new study. Nature connectedness is a psychological concept that measures the closeness of an individual’s relationship with other species and the wild world. Studies have found that people with a high level of nature connectedness enjoy better mental health and are more likely to act in environmentally friendly ways. The study, published in the journal Ambio, examines which countrywide factors influence the degree of individual closeness to nature, finding the strongest association between biodiversity and nature connectedness, with individuals living in countries where wild species and landscapes are still intact enjoying a closer relationship with nature. Britain is bottom of the 14 nations for biodiversity, having lost more wildlife than any other G7 country and been shown to be one of the most nature-depleted countries on the planet. Another country-wide factor in nature connectedness was the average age of a population, with older people tending to enjoy closer relationships with nature – possibly because there was more around when they were children or they had more freedom to enjoy it. While high levels of urban residents did not necessarily mean a weaker connection with nature, more decisive negative influences on nature connection were higher average incomes and smartphone ownership. Countries with a high level of smartphone ownership were strongly associated with a more distant relationship to nature. Another study has found that people who take lots of selfies experience less connection with the natural world. The latest study also supports previous research showing that new technology is more significant than urbanisation in the decline of nature words in cultural products since the 1950s. Prof Miles Richardson of the University of Derby, the lead author, said: “We’re a nation of nature lovers, we cherish our poets, we celebrate our landscape artists and we love our nature documentaries – there is that perception we’re a nation of nature lovers but it hurts to be told that what this data strongly suggests is no, it’s not the case.” He said it was too simplistic to infer that smartphones were a cause of a loss of connection with nature, but it was part of a spiral of decline in Britain. “When you’ve lost your biodiversity, you’ve lost your opportunity to engage with it,” he said. “At the same time you’ve got these new opportunities to engage with smartphones or whatever the latest technology is. It’s difficult to make a causal inference but it’s probably a spiral of decline – biodiversity drops, a relationship with nature drops and biodiversity falls further and around you go.” Analysing data from 14,745 adults across the European countries including Germany, Spain, France and Italy, researchers found British people have the lowest nature connectedness, a ranking of 3.71 out of a possible 7. Italy has the highest nature-connected citizens, with a ranking of 4.67. Other high-ranking nations are in southern or central Europe, such as Portugal, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria, while north European nations showed the least affinity with the natural world, with Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden and Ireland making up the bottom five above the UK. According to Richardson, the measurement of “nature connectedness” could become a useful tool in tackling the biodiversity crisis because the concept does not adopt the dominant western view of humans and nature as separate but captures it as a relationship – as many pre-industrial societies and eastern philosophies have done. “Although we can’t reduce our relationship with nature down to one number, the world operates with numbers and there are times we need to put figures in front of someone and convince them that something needs to be done,” said Richardson. “It’s one measure for one health – a simple measurement for the health of humans and nature. “We seek to restore natural habitats but habitat and biodiversity loss is a symptom of a failing relationship with nature, and now people are seeing that relationship as the root cause of a decline in nature. [The concept of nature connection] has got a lot to offer mental health as well. If we’ve got one target to deliver two benefits for people and the rest of the nature that seems a wonderful thing.” Richardson is calling for the UN to adopt the concept of nature connectedness as a sustainable target, with its 17 sustainable development goals currently either focused on issues for people or for nature. “We rarely focus on the interface, on the relationship,” he said. “Sometimes we’re so disconnected we don’t see the relationship as a tangible thing at all.”",Access to green space; Environment; UK news,Environment
2022-02-24T08:00:16Z,Revealed: leading climate research publisher helps fuel oil and gas drilling,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/24/elsevier-publishing-climate-science-fossil-fuels,"Scientists working with one of the world’s largest climate research publishers say they’re increasingly alarmed that the company works with the fossil fuel industry to help increase oil and gas drilling, the Guardian can reveal. Elsevier, a Dutch company behind many renowned peer-reviewed scientific journals, including the Lancet and Global Environmental Change, is also one of the top publishers of books aimed at expanding fossil fuel production. For more than a decade, the company has supported the energy industry’s efforts to optimize oil and gas extraction. It commissions authors, editors and journal advisory board members who are employees at top oil firms. Elsevier also markets some of its research portals and data services directly to the oil and gas industry to help “increase the odds of exploration success”. Several former and current employees say that for the past year, dozens of workers have spoken out internally and at company-wide town halls to urge Elsevier to reconsider its relationship with the fossil fuel industry. “When I first started, I heard a lot about the company’s climate commitments,” said a former Elsevier journal editor who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity. “Eventually I just realized it was all marketing, which is really upsetting because Elsevier has published all the research it needs to know exactly what to do if it wants to make a meaningful difference.” What makes Elsevier’s ties to the fossil fuel industry particularly alarming to its critics is that it is one of a handful of companies that publish peer-reviewed climate research. Scientists and academics say they’re concerned that Elsevier’s conflicting business interests risk undermining their work. Julia Steinberger, a social ecologist and ecological economist at the Université de Lausanne who has published studies in several Elsevier journals, said she was shocked to hear that the company took an active role in expanding fossil fuel extraction. “Elsevier is the publisher of some of the most important journals in the environmental space,” she said. “They cannot claim ignorance of the facts of climate change and the urgent necessity to move away from fossil fuels.” She added: “Their business model seems to be to profit from publishing climate and energy science, while disregarding the most basic fact of climate action: the urgent need to move away from fossil fuels.” Elsevier and its parent company, RELX, say they are committed to supporting the fossil fuel industry as it transitions toward clean energy. And while Elsevier has emerged as an industry leader with its own climate pledges, a spokesperson for the company said they are not prepared to draw a line between the transition away from fossil fuels and the expansion of oil and gas extraction. She voiced concern about publishers boycotting or “canceling” oil and gas firms. “We recognize that we are imperfect and we have to do more, but that shouldn’t negate all of the amazing work we have done over the past 15 years,” Márcia Balisciano, founding global head of corporate responsibility at RELX, told the Guardian. Of the more than 2,000 scholarly journals that Elsevier publishes, only seven are specific to fossil fuel extraction (14 if you count special publications and subsidiaries). Those journals include Upstream Oil and Gas Technology, the editor-in-chief of which works for Shell, and Unconventional Resources, which is edited by a Chevron researcher. It also runs a subsidiary book publisher, Gulf Publishing, which includes titles such as The Shale Oil and Gas Handbook and Strategies for Optimizing Petroleum Exploration. Elsevier also provides consultancy services to corporate clients. For the past 12 years, it has marketed a tool called Geofacets to fossil fuel companies. Geofacets combines thousands of maps and studies to make it easier to find and access oil and gas reserves, in addition to locations for wind farms or carbon storage facilities. The company claims the tool cuts research time by 50% and helps identify “riskier, more remote areas that had previously been inaccessible”. Top climate scientists, including those published in Elsevier’s own journals, however, say just the opposite must happen in order to avert a climate catastrophe. Limiting warming to 1.5C or less requires a worldwide decrease in fossil fuel production with more than 80% of all proven reserves left in the ground. “We will not comment on the practices of individual companies, but any actions actively supporting the expansion of fossil fuel development are indeed inconsistent” with the United Nations’ sustainable development goals, said Sherri Aldis, acting deputy director for the UN department of global communications. RELX is an astoundingly profitable company, with annual revenues topping $9.8bn, about a third of which are brought in by Elsevier. Balisciano emphasizes that fossil fuel content represents less than 1% of Elsevier’s publishing revenue, and less than half of Geofacets’ revenue, which itself represents only about 2% of Elsevier’s earnings. RELX and Elsevier say the bulk of their work supports and enables an energy transition via publications centered on clean energy. “We don’t want to draw a binary and we don’t think you can just flip a switch, but we have been reducing our involvement with fossil fuel activities while increasing the amount of research we publish on climate and clean energy,” said Esra Erkal, executive vice president of communications at Elsevier. *** Elsevier is not alone in navigating relationships with both climate researchers and fossil fuel executives. Multiple other publishers of peer-reviewed climate research have signed on to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals Publishers Compact while also partnering with the oil and gas industry in various ways. The UK-based publisher Taylor &amp; Francis, for example, signed the UN pledge and released its own net-zero commitments while also touting its publishing partnership with “industry leader” ExxonMobil, the oil company most linked to obstructionism on climate in the public consciousness. Another top climate publisher, Wiley, also signed on to the sustainability compact while publishing multiple books and journals aimed at helping the industry find and drill for more oil and gas. “It’s problematic,” said Dr Kimberly Nicholas, associate professor of sustainability science at Lund University in Sweden, noting that while corporate greenwashing is rampant across multiple industries, the publishers of peer-reviewed climate research have a unique responsibility. “If the same publisher putting out the papers that show definitively we can’t burn any more fossil fuels and stay within this carbon budget is also helping the fossil fuel industry do just that, what does that do to the whole premise of validity around the climate research? That is what’s deeply concerning about these conflicts,” she said. Ben Franta, a researcher at Stanford University who has also published studies in Elsevier journals, notes that the publisher’s relationship with oil firms is indicative of just how entwined that industry is with so many other aspects of society. “This all happens without the broader public knowing, and it operates to entrench the industry,” he said. “To effect a rapid replacement of fossil fuels, I believe these entanglements will need to be exposed and reformed.” Elsevier, for its part, emphasizes the role of editorial independence. “We wouldn’t want to tell journal editors what they can and can’t publish,” Balisciano said. However, such conflicts often place researchers in a tough position to navigate. James Dyke, assistant director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter, was surprised that Elsevier would be working to contradict climate researchers in this way. “It’s hard to believe that a company that publishes research about the dangers of the climate and ecological crises is the very same company that actively works with oil and gas companies to extract more fossil fuels, which drags us towards disaster,” he said.",Climate science; Climate crisis; Publishing; Environment; Science,Environment
2022-09-13T04:01:05Z,‘The strain is the worst of my lifetime’: how Bill Gates is staying optimistic ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/13/the-strain-is-the-worst-of-my-lifetime-how-bill-gates-is-staying-optimistic,"The figures are bad, progress has stalled and all the trends that had been building hope in the world becoming a fairer place are showing sharp about-turns. Yet Bill Gates, who has poured billions of his own dollars into eradicating poverty, remains “optimistic”. “It would be awful to turn away just because we’re getting bad grades due to unexpected setbacks,” he told the Guardian in an exclusive interview ahead of Tuesday’s publication of the annual Goalkeepers Report from the foundation he co-chairs. As the UN general assembly prepares to meet in New York next week, the report makes clear that most of the 17 sustainable development goals agreed by member countries in 2015, a “shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet”, will miss their 2030 deadline. “When we set the goals, we definitely did not expect something like the pandemic,” said Gates. “If we keep funding development aid properly we’ll get back where we were before the pandemic within a couple of years and build from there. But at best you can say it was a three- or four-year setback. In some areas, even worse. “If you just look at rates of childhood vaccinations then the pandemic was a huge setback,” he added. “We’re back at 2009 levels of vaccine coverage.” But keeping funding flowing is key, and Gates fears generosity towards Africa’s needs could be affected by “costs and distraction” from the Ukraine war. Another distraction during the Covid pandemic was that the 66-year-old Gates became a target for conspiracy theorists. “There have been a few cases where I’ve run into people in public where they are yelling at me that I’m putting chips into people and that’s kind of strange to see: ‘Wow, those people really exist, it’s not just some robot sending out crazy messages.’ “I think it is starting to die down,” he said. “I hope so, it’s tragic if it made people more reluctant to trust vaccines or to wear a mask where they should have. “It was quite a phenomenon; here in the US, it focused on myself and Tony Fauci, and internationally it was more just me because they didn’t know who Tony was, he really missed out on that! “But you know in some ways you don’t want to make fun of it either. Although it’s the only way rationally to deal with it, it is pretty serious stuff. The innovations on how you get the truth have to be as interesting as the big lie – we face that in a number of domains, and I haven’t seen as good a solution as I think we’d all like to see.” In July, the Microsoft billionaire and his ex-wife Melinda French Gates announced they were putting another $20bn (£17.1bn) into the charitable foundation they continue, post-divorce, to co-chair. How harmoniously, few in the pair’s large purpose-built Seattle headquarters are close enough to know, but it brought the total endowment to $70bn and it shows no sign of faltering in being a major player in the fight against poverty, particularly in Africa, and is raising its annual budget by 50%. One of the projects the foundation contributes to is the Guardian’s Global Development website (see footnote). “It is about human lives, it’s about a child surviving, it’s about women being given the opportunity to be educated and to be part of the economy, and it’s about people not having enough food,” said Gates. “Even before the pandemic, agricultural improvement for Africa, giving them the best seeds possible, was dramatically underfunded. Yet Africa has over 30% of children malnourished, which means their brains and bodies never fully develop, and that’s about the agricultural system. Poor food doesn’t make sense because the cost of land, the cost of labour, is low, so farming should be their advantage. “But the fact that they are facing, because of climate change, far more difficult growing conditions than ever and that that climate change was completely caused by rich-world greenhouse gas emissions … if the world is at all serious about climate adaptation as opposed to mitigation, then we’d certainly be funding a seed research system. We’d be fully funding that.” The foundation has shifted emphasis towards farming in recent years – something that has attracted criticism and controversy. Some African voices have expressed concern about not having a space at the table for discussions, while small-scale farmers fear that their environmental worries might be overlooked in the push towards big agriculture and corporate, science-led interventions. Gates has what has been described as an “evangelical” attitude towards gene editing technology. “Africa needs to feed its rural populations, it needs to feed its urban populations, and when you get food shortages, it’s not just the malnutrition and potential starvation which is bad, you also get incredible instability and that feeds into not being able to build infrastructure or run your education system. “So for Africa, particularly in the area we call the Sahel, it’s a dire situation and the only offset to that is that we could, if we are intent on it, make Africa self-sufficient in 15 years,” he said. “But we have to give better farmer education, better access to fertiliser and better seeds, and when those things come together, not only for the male farmers but also for the female farmers, then you see’ll huge productivity increases.” As the slew of problems the world faces fans out ever wider, it makes it harder to decide where budgets can be best spent. “Absolutely, we’re feeling that pressure – just the Ukraine war alone, you want to spend more money on defence, you want to subsidise electricity, you want to fund refugees, you want to help with the acute food crisis. “Which is somewhat different to helping with the long-term Africa productivity crisis, so the strain on budgets, particularly European budgets, is greater today than anytime in my lifetime.” But cutting back on health spending, he believes, would be “tragic”. “In the two keys areas of health and agriculture, the impact on saving lives and creating stability is very, very dramatic. “I wrote a memo when I put the extra $20bn into the foundation, saying ‘I’m not doing this because the near term looks super-rosy’, and that’s true, I’m doing it because these are important issues and in the long run I still am an optimist, that the war will end, the innovation pipeline and the kind of progress we saw until the pandemic in reducing malnutrition, reducing child death and getting digital bank accounts for women, will return. We were making progress and we can again. “Overall, it is a very challenging situation but we’re asking people: ‘just because it’s tough, don’t turn away.’ It’s literally about millions of lives and the very stability of these African governments that, when things go well, they are able to lift their country out of poverty and become self-sufficient. Aid has overall been very, very effective. “In the face of all these bleak developments,” he said, “the need to invest, to get the better tools, to get back on track, is very important. “Although we’ll miss 2030, we will hit the goals.

2022-03-17T23:30:41Z,"Almost a third of disabled children and teenagers face abuse, global study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/17/almost-a-third-of-disabled-children-and-teenagers-face-abuse-global-study-finds,"About one-third of young children and teenagers with disabilities faced emotional and physical abuse, while 20% experience neglect and one in 10 sexual violence, according to international research. Analysis involving more than 16 million young people from 25 countries conducted between 1990 and 2020, published in The Lancet Child &amp; Adolescent Health journal, shows that 31.7% of children with disabilities have experienced violence. They are twice as likely to face neglect and/or sexual, physical or mental abuse than children with no disabilities. They are also far more likely to be bullied by their peers. Researchers from Leeds, Oxford, Beijing and Columbia universities examined data measuring violence against children with disabilities published in Chinese and English studies between 1990 and 2020. They included 75 studies from high-income countries and 23 studies from seven low-income and middle-income countries. The report also showed that violence is more common against children with mental disorders and cognitive or learning disabilities than for children with sensory impairments, physical or mobility limitations, and chronic diseases. “Our findings reveal unacceptable and alarming rates of violence against children with disabilities that cannot be ignored,” said Jane Barlow, professor of evidence based intervention and policy evaluation at the University of Oxford, who co-led the study. Higher rates of violence occurred in low-income countries. Stigma, discrimination, lack of information about disability, and inadequate access to social support for carers were contributory factors, as well as poverty and social isolation, the authors conclude. Zuyi Fang from Beijing Normal University in China and co-lead author, said: “It is clear that low-and middle-income countries, in particular, face additional challenges, fuelled by complex social and economic drivers, and must establish legal frameworks to prevent violence, alongside increasing the capacity of health and social service systems to address the complex needs of children with disabilities and their families.” As the data largely predates the Covid-19 pandemic, the situation today is likely to be much worse, said Tania King, a senior research fellow at the University of Melbourne. Lockdowns and job losses have increased familial stress, while increasing the isolation and risks to vulnerable children, including those with disabilities. “Rates of violence against children with disabilities are likely to have increased during the pandemic,” she said. An estimated 291 million children and adolescents have epilepsy, intellectual disability, vision impairment, or hearing loss, representing about 11% of the global total child and adolescent population. Many millions more have other physical, cognitive and mental disabilities, or chronic diseases. Extrapolating the figures out among this population means about 90 million could have suffered violence. The UN sustainable development goals aim to end all forms of violence against children by 2030. Yet more than 1 billion children are estimated to experience violence – directly or indirectly – each year. Responding to the findings, Vladimir Cuk, executive director of the International Disability Alliance, an umbrella organisation representing 14 international and regional disability charities and NGOs, said: “It is not surprising that children with disabilities, especially those in residential institutions, experience all sorts of violence and mistreatment at a higher rate than others. “We could not stress more the need for urgent action by states and relevant stakeholders to prevent these abuses and prosecute perpetrators of violence.”",Children; Disability; Society; World news,Society
2022-06-25T20:00:24Z,"‘A finite resource’: as Australia recruits overseas health workers, their home nations bear the cost",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jun/26/a-finite-resource-as-australia-recruits-overseas-health-workers-their-home-nations-bear-the-cost,"Moving to Australia from New Zealand was not a decision Ava* made lightly. “We moved to New Zealand for the big Kiwi dream,” she says. “The country was beautiful, the lifestyle we had was magnificent.” Originally from the UK, Ava has been a nurse for over 20 years. But after more than a decade working in hospitals there, where she says she encountered bullying, she was at the end of her tether. “When we decided that enough was enough, that my career wasn’t going anywhere … and the working life of bullying and put-downs was just not worth it any more, we looked more closely at Australia,” she says. Ava took up short-term contract work in Australia before she and her family made the move permanently. She now lives in Queensland, and worked throughout the Covid pandemic. “I’m on a hell of a lot more money here than what I was in New Zealand,” she says. “That wasn’t my big driving force, but I know that’s a big driver for other nurses who have moved from New Zealand to Australia.” When the New South Wales government announced a $4.5bn pledge in early June to boost the state’s health workforce by more than 10,000 over four years, the news was received frostily across the Tasman. The chief executive of the New Zealand Nurses Organisation, Paul Goulter, expressed concern that the recruitment drive – which is set to hire 7,500 doctors, nurses and allied health professionals over the following 12 months – would result in more staff being lost to Australia. “Whilst there’s always been a number of nurses and other healthcare workers go backwards and forwards, there’s a real sense that it’s so bad over here that we may lose more than what we would normally,” Goulter told Radio New Zealand. Other Australian states have announced similar campaigns to attract healthcare workers from overseas. The Queensland government announced this week that it would target foreign doctors and nurses for recruitment, while Western Australia’s relocation incentive, which ends this month, includes a reimbursement of $5,000 for flights to Perth. Health workers have been migrating internationally for decades, moving for better pay, better working conditions, or the allure of a different lifestyle. But as countries focus recruitment efforts internationally to ease domestic pressures, experts warn that it may worsen existing inequalities amid a global shortage of healthcare workers. A global shortfall The Covid-19 pandemic exerted a heavy toll on health systems around the world. The World Health Organization estimates that up to 180,000 healthcare workers died globally between January 2020 and May last year as a result of Covid. More than 75 countries have put in place regulatory mechanisms to make it easier to recruit international healthcare workers, says James Campbell, the director of health workforce at the WHO. “The longstanding underinvestment in health systems meant that when additional demands were placed on health systems they didn’t have the capacity to respond,” he says. “Many … countries around the world had to rapidly look for additional recruitment mechanisms.” Even before the pandemic, there was a large shortfall in healthcare professionals. A WHO report estimated that in 2018 there was a shortage of 5.9 million nurses, who account for the majority – about 59% – of the health workforce. The report also found that one in eight nurses globally works in a different country from where they were born. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The US, UK, Germany, Finland, Australia and New Zealand are among the top destination countries for migrating nurses, says Howard Catton, the chief executive of the International Council of Nurses, which represents more than 130 national nurse associations. India and the Philippines – which “very deliberately educat[es] more nurses than they need” – have historically been sources of high numbers of migrant nurses, he says. The ICN has noted that the pandemic has driven up the demand for nurses in destination countries, with the number of nurse vacancies almost doubling in Canada and the UK. Recruitment drives in wealthy countries risk exacerbating stark inequalities that predate the pandemic, Catton says. “If you look at statistics around the numbers of nurses per head of population … you can see a tenfold difference, sometimes more, between low- or lower-middle-income countries and higher-income countries.” Figures range from 10 to 15 nurses per 10,000 people in some African and south-east Asian countries to more than 100 per 10,000 in the US or UK, Catton says. “If you’re a high-income country and you haven’t educated enough nurses to meet your own needs and then you decide to recruit from somewhere else to fill those needs … you’re offloading the costs of education for that nurse.” But healthcare worker migration is “not uniquely a movement from the global south to the global north,” Campbell says, noting there had also been shifts across OECD countries. Dana*, who works for an international recruitment agency for nurses in Australia, says most of the health workers she encounters are migrating from the UK and Ireland, many of whom previously worked in Covid wards or intensive care units. “They’ve had a hard time in Europe over the last two years or so,” she says. “Opportunities are better here as well. The healthcare system is impeccable [in Australia], so it’s not as tough to be a nurse here as it is [there], especially during Covid times.” Prior to the pandemic, the WHO estimated a shortage of 18 million health workers by 2030 – most of these in low- and lower-middle-income countries. Burnout among fatigued health workers may only worsen the problem. The ICN estimates an additional 3 million nurses may quit early as a result of Covid-19, and has been concerned by an increase in industrial action globally. Greater investment in health systems are needed to handle future increases in healthcare demand due to growing and ageing populations, Catton says. “We think that all countries should aim for self-sufficiency,” he says. “That doesn’t mean that people can’t move and migrate, but … we would like to see countries planning to produce enough nurses to meet their own needs.” “We have the global ambition of universal health coverage as part of the sustainable development goals,” Campbell says. Achieving this requires more than just the international movement of a finite – and insufficient – number of healthcare workers. “You can’t have global competition for a finite resource,” he says. “You need global collaboration.” *some names have been changed",Nursing; Australia news; UK news; Health; New Zealand,Society
2023-01-07T07:00:13Z,‘It altered my entire worldview’: leading authors pick eight nonfiction books to change your mind,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/07/it-altered-my-entire-worldview-leading-authors-pick-eight-nonfiction-books-to-change-your-mind,"Steven Pinker Shortly after publishing my book The Better Angels of Our Nature, on the historical decline of violence, I attended a conference sponsored by a foreign policy magazine at which a journalist asked me: “What would it take to eliminate extreme poverty worldwide?” Thinking it was a trick question, I quipped: “Redefine ‘poverty’.” An eavesdropping economist said to me: “That was a cynical answer”, and recommended a short new book by the development expert Charles Kenny called Getting Better. Though I already knew that war was in decline, especially wars between nation states, the book documented how every other measure of human wellbeing had increased over the decades: longevity, child mortality, infectious disease, malnutrition, democracy, literacy, basic education, and yes, extreme poverty. And it noted that the World Bank and the UN Sustainable Development goals had set the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030 as a feasible, albeit extraordinarily difficult, aspiration. This lifted my view of history and the current state of the world to a higher level. The decline of violence was just one aspect of a historical process that we can legitimately call “progress” – not a romantic or utopian or naive ideal, but an empirical fact that we can see in graphs and numbers. It led me to ask what made this seemingly mystical process happen, and inspired me to write Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress. Steven Pinker is Johnstone professor of psychology at Harvard University and the author, most recently, of Rationality: What It Is, Why It Seems Scarce, Why It Matters (Allen Lane) Mary Beard When I was starting to write my PhD thesis, it was Mary Douglas’s Purity and Danger that opened my eyes, and helped me see different things not just in Roman history but in the world around me too. Its basic idea was to ask: “What counts as dirty (or polluted) in different cultures?” (Why is gravy on your tie “dirty” but on your potatoes not?) A large part of her answer to that was “ambiguity”: “dirty things” are often those that “fall between established categories”. And her key example was not gravy, but Jewish dietary rules, which she argued were based on precisely that kind of ambiguity (pigs, for example, are prohibited or polluted because they are animals with cloven hoofs but they do not, as most cloven hoofed animals do, chew the cud). She later questioned that idea herself and it’s probably wrong. But it had already set me off on a new track. I had never before thought of asking that kind of question about the Romans. What did they think was dirty? And how different were they from us? I am not sure that the answers I came up with were any more correct than those of Douglas herself. But her book showed me how to ask different questions – and it showed that a book doesn’t have to be right to be important. Mary Beard is a classicist and author of books including SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome (Profile) and Twelve Caesars: Images of Power from the Ancient World to the Modern (Princeton). Margo Jefferson It was 1966 or 67 when I first read Ralph Ellison’s essay collection Shadow and Act. Those were fierce, tumultuous years and I was avidly reading Black literature across generations and genres: Richard Wright, James Baldwin, Paule Marshall, Gwendolyn Brooks, Amiri Baraka; poets from the Harlem renaissance to the Black Arts Movement. I’d been floored by the greatness of Ellison’s Invisible Man. But these essays showed another Ellison, a scrupulous explorer of America’s cultural landscape, finding new paths through the fraught territory of American history and art. Racial bigotries enhanced by intellectual fallacies. The ethos and aesthetics of jazz; the ethos and aesthetics of literature and folklore. He probed the ways – stark and subtle - in which Black and white traditions engage and intermingle with each other, how they clash and cohabit. He parsed the relations between group and personal identity. He probed large themes and ideas, “the enigmas, the contradictions of character and culture”. And he never stopped pursuing “inflection, intonation, timbre and phrasings … all those nuances of expression and attitude which reveal a culture”. His precision was scrupulous and expressive. It won me over. And because it sharpened my mind, it gave me room to disagree with him. He made me want to be a more independent thinker. Reading him, I realised that even great novelists (and poets) needed to write criticism, that criticism lets them delineate and transmit passion, character and history in ways that fiction did not. For me this change of hierarchies was a change of mind and a change of heart. Margo Jefferson is a Pulitzer prize-winning cultural critic and the author of books including Negroland (Pantheon) and Constructing a Nervous System (Granta). Marcus du Sautoy The planet is facing a climate emergency. We need to reduce carbon emissions. But what can I personally do to help? I often feel overwhelmed by the complexity of the issues. It was reading Sarah Bridle’s book Food and Climate Change Without the Hot Air that helped me understand a very important way that I really could contribute. Change my diet. As Bridle explains, this is the easiest way to help save the planet. Bridle’s book is a follow up to David MacKay’s equally wonderful book Sustainable Energy – Without the Hot Air. MacKay’s mantra is “numbers not adjectives”. I’m a numbers guy. I need things translated into numbers before I can make a decision about the best course of action. This is precisely the thesis of both books. It allows the reader to see and compare the impact of a change of behaviour. To see the effect through numbers that the production of meat and meat-related products has on the environment was a revelation. A quarter of the greenhouse-gas emissions that cause climate change comes from food. Just giving up food from cows could have a massive impact. Bridle’s book changed how I eat. I am an aspiring vegan, which means I still can’t resist cheese. But perhaps I don’t need to be perfect. It just takes millions doing their bit imperfectly. More people reading this book might help. Marcus du Sautoy is the Simonyi professor for the public understanding of science at the University of Oxford and author of Thinking Better: The Art of the Shortcut (4th Estate) Rebecca Solnit The language of politics can shut down or open up possibilities, as I was reminded when I recently reread one of Doris Lessing’s novels about her time in the Communist party in which party members speak to each other in stale and abstracted terms that obfuscate, distort and most of all bore. The lingering impact of this kind of political language is part of why the Zapatistas’ sudden appearance on the world stage, with their uprising on 1 January 1994, and the battles they fought with language, were so astonishing and exciting for me and to many others. “Thousands of indigenous, armed with truth and fire, with shame and dignity, shook the country awake from its sweet dream of modernity,” Subcomandante Insurgente Marcos wrote shortly thereafter, in a piece titled The Long Journey from Despair to Hope, which is collected in Our Word Is Our Weapon: Selected Writings, a gorgeous English-language compilation edited by Juana Ponce de León and published in 2001. I have drawn inspiration from it ever since. Marcos was a non-Indigenous Mexican leftist who had gone to Chiapas to lead the Indigenous communities in revolution, only to find that it was they who were to lead him, in reconceiving what revolution was and its goals could be. There was hope, ferocity and brilliance in his words for the next dozen years or so, but also playfulness, humor, vivid imagery, emotional immediacy and metaphors drawn from the natural world. Poetry and politics are often treated as entirely separate matters; part of Marcos’s genius was to see that there was no great politic without poetry. Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist. Her most recent books are Recollections of My Nonexistence and Orwell’s Roses (Granta). Jim Al-Khalili As a scientist I have spent most of my life wading through dry academic textbooks. But I also have a passion for popular science. Often such books will be on subjects I just wish to know more about, but I also have to read outside my expertise as preparation for interviewing a guest on The Life Scientific on Radio 4. However, I cannot think of any book that has had a bigger impact on my thinking than Consciousness Explained by the American philosopher Daniel Dennett. In this popular account of the origins of consciousness, Dennett offers an explanation of how it arises from interactions between the physical and cognitive processes in the brain. He writes in an extremely persuasive way and without recourse to any woo or pseudoscientific mysticism. I remember feeling that, for the first time, I might be able to understand what it means to be conscious and self-aware from a reductionist, scientific perspective. This was about 30 years ago, and I know the science of consciousness studies has moved on since then. A number of critics of the book – both philosophers and neuroscientists – have argued that Dennett is denying the existence of subjective conscious states, while giving the appearance of a scientific explanation of them. But for me, at the time, it was a book that explained away one of the deepest mysteries of existence using logic and common sense. Whether right or wrong, it altered my entire worldview on the comprehensibility of reality. Until I read this book my view was that the nature of consciousness was such an intractable problem that it wasn’t something we were anywhere near being able make sense of. While Dennett’s approach is not likely to be whole story – after all, the human brain is the most complex system in the known universe – it nevertheless blew me away that it was at least conceivable in principle to rationalise it. Jim Al-Khalili is the University of Surrey’s distinguished chair in theoretical physics, a broadcaster and author of books including The World According to Physics and The Joy of Science (Princeton). Gaia Vince No Logo by Naomi Klein didn’t just change my mind, it hurled it into a different orbit, giving me an entirely new perspective on how the globalised world works. It emerged, a firebrand, straight into the turn-of-the-century’s defining social movement, coming out in November 1999 during mass protests against the World Trade Organization, the so-called Battle of Seattle. I was in my 20s, navigating a landscape dominated by big brands, with opaque practices and unquestioned ubiquity in an increasingly deregulated neoliberal economy. Rampant consumerism, Klein revealed, was a deliberate global movement, driven by large multinational corporations with disturbing political power, perpetuating poverty, global injustice, environmental degradation and resource depletion. However, we little people also have extraordinary power: activists can take down Goliath brands, she showed through detailed, extraordinary reportage from the frontlines of a burgeoning “global justice” movement. The book is smart, wry, perceptive and absolutely of its time – its effect was electrifying. In that pre-smartphone era when more people read books, No Logo was everywhere. Ironically, the book itself became a brand, an accessory to carry on dates, signifying that its possessor was socially conscious and eco aware. It was one of a handful of important books that spurred a mental transition from seeing myself as an inhabitant of a fully formed world, to understanding that I was an interactive participant in a world that is constantly being created. Gaia Vince is an author, journalist and broadcaster and an honorary senior research fellow at UCL’s Anthropocene Institute. Her latest book is Nomad Century: How to Survive the Climate Upheaval (Allen Lane). Samanth Subramanian Soon after I read “Surely You’re Joking, Mr Feynman!”, my interest in a career in the sciences died. This was not Richard Feynman’s fault. I was, at the time, immersed in a typical Indian high-school curriculum of physics, chemistry and mathematics: dense lessons that urged rote memorisation or brute practice. You solved problems for homework with the sole purpose of solving them in examinations. There was no better way to fall out of love with physics. In those years, any interest that I retained in the subject was thanks to Feynman’s patchwork memoir. It is not, I should mention right away, a flawless book; Feynman is forever burnishing his eccentric genius, and his self-perceived rakishness borders on misogyny. But his inquisitiveness and his joy in pure thought shine through, and they captivated me at a time when my teachers were scrubbing all the charm out of science. Here’s an example. Feynman was never short of big, important problems to work on, but he was equally absorbed by small, seemingly inconsequential questions. Once, while at Princeton University, he watched an S-shaped water sprinkler turn on a pivot and wondered: Would the sprinkler turn clockwise or counter-clockwise if it was set up to take water in instead of spit it out? He could argue it either way, he found, so he prepared an experiment in the cyclotron to find out. It proved nothing, and a glass carboy exploded in the process. Feynman mentions the incident fleetingly, but there are so many more like it: little excursions of curiosity, reminders that science is, above all, lit by the pure delight of human inquiry.

2022-02-23T07:01:31Z,"Increase funding or abandon hope of ending malaria, TB and Aids, UK warned",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/23/increase-funding-or-abandon-hope-of-ending-malaria-tb-and-aids-uk-warned,"Britain is being urged to pledge billions of dollars to get the fight against malaria, tuberculosis and Aids “back on track” after efforts were ravaged by the Covid-19 pandemic. The UK has historically been one of the main donors to the Global Fund, an international financing organisation aimed at ending the three deadly epidemics by 2030. Now it is warning that, unless donors make an unprecedented total funding pledge of $18bn (£13.25bn) this year, that goal will be missed. “In the face of the catastrophic impact of Covid-19 on the fight against HIV, TB and malaria, the choice is stark: we either increase funding, or we abandon hope of finally defeating these epidemics by 2030,” said Peter Sands, executive director of the Global Fund. In a statement seen by the Guardian, a group of African politicians echoed that warning, stressing that the world faces “a critical moment”. “Covid-19 devastated health systems and crippled the global response to health challenges … What follows now will be decisive in getting progress back on track,” write the seven parliamentarians from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Rwanda and Senegal. “Key donor countries who have played an important role in this historic partnership, such as the US, UK and others, once again have the opportunity to demonstrate leadership with strong funding pledges, which will be met by implementing countries upholding commitments to mobilise their own resources.” Campaigners said the UK government’s decision to cut the aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% of gross national income has already had an impact on global efforts against HIV, Aids, TB and malaria, contributing to a wider stalling of progress during the pandemic. Doubt was cast on Britain’s likely commitment to the Global Fund on Tuesday when the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said, in a written statement, she was “rebalancing the aid budget towards bilateral programmes” and, implicitly, away from multilateral organisations. The Global Fund said the record target of $18bn was needed because “significant progress” in tackling the three diseases had been lost. “Hard-won gains against HIV, TB and malaria are being reversed, with devastating consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable communities,” it said. “The entire United Nations sustainable development goals agenda is now at risk, as inequities deepen, poverty spirals and social and political tensions grow.” If the target was reached, it said, it would enable the fund to save 20 million lives between 2024 and 2026, and reduce the death toll across the three diseases to 950,000 in 2026, down from 2.4 million in 2020, and from 4 million in 2005. Mike Podmore, director of StopAids, welcomed the African MPs’ call. “These parliamentarians are right to speak out,” he said. “The UK has played a leading role in the global response to date, but in order to avoid losing the substantial progress made against Aids, tuberculosis and malaria, the UK must deliver a strong funding pledge at this year’s replenishment, and maintain its position as the second biggest donor to the Global Fund.” With deaths from TB increasing to 1.5 million in 2020, Aaron Oxley, executive director of non-profit Results UK, said commitment was needed “now more than ever”. “It is essential that the UK government listen to their counterparts in countries who are implementing programmes in partnership with the Global Fund and make an ambitious pledge at the upcoming seventh replenishment.” Gareth Jenkins, director of advocacy at Malaria No More UK, said it was “vital that the UK continues to make a leading down payment on the health security of the world”. According to the World Health Organization, 627,000 people died of malaria in 2020, an increase of 12% on the year before. Most – 96% – were in sub-Saharan Africa. Set up in 2002, the Global Fund raises and spends funds during three-year “replenishment” periods, the seventh of which begins in 2024. The sixth replenishment meeting in 2019 in Lyon, hosted by President Emmanuel Macron, raised $14.02bn, the largest amount ever for a multilateral health organisation. The seventh replenishment meeting will be in the US later this year hosted, by President Joe Biden. A spokesperson for the foreign, commonwealth and development office said: “As one of its largest donors, UK aid to the Global Fund is actively fighting malaria, Aids and tuberculosis around the world. We continue to support the Fund’s vital work.”","Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria; Health; Global health; Global development; Aids and HIV; Tuberculosis; Malaria; Society; World news; Foreign policy; Liz Truss; Aid",Global development
2022-05-01T11:14:36Z,Governments need data about us despite privacy fears | Larry Elliott,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/01/policy-makers-need-data-about-us-despite-privacy-fears,"Next slide please. We soon caught on to the way it worked. Chris Whitty would give the word and up would pop a chart detailing the progress being made in the fight against Covid-19. There are memes and mugs to commemorate the catchphrase of England’s chief medical officer. Whitty’s presentations detailed infection rates, hospitalisations and deaths. Within weeks of the pandemic’s arrival in early 2020 the public knew about the R number – a way of assessing how fast the virus was spreading. Over the months, public concern about Covid-19 has faded and it is now well behind inflation in the list of concerns troubling voters. Rising prices have meant increased scrutiny of the way Britain calculates the cost of living, including from the chef and activist Jack Monroe. The Office for National Statistics calculates the annual inflation rate by collecting the price of 700 goods and services at various locations and online, but says it wants to know more about price movements and how spending habits are changing. Almost certainly, the next big economic debate will be about whether or not the UK is heading for recession. In 2008, output had already been falling for several months before it was reflected in the quarterly figures for gross domestic product. Since then, there has been the introduction of monthly GDP figures and since the pandemic the use of experimental figures designed to provide real-time indicators on the state of the economy. These include card payments, the number of people eating out and traffic density. The common thread that links these three examples is data. Governments have always seen the link between data and policy decisions. William I’s Domesday Book was an early stab at a national audit for 11th-century England. In 1801 concern about whether there would be enough food for a growing population prompted the first census covering England, Scotland and Wales. Over time, the state has found out more and more about how its citizens live, to the point where there is a legitimate debate to be had about invasion of privacy. It is not just governments, however. Use of loyalty cards gives retailers information about our spending habits. Tech companies such as Facebook and Google know what every user is interested in and tailor the ads that pop up accordingly. Getting the balance right is not easy. Ministers needed accurate data to monitor the impact of the lockdown on infection rates. The Bank of England needs enough information to be able to calibrate the right level of interest rates. Life has moved on from the early 1930s when the lack of accurate and comprehensive data hindered the response to the Great Depression in the US. But not everywhere. In some parts of the world, investment in data collection and analysis is abysmally low. Four in 10 of the world’s deaths are unregistered. More than a quarter of children overall and more than half of children in sub-Saharan Africa under the age of five were not registered at birth. A Google search for the world’s population brings up the number 7.9 billion but that’s really just an educated guess. The same applies to human development indicators such as infant mortality or literacy rates. There’s more. Only one in six countries have sufficient data to report on progress towards hitting climate change targets and on average the latest emissions data is from 2015. Two-thirds of countries have been forced to postpone a planned census due to the pandemic. The UN has a set of sustainable development goals to be hit by 2030: in only six of the 17 have more than two-thirds of countries data to report. A paper published jointly by the UN, the World Bank and the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (a network of more than 600 partners from tech giants to civil society groups) says the issues are most pressing where the challenges are greatest. Gaps in the data are glaring for gender in all areas of development: economic opportunities, environment, health, human security and public participation. Clearly, technology has a role to play in plugging these gaps and in some cases is already doing so. Ghana, for example, set up a partnership between its national statistics office, Vodafone Ghana and the Swedish nonprofit foundation Flowminder to track mobility and help in public health emergency planning. Two other ingredients are needed. The first is money, because after a 10-year period in which aid for data systems has flatlined there is now a financing gap of more than $1bn (£800m). For donor countries, spending money on statisticians is simply not as glamorous as spending money on a new hospital, even though better data would lead to better health care. The World Bank and the UN launched a campaign last week to raise at least $500m over the next 10 years, which they believe could act as the catalyst for billions of dollars of overseas development assistance and private sector funding. The second ingredient is governance, where there is a need to ensure low-income countries are not stripped of data in the way they have too often been stripped of their natural resources. A long history of exploitation means care must be given to ensure potential benefits from improved data is shared fairly. Facebook is expanding in Africa and so is Huawei: safeguards are needed to ensure this investment serves the public good. Even so, the message is clear. If the world is serious about tackling climate change, it needs better data. If it wants to have better defences against future pandemics it needs better data. If it wants faster growth in poorer countries it needs better data. Making decisions in the dark is not sensible.

2021-11-18T16:00:09Z,No country has met welfare goals in past 30 years ‘without putting planet at risk’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/18/no-country-has-met-welfare-goals-in-past-30-years-without-putting-planet-at-risk,"No country has managed to meet the basic social needs of its population in the past 30 years without putting undue pressure on the Earth’s supply of natural resources, according to a study. Looking at a sample of 148 nations, research by the University of Leeds found wealthy countries were putting the future of the planet at risk to make minimal gains in human welfare, while poor countries were living within ecological boundaries but underachieving in areas such as life expectancy and access to energy. The report, which follows the conclusion of the Cop26 climate change talks in Glasgow, said that on current trends the next 30 years would see the pattern repeated and called for a rethink of growth-dominated economic models. Its authors said the research was the first attempt to track nation-by-nation progress in achieving environmental and social goals, and that even wealthy countries seen as having good sustainability records – such as Germany and Norway – were using more than their fair share of the world’s resources. The report, which was published in the journal Nature Sustainability, said wealthy countries, including the US, the UK and Canada were achieving minimal social gains despite using resources at a level that was consistent with climate and ecological breakdown. Poorer countries such as Bangladesh, Malawi and Sri Lanka were living within planetary boundaries, but still falling short on meeting many basic human needs. Researchers tracked country performance on 11 social priorities broadly aligned with the 2030 United Nations sustainable development goals. The indicators included life expectancy, nutrition, sanitation and access to education. The study also assessed whether countries were operating within six planetary boundaries, including global heating, excessive fertiliser use and land-system change. Dr Andrew Fanning, the report’s lead author, said: “Everyone needs a sufficient level of resources to be healthy and to participate in their society with dignity, but we also need to ensure global resource use is not so high that we cause climate and ecological breakdown. “We examined country trajectories since the early 1990s and found that most countries are closer to providing basic needs for their residents than they were 30 years ago, which is good news, although important shortfalls remain, especially for collective goals such as equality and democratic quality. “The bad news is that the number of countries that are over-consuming resources is increasing, especially for carbon dioxide emissions and material use. “Worryingly, we found that countries tend to overshoot fair shares of planetary boundaries faster than they achieve minimum social thresholds.”",Climate crisis; Environment; Business; UK news; World news; Sustainable development,Environment
2021-12-29T11:36:27Z,Gordon Brown: west is sleepwalking into Afghanistan disaster,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/29/gordon-brown-west-sleepwalking-afghanistan-disaster,"The west is “sleepwalking into the biggest humanitarian crisis of our times” in Afghanistan, Gordon Brown has warned, as he called for a support package to save the country from economic and social collapse after the Taliban’s takeover. Four months after the western-backed government was overthrown following a mass military withdrawal, the former UK prime minister said the case for action was not based only on morals but also “in our self-interest”. He said more than half the Afghan population was facing extreme hunger, including 1 million children at risk of starving to death, citing International Monetary Fund predictions that the country’s economy would contract by 20-30% in the next year. “No country in recent times is suffering from such ‘universal poverty’ in the way that Afghanistan may do,” Brown wrote in an article for the Times. “It is ironic that when the whole international community is pledged to achieve the sustainable development goals – to free all the world from absolute poverty this decade – almost every citizen of Afghanistan will be condemned to that dire fate. “Instead of no absolute poverty in any country, we will have the horror of practically an entire country living in absolute poverty.” Brown stressed the effects may be felt within Europe, given thousands of Afghans would be faced with the choice of starving or emigrating. About $4.5bn (£3.3bn) should be pledged by countries to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Brown urged, adding that the “largest humanitarian response ever agreed for a single nation” was required. He continued: “It cost America trillions to fight the war in Afghanistan. It is not beyond our capacity to find $4bn to prevent starvation amid this uneasy peace. “This tragedy foretold cannot be a tragedy unresolved.” Brown also said the frantic military retreat from Afghanistan, when tens of thousands of people tried to flee on evacuation flights before the last troops pulled out, signalled the end of the notion allies could “impose liberal western values overnight” in other countries. However, speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he cautioned: “What it cannot do is remove the obligation on each of us to understand that we are in an integrated and interconnected world where we are all affected by decisions that are made in other countries and we have got to do something to help those, particularly those who face starvation. “Otherwise, not just for moral reasons but for self-interested reasons, this will come back to haunt us.” According to the Disasters Emergency Committee, 8 million people are on the brink of famine in Afghanistan, while 95% of the entire population does not have enough to eat. The situation has been compounded by the Covid pandemic and the worst drought in 27 years – and is expected to get worse through the winter as temperatures drop. Prince Charles, who is a patron of the International Rescue Committee UK, recently urged people to donate to its fundraiser, calling the situation in Afghanistan “truly catastrophic”. Damning new light was shed on the UK’s handling of its withdrawal from Afghanistan earlier this month, when a Foreign Office whistleblower who helped sort requests for evacuation revealed the chaos and confusion at the heart of the operation. He said the government falsely claimed each request was logged, prioritisations were made with little consistency or checks and there was a lack of staff, experience and equipment.",Afghanistan; Gordon Brown; Foreign policy; Taliban; Aid; Politics; Poverty; South and central Asia; UK news; World news,World news
2021-11-17T17:01:22Z,‘Critical lifeline’ of migrant cash expected to near £600bn in total,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/nov/17/critical-lifeline-of-migrant-cash-expected-to-near-600bn-in-total,"Migrants from low- and middle-income countries are expected to send almost £600bn to support friends and relatives by the end of the year, after global economic growth spurred a 7.3% rebound in remittance payments. The increase in cross-border payments, especially from migrants based in Europe and the US, reversed a 1.7% fall in remittance payments last year, the World Bank said. Eighteen months ago the bank, based in Washington DC, feared that the pandemic would send remittance payments plunging by about 20% over the next two years. However, the rapid recovery during 2020 and 2021 meant the scale of payments to these countries from former residents working overseas surpassed the sum of overseas aid and foreign direct investment from richer nations. The World Bank said its annual survey of foreign exchange transactions, excluding those for China, showed remittances would grow to $589bn in 2021. “This underscores the importance of remittances in providing a critical lifeline by supporting household spending on essential items such as food, health and education during periods of economic hardship in migrants’ countries of origin,” it said. Latin American and Caribbean countries were the biggest beneficiaries of remittances, mostly from family members based in the US. Flows to these regions increased by 21% over the last year. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa were among the least supported by former residents, which the World Bank partly blamed on high transaction charges. The cost of sending $200 across international borders averaged 6.4% of the amount transferred, in the first quarter of 2021, the development bank said. This was more than double the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals target of 3%, but below the 8% it costs to send the benchmark sum to sub-Saharan Africa. “Costs tend to be higher when remittances are sent through banks rather than through digital channels or through money transmitters offering cash-to-cash services,” the World Bank said. Michal Rutkowski, the World Bank’s global director for social protection and jobs, said: “Remittance flows from migrants have greatly complemented government cash transfer [programmes] to support families suffering economic hardships during the Covid-19 crisis. “Facilitating the flow of remittances to provide relief to strained household budgets should be a key component of government policies to support a global recovery from the pandemic.” The report found that the strong growth in remittances was due to “migrants’ determination to support their families in times of need, aided by economic recovery in Europe and the US, which in turn was supported by the fiscal stimulus and employment support [programmes]”. Remittances are projected to grow by 2.6% in 2022, in line with the World Bank’s forecasts for a gentle expansion of the global economy that year.",Remittances; World Bank; Global economy; Global development; Business; Migration; Migration and development; World news,Global development
2022-09-19T15:20:51Z,Es Devlin: ‘Has everything I’ve made been worth the resources? Probably not’,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/sep/19/es-devlins-shrine-to-endangered-species-its-a-celebration-of-londoners-who-arent-human,"‘Did you know,” asks Es Devlin, “that you can tell the difference between a wood pigeon and a collared dove from how it emphasises the syllables in its call?” She is sitting at a long table in her home and studio in south London, where big glass doors open on to a leafy garden, as the cooing of a wood pigeon drifts in on the breeze. A nearby table is piled high with pencil drawings of birds, beetles, butterflies and bats, while further illustrations of animals are propped against the walls. It looks like the result of a particularly busy day in an RSPB classroom rather than the lair of a world-famous stage designer. “I’ve been drawing these nonstop for four months,” she says, with an air of exhaustion. “Sometimes for 18 hours a day. I haven’t been out. It’s literally all I’ve been doing.” When the pandemic hit, and Devlin’s busy schedule of designing spectacular stadium shows was suddenly suspended, her mind turned to the wildlife in her own back yard. She had been working on elaborate stage designs for Beyoncé, Adele, and Cirque du Soleil, but suddenly found her world compressed to counting caterpillars and spotting bee hawk moths with her two children. “Do you know about the streaked bombardier beetle?” she asks excitedly. “They thought it was extinct, but then 85 of them were found in Tower Hamlets.” The result of this frenzied bout of drawing, and the reason for our meeting, is the imminent opening of one of Devlin’s most prominent and personal projects yet. Outside Tate Modern, opposite St Paul’s cathedral on the banks of the Thames, she will soon unveil an installation designed to call attention to London’s endangered species, a gleaming shrine to soprano pipistrelles, tall fescue planthoppers and bearded tits. Her sketches of these, and a host of other fish, frogs and fungi, have been enlarged, printed on plywood, and fixed to an illuminated steel and fabric dome, modelled on St Paul’s, inside which choirs from London’s diaspora will perform at sunset for 10 nights. Her renderings give it the look of an animal-themed wedding chapel, the singers surrounded by a frilly veil of her drawings of the 243 species on the capital’s priority list. During the day, visitors will be able to hear recordings of the creatures’ calls, along with intriguing facts read out by Devlin. Did you know that the swift travels the equivalent distance to the moon and back eight times in its life? “I wanted to get people engaged with these animals emotionally,” she says. “I was inspired by the tradition of evensong – to try to achieve that same level of synaesthetic power, with light, music, texts and architecture, in celebration of Londoners who aren’t human. I’m hoping that people who don’t like moths will think again, or people who eat animals might change their minds.” Commissioned by luxury jewellery house Cartier rather than the Tate, the project marks Devlin’s latest foray into the world of brand-sponsored immersive art, continuing her voyage beyond the fourth wall of the stage. She is now represented by Pace gallery, with a permanent installation in Miami and a bendy bamboo history of the world show at London’s Pitzhanger Manor under her belt. So is she staking a claim as an artist? “I think ‘multihyphenate’ is the safest way to put it,” she says, citing the late designer Virgil Abloh’s varied oeuvre as an inspiration. “It might be contemporary art, it might be a sneaker design, it might be, you know, a project for social change. But I think where all my work converges is around shifting people’s perspectives.” Over the last two decades, Devlin has risen to be the most sought-after production designer in the business, revered for conjuring beguiling theatre sets and high-octane stadium shows, subject of a Netflix documentary and a BBC Masterclass. Her designs bring a thrilling, filmic dynamism to the stage – from suspending a rotating floor of a glass office tower above a New York skyline for Sam Mendes’ Lehman Trilogy (which bagged her a Tony award) to memorably burying Hamlet’s castle under a gigantic slag heap for Benedict Cumberbatch’s 2015 take on the Dane. Her concert designs are equally arresting, whether perching Kanye atop an artificial mountain, floating a futuristic star destroyer above the Weeknd, or having Miley Cyrus slide down a giant model of her own tongue. As her Tate installation opens, it is also possible to see her sets for Don Giovanni and Salome at the Royal Opera House, along with a new production of The Crucible at the National Theatre, not to mention two tours for the Weeknd and Florence + the Machine. In recent years, however, Devlin has been pursuing work that isn’t based on someone else’s text or the whims of a pop superstar – to the extent, she says, that two-thirds of her studio output is now her own self-initiated art projects. The shift began in 2016, when she created a mirrored maze in a warehouse in Peckham, in partnership with Chanel, after which a series of commissions for immersive Instagram-friendly brand experiences followed. She built a warped oval model of Manhattan that rotated over a pool of water to promote a New York apartment complex by Bjarke Ingels. Then came a zoetrope-like pavilion in Cape Town for Mercedes-Benz, to showcase its electric car technology. For the 2018 London design festival she installed a bright red lion in Trafalgar Square that spouted AI-generated poetry, a theme she further explored at the UK pavilion at the 2021 Dubai Expo. A pile of planks arranged like a cone on its side, the pavilion generated an AI poem every 90 seconds, using words contributed by visitors that appeared at the end of each piece of wood. Examples included such gnomic lines as “Now I’m in a garden by chance, and the light is all but positivity” and “Papa’s shirt, and the grasshopper coming this way – but this is a weird day for thinking”. It didn’t receive the kind of rave reviews Devlin was used to. “I have never seen such a waste of public money,” declared Stuart Rose, former boss of Marks &amp; Spencer, after visiting the £44m project with business leaders. “A giant ice-cream cone spouting gobbledegook,” is how someone else described it. Devlin is sanguine. “Some of it was profound,” she says. “Some of it was nonsense. I thought it was a pretty good expression of our country.” More recently, her use of trees in temporary installations has raised environmental eyebrows, attracting similar accusations of greenwashing as the Marble Arch Mound and Thomas Heatherwick’s jubilee tree-rack. Devlin trucked 400 saplings to the courtyard of Somerset House last year to promote the UN’s sustainable development goals, and imported another forest to Glasgow to create a silvan backdrop for the New York Times Climate Hub at Cop26 a few months later. Devlin says her arboreal interest was triggered by reading The Overstory by Richard Powers, a multigenerational saga told from the perspective of trees, and she does not seem to have any regrets: “For Cop26, I thought, ‘Wouldn’t it be interesting if the protagonists in that room were not humans, but trees, and you had 197 of them, each bearing witness to what 197 countries might do? It is neuroscientifically proven that you have better conversations among trees – the Japanese even prescribe ‘forest bathing’ – and I think the climate discussions bore that out.” Her conversation is sprinkled with such environmental nuggets, gleaned from voracious reading, which often provide the starting point for her work. She cites James Gleick, author of Chaos, and the CIA systems theorist turned Buddhist scholar, Joanna Macy, alongside Serpentine curator Hans Ulrich Obrist who, she says, “has helped to shape my thesis”. Her Miami installation, for the Superblue gallery, takes the form of another mirrored maze, this time inspired by “the symmetry between the systems in your lungs, which bifurcate with exactly the same frequency as trees”. The theme recurred in a collaboration with Pangaia, for a clothing line launched as a “reminder to take action now” on climate change, each garment printed with a quote from Devlin: “A forest of us, a symbiotic symmetry, a branching geometry that flows within us and around us but do you see it, can you feel it, do you breathe it can you find it – go and find it.” Such environmental platitudes can sometimes feel at odds with the resource-intensive reality of her work. For a recent fashion show for Yves Saint Laurent in the Moroccan desert, Devlin dug a big circular pond and bathed the surrounding sand dunes in clouds of artificial mist – just as Morocco was suffering the worst drought in 40 years (YSL says that non-drinking water was used in the pond, and it was recycled for irrigation). Also, as a producer of touring rock concerts, her hefty sets are regularly trucked across continents and flown around the planet, emitting countless tonnes of CO2. “It’s the most important bit of work we still have to do,” she says. “We need to think more about modular systems, about each venue having its own kit of parts, rather than starting from scratch each time.” Aware of her own carbon footprint, Devlin has embarked on a programme of offsetting, contributing to a reforestation project in Brazil and building a school classroom in Malawi with charity AquAid. The designer, about to turn 51, is taking stock. “I’m halfway through my life and I’ve learned a lot,” she says. “But, in the rest of the days that I’ve got, I want to make work that is really worth the resources put into it. Has everything I’ve ever made been worth the resources? Probably not.” She says her latest interest is in finding new uses for redundant department stores, inspired by what she calls the “180-fication” of London, referring to 180 The Strand, a postwar office block that has been reborn as a gallery and events space. “I lie awake thinking about Debenhams,” she says with a chuckle. “Imagine cameras going up and down that shaft where the escalators used to be, and how you could place stages or artworks on different levels within it. Injecting music and theatre into the high street, wouldn’t that be gorgeous?” Come Home Again is at the Tate Modern garden from 21 September until 1 October. Choral evensong is at sunsets from 22-25 September.",Art and design; Culture; Design; Tate Modern; Art; London; Wildlife; Environment; UK news; Theatre; Stage; Es Devlin,Art and design
2022-09-21T05:00:20Z,‘There’s a path towards death that people travel’: how hunger destroys lives and communities,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/sep/21/theres-a-path-towards-death-that-people-travel-how-hunger-destroys-lives-and-communities,"The human body is smart, says Dr Christopher Mambula, medical manager for east Africa at Médecins Sans Frontières. He’s talking about the physical effects of food deprivation, a subject that gets little attention even within the medical world, and yet, as aid agencies continue to report, affects hundreds of millions of people around the world. “If it doesn’t have enough food to convert into energy,” he continues, “it will burn through its own fat reserves, breaking down fat cells into fatty acids to be used for energy or converted into glucose by the liver.” How long it takes for the body to use up all its fat deposits depends on multiple factors: the amount and nutritional value of food being eaten; the individual’s metabolism; their activity levels; their body mass index; and their age and overall health. “It could take a month, six months, a year. People don’t go from some food to zero food. They start to reduce the number of meals. In places like the Horn of Africa people may go entire days without a meal,” Mambula says. After a sustained period of severe lack of food, the only fat left in the body will be between muscles, in joints and organ cells. “In women, in the worst-case scenario, you will notice they have no more breast tissue because every single ounce of fat is converted in places that are usually spared,” Mambula says. While this is happening, low glucose levels in the blood make the person feel weak and dizzy. It is at this point – feeling woozy, irritable and struggling to concentrate – that many people are forced to make difficult decisions. If they cannot find water for their cattle, do they sell it at a vastly lower price than its original worth? Do they take their daughters out of school? Do they split up the family? Using up the body’s fat reserves is not dangerous in itself, but if food deprivation continues once the fat is gone, the body will start to break down muscle cells to access the fatty acids and proteins contained within them. The result of this is muscle atrophy – the medical term for loss of muscle mass – as the muscle cells lose their structural integrity. Within a few weeks, there’s no longer enough muscle to support the body, even in a seated position. Lying down is the only option. As muscle cells break down they release chemicals, including potassium, chloride and sodium, and cellular debris into the bloodstream. These chemicals, combined with a lack of vital minerals and vitamins from malnutrition, cause an imbalance that affects multiple parts of the body, from individual cells to organ function. Lack of zinc can cause diarrhoea and cracked skin, and reduces the ability to fight infections. Salt imbalance may be associated with oedema or swelling, which can also lead to kwashiorkor, or severe malnutrition in young children, causing swollen bellies and faces. Dr Neal Russell, a paediatric adviser with MSF, says: “There is a path towards death that people travel. Until they are at a late stage, deficiencies can be corrected by giving food, but beyond a certain point the body cannot regulate itself, even with treatment.” The last thing to stop is the heart – in some cases, because the weakened heart is simply not powerful enough to pump blood around the body; in others, chemical imbalance in the bloodstream stops the heart. A person may not be conscious at this point: unable to function without energy, the brain begins to shut down. In the last hours before falling into a coma, a person may lose their vision as the brain zones in and out. Though malnutrition affects millions of people, especially children, there is still much that is unknown about it. “Much of what we thought we knew 20 years ago has since been questioned,” Russell says. Lack of money means there is still a dearth of research into both the short- and long-term impacts of malnutrition. “This is not a subject that people put a lot of medical research into,” he adds. “The money is in obesity and overnutrition, and research follows money. We got Covid vaccines in one year.” What is known is that most people suffering from malnutrition die from disease or infection rather than starvation itself. Lack of food affects the immune system, shrinking the lymph nodes so they produce fewer white blood cells. The existing white blood cells don’t have sufficient energy to do their job in fighting off bacteria or healing a wound. A person is much more vulnerable to diseases such as malaria or conditions such as pneumonia and sepsis. A dystopian crisis “Zero hunger” by 2030 was one of 17 sustainable development goals set out by the UN in 2015. Today, the UN predicts that the number of people affected by hunger will surpass 840 million by 2030. Far from the situation improving, millions are trapped in the worst hunger crisis in living memory. The World Food Programme says 50 million people in 45 countries are teetering on the edge of famine. “A few years ago, things were gradually getting better and now it is going in the other direction, rapidly. It’s extremely worrying when you think about the impact on real people. What shocks me is the lack of outrage – it’s horrifying,” Russell says. In September, the UN warned that famine was likely to be declared in Somalia later this year. A letter to UN member states as they gather for the 2022 UN general assembly this week was the latest call for immediate funding to prevent suffering now and in the future. “In a world of plenty, leaving people to starve is a policy choice,” reads the letter, which is signed by 238 NGOs. “The lack of political will and institutional failure to act quickly before the worst case hits means people are being left to lurch from crisis to crisis. People are not starving; they are being starved.” These are needless deaths that will be largely ignored by a world distracted by extreme weather, the cost of living crisis and political upheavals. Aid agencies have the knowledge and ability to address food insecurity, but not the funding, says Alexandra Rutishauser-Perera, head of nutrition at Action Against Hunger UK. “We know how to [address food insecurity] better and better, but we are not given the means to implement all we know. Aid is not arriving fast enough and is not large enough to improve the situation. For the moment, it’s about trying to reduce the number of lives being lost.” In addition to lack of funding, costs are rising. Over the past year, the cost of ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) that Action Against Hunger gives to malnourished children has increased by 23%, including a 9% increase since the war in Ukraine began. According to Unicef, global prices for RUTF are expected to increase by an additional 16% over the next six months, as the price of transportation and ingredients continues to rise. The war in Ukraine has pushed up the cost of food, energy and fertiliser around the world, and caused supply chains to stall, adding to the existing strain from conflict, extreme weather and economic shocks. Russell describes watching this crisis unfold before his eyes as “dystopian”. He feels a responsibility to communicate what hunger does to people, but struggles to find the right words. “I can go into my safe zone [using medical terminology], but I have never found the language to describe the horror and injustice of seeing a child dying from malnutrition.” In 2021, MSF admitted 82,000 children to intensive therapeutic feeding centres, a 27% rise on 2020. A further 200,000 children were treated for malnutrition outside hospital. It expects numbers to grow again in 2022. “One of the most haunting things about a children’s malnutrition centre is the deadly quiet of some children,” Russell says. “Their childhood has evaporated away. Young children regress, and stop walking or become incontinent – and they stop doing normal things like playing.” Globally, malnutrition underlies almost half of child deaths in under-fives. The majority will die of infection because their immune systems are battered by lack of nutrients. “Your general defences against infection are reduced, your skin becomes thinner, your gut wall is thinner, the defences in your respiratory tract are weaker [and] less likely to cough things up,” Russell says. Measles, malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea are all common killers among children suffering from malnourishment; in many cases these children are moderately, as opposed to severely, malnourished. “The malnutrition can be just enough to tip the balance in children, causing them to contract an infection that will kill them.” For every 10 children admitted to an intensive therapeutic feeding centre, one will probably die. Research published in the Lancet in May 2022 suggests that for every one that dies in hospital another will die after they are discharged. The first 1,000 days of life are crucial for nutrition. Children who survive can suffer long-lasting effects. Impaired cognitive and physical and behavioural development can affect their education. The condition is also intergenerational – an adolescent girl or young woman who is undernourished may give birth to an undernourished baby. The hidden mental health cost For every child too weak to laugh or play, there is a shellshocked mother and father watching on helplessly. A study published by BMC Pediatrics found the prevalence of moderate to severe depression among mothers of malnourished children was significantly higher (64.1%) compared with mothers of normal weight children (5.1%). But there is little funding to address mental health in areas where hunger kills and tears families apart. “I’ve seen what it does to a family but we are not given enough money for it. The impact of providing water, food, medicine can be measured but it’s really difficult to account for mental health provision to a donor, so it is always the first thing to be cut [if there is not enough funding],” says Rutishauser-Perera. “When you don’t have the money to have psychologists onboard, agencies don’t have the means to identify and measure the extent of the problem, and offer appropriate support,” she adds. In addition to the stress of not being able to provide, the breakdown of relationships between families also depletes a person’s mental reserves. As part of its work, Action Against Hunger helps mothers to bond with their children who survive illness, teaching them to play with children who did not have the energy to interact while they were ill. “Hunger takes something away from you,” Russell says. “You can see how that breaks down a society and leads to more insecurity, conflict and anger.” • This article was amended on 23 September 2022.

2022-03-14T12:30:03Z,The big idea: should other species have their own money?,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/14/the-big-idea-should-other-species-have-their-own-money,"Only about 120,000 orangutans remain in the wild, and despite the whopping $1bn that has been spent on protecting them since 2000, their numbers continue to decline. The orangutan is the most endangered great ape, but the picture is only marginally less grim for the others – except us, of course – and the trend is the same across the living world: we’re witnessing a sixth mass extinction. Given that current conservation efforts aren’t working fast enough, many feel it is time for some out-of-the-box thinking. It doesn’t come much further out than giving other species their own money, but that proposal is now on the table. The first to benefit might be our intelligent, red-haired cousins. “Interspecies money” is the brainchild of British futurist Jonathan Ledgard, who has built a reputation for throwing out imaginative, left-field solutions to the planet’s existential threats. He started with a few key observations. First, biodiversity tends to be high where people are poor. Second, technological advances such as drones, smartphones, genomics and data storage have made it easier and cheaper to track wildlife. And third, new software tools including cryptocurrencies, blockchain and artificial intelligence make it possible to create digital avatars with agency – including spending power – in the real world. If we can do that for humans, he thought, why can’t we do it for nonhumans, allowing them to trade with us for the things that matter to each? It’s an idea that’s a little hard to get your head around, especially if, like me, you’ve observed orangutans learning to count and stumbling over their ones, twos and threes. But in Ledgard’s plan numeracy isn’t required, at least not by the nonhumans. An orangutan would be given its own digital wallet that would be managed by scientists or conservationists on its behalf. The wallet would initially be endowed with the proceeds from sales of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). If NFTs can capture the value of one-off digital artworks, they can presumably do the same for rare species – or related digital entities. This money would be paid out to people living near the animal in exchange for protecting or observing it. As more species were drawn into the scheme, their value having been similarly recognised, a digital currency might emerge – Ledgard dubs it the “life-mark” – overseen by a central “Bank for Other Species”. The idea of interspecies money struck John McArthur as mind-blowing when he first heard about it. The director of the Center for Sustainable Development at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC was already convinced that the UN’s sustainable development goals for 2030 were unlikely to be met without some kind of technological breakthrough, and he thought Ledgard’s plan harnessed one. “Ultimately it’s about digitising the ecosystems of the world in a way that allows us to understand [other species’] preferences, which is interspecies communication,” he says. Brookings included interspecies money in its list of frontier technologies for sustainable development this January. Another fan is Costa Rica-based economist and entrepreneur Ranulfo Paiva Sobrinho, who sees interspecies money as a way of empowering local people. Once they have understood the problem, Sobrinho says, locals often propose better solutions than people far away. Others have been more circumspect. Economist Pavan Sukhdev, former president of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) International, disagrees with Ledgard’s starting premise, which is that markets have failed to price natural capital correctly (this was also the conclusion of the recent, and controversial, Dasgupta review commissioned by the UK government). Markets deal in private assets whereas nature’s resources are a public good that is provided free of charge, he says – and the two don’t mix. “Ledgard’s paper is steeped in the underlying belief system of so-called free market capitalism, which is that markets are the solution to all problems,” Sukhdev says. “That is wrong.” Joshua Farley, an economist at the University of Vermont, agrees: “Rather than trying to internalise nature into the economy, we should focus on internalising our economy into nature.” He gives the example of Brazil’s Atlantic forest, which has been so denuded that many experts now fear it faces catastrophic biodiversity loss. Farley’s group has been exploring how a tax might be levied on carbon or wealth that Brazilians could only pay in an “eco-currency” – the Mata Atlântica Restoration Currency (Marc). Marcs in turn could only be earned through reforestation activities, with the regenerated forest’s extent and hence its value being determined with the aid of geolocation. The advantage of such a scheme is that it gives people an incentive to do the right thing, says Paul Ferraro, professor of human behaviour and public policy at Johns Hopkins University. For at least a decade debate has raged over the relative advantages of utilitarian and non-utilitarian approaches to conservation – or protecting nature in exchange for some personal reward as opposed to doing so because it fulfils a moral obligation. One thing seems clear, Ferraro says: on its own, “doing the right thing is not an effective conservation strategy”. Though the debate rages on, it looks as if the right incentives can complement people’s moral drive to conserve. His worry is that the wrong ones could detract from it, so the choice of incentives is critical. Ferraro is not sure the life-mark is the right incentive. It does not seem to solve the central problem that the costs of conservation are borne individually, while the benefits are enjoyed collectively, he says. But he agrees with McArthur that technology is providing exciting new ways to think about that problem. Building on Ledgard’s plan for orangutans, for example, he wonders if NFTs could be used to pair conservation goals with the acquisition of digital assets. One example might be a scheme just launched by the British-South African nature channel WildEarth TV, where people pay to own digital material relating to individual animals – rather like adopting an animal in the virtual realm. At any rate, a number of economists I spoke to welcomed Ledgard’s contribution to the debate, even if they don’t agree with him. “We should be entertaining all ideas, because we have not solved the problem,” says Ferraro. The problem is only set to get worse, and whether interspecies money is the correct response or not, Ledgard the provocateur has achieved at least one of his aims – by prompting people to search for answers in new places.

2021-07-13T13:28:31Z,"24-hour Covid benefit concert announced with the Weeknd, Billie Eilish and more",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jul/13/24-hour-covid-benefit-concert-global-citizen-live-weeknd-billie-eilish-ed-sheeran-coldplay-bts,"A 24-hour livestreamed concert to benefit global recovery after the Covid-19 pandemic has been announced for 25 September. Music stars including the Weeknd, Ed Sheeran and Billie Eilish are confirmed to perform at Global Citizen Live. Performances will take place across the world, from Central Park in New York to the Champ de Mars in Paris, as well as London, Los Angeles, Lagos, Sydney, Rio de Janeiro and Seoul. The event aims to help to secure a series of pledges from governments and companies, including the donation of a billion doses of Covid vaccine, $6bn (£4.3bn) in famine relief and $400m for education programmes. The French president Emmanuel Macron, German chancellor Angela Merkel, Italian prime minister Mario Draghi and speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi are among politicians supporting the campaign. The event follows Global Citizen’s successful livestreamed concert in 2020, One World: Together at Home, which raised $127m for coronavirus charities from lockdown performances by artists such as Lady Gaga and the Rolling Stones. In May, the advocacy organisation hosted Vax Live: The Concert to Reunite the World at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles with Foo Fighters, Jennifer Lopez, J Balvin and others. Also performing in the impressively starry lineup will be BTS, Coldplay, Shawn Mendes, Lizzo, Andrea Bocelli, Metallica, Lorde, Doja Cat, Keith Urban, Usher, HER, Duran Duran, Femi Kuti, Lang Lang, Demi Lovato, Ricky Martin and others. The BBC has partnered to air the concert, with YouTube, Hulu and other broadcasters and streaming platforms also confirmed. Announcing the event, Global Citizen chief executive Hugh Evans said: “Covid-19 has drastically reversed the progress towards achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, pushing upwards of 160 million people back into extreme poverty. “There are now more than 40 million people on the brink of famine. Progress on climate change has halted, as the majority of the Fortune 500 [companies] fail to set science-based carbon reduction targets. We must rectify the damage done and hold world leaders and businesses accountable for ensuring that the entire world recovers from this pandemic together.”",Music; World news; Culture; Coronavirus; Economic recovery; Vaccines and immunisation; Poverty; Famine; Aid; Health; Society; Coldplay; Ed Sheeran; Billie Eilish; The Weeknd; BTS,Music
2021-04-07T12:00:44Z,IMF calls for wealth tax to help cover cost of Covid pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/apr/07/imf-wealth-tax-cost-covid-pandemic-rich-poor,"Governments should consider levying higher taxes on the income or wealth of the rich to help pay for the enormous cost of tackling the Covid-19 pandemic, the International Monetary Fund has said. Inequality had widened in the year since the virus first hit the global economy, the IMF said, and there was a case for the better off being asked to pay more on a temporary basis to meet crisis-related financial costs. In its half-yearly fiscal monitor report, the IMF called for domestic and international tax changes that would boost the money available to expand public services, make welfare states more generous and meet the UN’s sustainable development goals. “To help meet pandemic-related financing needs, policymakers could consider a temporary Covid-19 recovery contribution, levied on high incomes or wealth,” the fiscal monitor said. “To accumulate the resources needed to improve access to basic services, enhance safety nets, and reinvigorate efforts to achieve the sustainable development goals, domestic and international tax reforms are necessary, especially as the recovery gains momentum.” At a press conference to launch the fiscal monitor, a senior IMF official said there was scope in rich countries to target those individuals and companies that had prospered during the pandemic. Paolo Mauro, the deputy director of the IMF’s fiscal affairs department, said there had been an “erosion” of the taxes paid by those at the top of the income scale, with the pandemic offering a chance to claw some of the money back. “Governments could consider higher taxes on property, capital gains and inheritance,” he said. “One specific option would be a Covid-19 recovery contribution – a surcharge on personal tax or corporate income tax.” Although the pandemic had led to a sharp drop in average incomes, Mauro said some individuals and companies had done “very well” out of the crisis. The IMF said fiscal policy – tax and spending measures – should target support on the poor and vulnerable. It has also publicly backed the call by the US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, for a minimum corporate tax rate to make it more difficult for big multinational corporations to minimise their tax payments. A year marked by the biggest contraction in the global economy in modern times had focused attention on governments and their ability to respond to the crisis, the IMF said. Popular support for better public services, already significant before the pandemic, had probably risen. Urging rich countries to use their resources to speed up the vaccination programmes in poorer nations, the IMF said the upfront costs would be outweighed by the faster growth that would result. The IMF’s world economic outlook – its forecasts for the next two years – contained an upside scenario in which the pandemic was controlled sooner in all countries. This showed stronger economic growth would yield more than $1tn in additional tax revenues in advanced economies, cumulatively, by 2025, and save trillions more in fiscal support measures. “Vaccination will, thus, more than pay for itself, providing excellent value for public money invested in ramping up global vaccine production and distribution,” it said. Vitor Gaspar, the director of the IMF’s fiscal affairs department, said: “Pre-existing inequalities have amplified the adverse impact of the pandemic. And, in turn, Covid-19 has aggravated inequalities. A vicious cycle of inequality could morph into a social and political seismic crack.”",International Monetary Fund (IMF); Business; Global economy; Income inequality; Inequality; Poverty; Coronavirus; Economics; Social exclusion; Society; Tax and spending; World news; Politics; Economic recovery; Economic policy; The super-rich,Business
2022-01-24T08:15:45Z,We can afford to reverse poverty and climate breakdown. What we can’t afford is the alternative | Kevin Watkins,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/24/we-can-afford-to-reverse-poverty-and-climate-breakdown-what-we-cant-afford-is-the-alternative,"“The peoples of the Earth,” Henry Morgenthau said, “are inseparably linked by a deep underlying community of purpose.” In July 1944, Morgenthau, the US Treasury secretary, was closing the Bretton Woods conference with a reflection on extreme nationalism and the failures of cooperation that had led to war. Cautioning against the pursuit of national interest through “the plan-less, senseless rivalry that divided us”, he outlined an accord for new institutions grounded in an appeal to shared humanity. Reading Morgenthau’s speech today is a jolting reminder of how a generation of political leaders sought to remake the world. The institutional architecture – the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and what became the World Trade Organization – that emerged from Bretton Woods may have been deeply flawed. But this was an attempt to underpin through practical financial and monetary cooperation the human rights and freedoms envisaged in the UN charter. Today we need institutions equipped to rise to the great challenges posed by Covid-19, poverty and the climate crisis. Yet political leaders gripped by vaccine nationalism, climate nationalism and economic nationalism are manifestly lacking the “community of purpose” their citizens and the world need in this moment of crisis. Nowhere are the failures more starkly evident than in the financial response to the pandemic. When Covid-19 struck, governments in rich countries acted decisively to contain the social and economic impacts. Fiscal rulebooks were torn up and monetary orthodoxies abandoned. Even the most conservative finance ministers responded to the crisis like Keynesians on public finance steroids. According to the IMF, economic stimulus measures equivalent to about one-quarter of GDP were implemented. Contrasts with lower-income countries could not be more striking. Most were unable to muster more than 1-2% of GDP in increased public spending, leaving vulnerable populations unprotected and economies trapped in a downward spiral. Recession magnified pre-pandemic debt problems, leaving more than half of low-income countries either in, or at risk of, debt distress. Amid the public health crisis triggered by the pandemic, 43 lower-income countries were left spending more on debt than public health. The financing disparities have fuelled what some commentators have described as a Great Divergence. While rich countries have all but recovered the economic ground lost during the pandemic, average incomes in the poorest countries will remain below pre-pandemic levels until mid-decade. Meanwhile, budget austerity is reinforcing inequalities within countries as vital public services are cut. The human consequences have been devastating. Progress towards the 2030 sustainable development goals (SDGs) has been thrown into reverse. The number of people in poverty has increased by more than 90 million. Two decades of progress towards universal health coverage have ground to a halt, raising the spectre of setbacks in child survival and maternal health. Malnutrition is rising. Disruption to education systems could leave 70% of children in the poorest countries in “learning poverty”, lacking the skills they need to escape their circumstances. It would be folly for citizens in rich countries to imagine they will be immune to the instability and insecurity that will accompany these reversals. Yet their governments have responded with a trickle of increased aid, which gives new meaning to the phrase “too little, too late”, and a conservative approach to the governance of the Bretton Woods institutions. To be fair, the World Bank and IMF have demonstrated leadership. Commitments for the poorest countries under the bank’s International Development Association (IDA) rose by a fifth in 2021, to $36bn (£27bn). The IMF has scaled up its programmes, underwriting a surge in emergency financing, and providing $14bn in zero-interest loans to poor countries. The fund’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, navigated a new $650bn allocation of special drawing rights (SDRs) – a central bank reserve asset – through the G20. None of which is enough. Financing from the World Bank and regional development banks will provide limited protection against the fiscal retrenchment now in prospect. IMF loans are short-term and must be repaid. Under current allocation rules, two-thirds of the new SDRs will be allocated to rich countries that don’t need them. In effect, we are fighting an SDG forest fire with financial water pistols. The IMF estimates that low-income countries alone will need an additional $550bn to get back on an accelerated recovery pathway. Meanwhile, recession and human development reversals have increased the SDG financing gap by 70% to about $4.2tn, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development – and that’s without the additional $1tn needed to finance a green energy transition in developing countries. The time has come to reimagine a development financing system. More could – and should – be done on aid. The UK’s retreat on that front, most recently in slashing support for the IDA, has been profoundly harmful. But aid cannot substitute an international public finance system aligned to the SDG ambition. The World Bank and other multilateral development banks (MDBs) should be deployed far more aggressively. Less risk-averse approaches to capital adequacy and modest increases in finance would enable MDBs to triple their lending portfolios to more than $1.3tn, helping to unlock the private finance for a green recovery and deliver investment in global public goods, such as pandemic preparedness. In a period of low interest rates, this is a no-brainer. So why is the G20 endlessly reviewing options instead of acting? The new allocation of SDRs has opened up opportunities now at risk of being squandered. Rich countries do not need the $433bn in additional reserves bestowed on their central bank balance sheets through the IMF. Recycling the SDRs through multilateral banks or other mechanisms could provide developing countries with the liquidity and finance they need to support an SDG recovery and a green transition. Debt relief is critical. If there is one lesson from the 1980s, it is that delayed action on debt is the route to a lost decade of development. With IDA countries scheduled to pay $35bn in debt servicing this year, much of it to private creditors, there is an urgent need to convert unpayable debts into investments in health, education and safety nets. The IMF and World Bank should now be equipped to buy back unsustainable commercial debts at a hefty discount. John Maynard Keynes, one of the architects of the Bretton Woods system, once dismissed the argument that Britain had reached the limits of affordable social provision with a simple rejoinder: “Anything we can actually do, we can afford.” As an international community we can afford to deliver on the SDGs and prevent climate catastrophe. What we can’t afford is the alternative.

2021-07-04T12:30:04Z,Rights groups join forces to call for UK corporate accountability laws,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/04/rights-groups-join-forces-to-call-for-uk-corporate-accountability-laws,"Almost 30 organisations have joined forces to call for the UK to follow in the footsteps of its European partners by introducing corporate accountability laws requiring companies to undertake human rights and environmental due diligence across their supply chains. The groups, including the TUC, Friends of the Earth and Amnesty International, say systemic human rights abuses and environmentally destructive practices are commonplace in the global operations and supply chains of UK businesses, and voluntary approaches to tackle the problem have failed. Countries such as France, Germany and Norway have already passed laws on supply chain due diligence, while the EU is to introduce obligations on all companies operating in the single market. Those backing a new law say without it UK companies operating in the single market would be obliged to meet such obligations but those outside it would not. Mark Dearn, the director of the Corporate Justice Coalition, which is backing the call, said: “It’s not possible to ensure respect of human rights without binding laws tackling business abuses of rights – which occur with impunity in the global supply chains of multinational corporations. “The UK portrays itself as a leader on business and human rights, but this simply isn’t true. There are no UK laws to hold corporations liable for human rights abuses and the Modern Slavery Act doesn’t guarantee that supply chains are free from modern slavery. Meanwhile, countries around Europe are creating new laws that will go far beyond any obligation placed on UK companies.” The 29 groups backing a new law, which also include Labour Behind the Label, Unison and Christian Aid, say it is vital to ensure the delivery of the United Nations’ sustainable development goals and to meeting G7 commitments to respect human rights. At last month’s G7 summit, hosted by Boris Johnson, the leaders committed “to ensure that global supply chains are free from the use of forced labour”. A government spokesperson said: “The government is committed to eradicating modern slavery from the global economy and increasing transparency in supply chains, and we will go further than ever before to clamp down on illegal deforestation and protect rainforests, thanks to world-leading new laws being introduced through the landmark environment bill. “We actively encourage businesses to do their due diligence and identify, prevent and account for potential risks in their operations and throughout their supply chain relationships.”",Corporate social responsibility; Human rights; TUC; Amnesty International; Friends of the Earth; Law; Environment; Business; UK news; Trade policy; European Union; Europe; Politics; Trade unions; World news; Modern slavery,Environment
2021-10-31T14:17:29Z,The west caused the climate crisis – it should now pay to clean up the mess | Lazarus Chakwera,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/31/west-climate-crisis-cop26-africa-develop-global-heating,"When will rich countries take responsibility? Last week, ahead of Cop26 in Glasgow, it was revealed that many of them had lobbied against the UN’s climate recommendations – namely that urgent action is needed. At the same time, some questioned the need to fund poorer countries to adapt to the effects of climate change – despite the failure by developed countries to deliver the $100bn (£75bn) they had pledged. Africa has done little to create the climate crisis. Yet the locust plagues in the Horn of Africa, the first climate change famine in Madagascar and the water crises in southern Africa are all evidence that my continent is already paying the price of others’ emissions. The fund that some would like diminished is not charity, but a cleaning fee that must be paid. To compound this, wealthy countries are also imposing energy transition on Africa that risks doing great harm. Several governments and multilateral lending institutions are banning funding for fossil-fuel infrastructure – and encouraging others to follow suit. This may sound logical on paper, but it rules out transitioning through natural gas, the cleanest fossil fuel. And in practice, it only applies to poor countries, while richer countries face few bans on developing or importing gas. Africans have a right to electricity. But renewables cannot yet fully service their needs and aspirations. Storage technologies are not advanced enough to make solar, wind and other intermittent energy sources dependable. Access to electricity – one of the UN’s sustainable development goals – means more than charging a phone through a solar panel. It is about the on-demand, sustained and intensive energy needed to power industrialisation, build infrastructure, create jobs and ultimately lift citizens from poverty. Africa is the world’s least electrified continent and almost 600 million people lack reliable access. If, excluding South Africa, sub-Saharan electricity consumption tripled overnight powered by natural gas, global emissions would rise by only 0.62%. In addition to powering manufacturing, gas would also underwrite agricultural development and food security. Energy-intensive irrigation systems will be needed to modernise farms. So too will synthetic fertiliser, the most efficient feedstock of which is natural gas. As droughts and crop failure become more common, both will be in ever greater demand to keep the continent fed. Dealing with climate change means also dealing with its consequences. Efficient transport infrastructure, food security and reliable energy grids are all needed to mitigate against natural disasters such as droughts and flooding. The more developed a country, the more resilient. And if clean natural gas replaces charcoal and other poisonous biomasses for indoor cooking, hundreds of thousands of lives, mostly those of women and children, will be saved across the continent. Currently the favoured energy unit across the continent is the diesel-powered generator. Unless a reliable alternative is offered, this dirtier practice will persist – because a choice between no energy or dirty energy is no choice for individuals and businesses in the developing world. Importantly, tapping gas resources does not preclude renewables in Africa’s energy mix. The continent already draws much from such sources. Malawi, for instance, gets more than 80% of its electricity from hydropower. A more nuanced approach is needed if climate equity and justice are to be respected. When the concepts were written into the 2015 Paris accord to combat climate change, it meant two things. First, countries that had become rich through hydrocarbons had a duty to cut emissions faster to allow poorer countries to develop. Second, those same countries had a responsibility to help undeveloped countries adapt to the adverse conditions they did not create. The impacts of the climate crisis are inherently unfair. They are spread unevenly across the globe, with Africa the continent most at risk. To strike a global deal in Paris, these different rights and responsibilities, duties and obligations had to be weighed, debated and then ratified. But blanket gas bans for the developing world show the west has forgotten the first principle. Repeated failure to mobilise the promised billions in climate aid shows that it has ignored the second – not just an act of dishonour, but of betrayal as well. If countries with the greatest capacity to effect change do not, those with more modest means should not be expected to do so. At Cop26, the west must show that it is now fit for the challenge and will finally fulfil its obligations. Only then will equity and justice become more than a mere slogan.

2021-07-05T16:23:37Z,Alan Dean obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jul/05/alan-dean-obituary,"Thanks to his keen sense of humour, my friend Alan Dean, who has died aged 63 of a heart attack, had a large following among young people through his mentoring programme Burning2Learn, which he founded in Swanley, Kent, in 2005. It offered work-related learning to several hundred young people, initially through construction projects. The aim was to build self-esteem, confidence and motivation. Alan became their mentor, champion, confident and sounding board. As alternatives to the classroom, he took the students to motor and superbike racing events, including at Brands Hatch, Silverstone, Donington Park, Imola, Monza, Misano, Laguna Seca, Phillip Island and Valencia. He used these trips as a way of subtly imparting maths, English and science skills. They met the Prince of Wales through the Prince’s Trust. These were opportunities they could not have imagined if it hadn’t been for Alan’s innovation and encouragement. In 2006 they formed a B2L media team whose activities included writing conference reports. One of his B2L proteges, Maria Peters, remembers asking Alan what the secret of his family life was. He replied: “We have never stopped laughing.” Alan was born in Croydon, south London, the son of Ken and Vi, who ran a family grocery store called Ken Tea in Nunhead. Aged seven, Alan was diagnosed with a hole in his heart. He had surgery and made a full recovery. He went to Swanley secondary school before joining his parents’ business. In 1991, he founded Alan Dean and Associates, a construction company for commercial and residential properties in Swanley, and became chairman of the Swanley chamber of commerce. He encouraged youngsters in local schools to consider the benefits of vocational careers, including bricklaying, plastering and landscaping. He met Janet Izzard on the dance floor at a Saturday night club in Hastings in 1977. They were married in 1982, on the day that Tottenham won the FA Cup final. In 1983, the Ken Tea Store morphed into a door and timber business, which grew into the construction company. Alan became a passionate advocate for the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. He joined the Ecological Sequestration Trust and the Pivot Projects, both of which work for sustainability. He will be remembered for his catchphrase at the end of every conversation: “You look after you.” Alan is survived by Janet and their daughter, Rachel, and by his brother, David.",Construction industry; Young people; Vocational education; Sustainable development,Business
2021-09-23T05:00:40Z,"More than 100 countries face spending cuts as Covid worsens debt crisis, report warns",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/sep/23/more-than-100-countries-face-spending-cuts-as-covid-worsens-debt-crisis-report-warns,"More than 100 countries face cuts to public spending on health, education and social protection as the Covid-19 pandemic compounds already high levels of debt, a new report says. The International Monetary Fund believes that 35 to 40 countries are “debt distressed” – defined as when a country is experiencing difficulties in servicing its debt, such as when there are arrears or debt restructuring. However, this figure is a “gross underestimation”, according to the study, led by the Pathfinders for Peaceful, Just and Inclusive Societies, based at New York University’s Center on International Cooperation. Unsustainable rising debt levels have seen inequality widening between high-income countries and those in the global south, researchers said. “We compiled a list of countries that are labelled as debt-distressed across a number of criteria, and estimate around 100 countries will have to reduce budget deficits in this period, even though the majority are still facing the third or fourth wave of the [Covid-19] pandemic,” the report said. “Furthermore, the ability to cancel this debt is complicated because many of these countries have taken on debt under non-concessional terms from private lenders. The trends in [the UN’s] Financing for Development (FFD) were entirely insufficient to meet the SDGs [sustainable development goals] even prior to Covid-19. Now there is a full-blown crisis.” Countries falling into debt distress include Tunisia, which has seen political upheaval, as well as Zambia and Ghana, said Faiza Shaheen, lead author of the report, which is being launched to coincide with a UN general assembly meeting of world leaders on Thursday. Zambia was the first African county to default on debt last year during the pandemic and now has to allocate 44% of its annual government revenue to creditors, Shaheen said. Ghana spends about 37% of its national budget on debt interest payments. In 2019, the cost of servicing external debts in 64 countries exceeded what they spent on healthcare, she said. Cameroon spent 23.8% of its budget on debt payments, compared with 3.9% of the country’s revenue spent on health. Researchers used a variety of indicators to identify countries deemed vulnerable due to rising level of debts, including their debt-to-GDP ratio, their debt-to-export ratio, as well as countries labelled as fiscally vulnerable by the UN Development Programme. The country’s credit rating and growth trajectory were compared with its debt-service burden. “The Covid-19 pandemic has brought to head a debt distress crisis that has been brewing since the aftermath of the 2008 global recession,” said Shaheen. “The situation is made worse as poor and middle-income countries are getting in more debt to buy vaccines, or having to rely on the UN’s Covax, which only promises 20% of vaccine coverage by the end of the year,” she said. “The dynamics of global debt, which mean rich countries can borrow cheaply and employ huge fiscal stimulus packages while low and middle-income countries have to cut back, mean that global inequalities are likely to widen.” Shaheen said richer countries had spent on average about 6.5% of GDP on Covid-19 fiscal stimulus, which is almost twice the 3.3% of GDP spent by countries at risk of abrupt fiscal consolidation, defined as when government policies become focused on reducing deficits and debt, such as through austerity measures. “We’ve heard a lot about the rhetoric of ‘building back better’, but of course these countries don’t have the money to do that; they don’t have it in terms of their borrowing and debt situations and they also often have a low tax base as well.” Researchers polled people in eight countries on their concerns about inequalities and the policy priorities of their governments. “We’ve been talking to people around the world, and the polling is clear that people don’t want their governments to cut – they want their governments to spend more,” said Shaheen. “If nothing changes and governments face having to make cuts, populations will see development stall and even reverse. For the person on the street, it means they are going to visibly see that it’s harder to access key services, and they’re not going to see improvements in their material wellbeing.”",Global development; Debt relief; Coronavirus; Public services policy; World news; Poverty; Health; Society; Sustainable development goals; Health policy; Inequality; Social exclusion; Education; International Monetary Fund (IMF); Global economy; United Nations,Global development
2021-10-22T11:00:33Z,Britain’s ‘hostile environment’ fails the victims of modern-day slavery | Andrew Wallis,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/22/britain-hostile-environment-modern-day-slavery-brexit,"Once Britain could claim to be a world leader in its response to modern slavery. How times change. This week a report has highlighted how Brexit and immigration policy could result in more forced labour exploitation. It’s what we in the anti-slavery movement have been saying to ministers for some time. If only they would listen. The government’s stated commitment to tackling modern slavery is to be commended. In 2015 it introduced the Modern Slavery Act, which set out a range of measures for dealing with slavery and human trafficking. One notable feature was a requirement that companies with a turnover of £36m or more, and who carry out business in the UK, must annually disclose all they are doing to tackle modern slavery. The act was a groundbreaking piece of legislation. It showed the rest of the world that we were serious about stamping out forced labour, human trafficking, domestic servitude and other forms of exploitation that cause untold misery and suffering. Since then, apart from a slight dip during the Covid-19 lockdowns, reported numbers of those in modern slavery seeking help have increased nearly tenfold since 2012. There is, it is worth saying, a silver lining to these figures. As a society, we’re seeing increasing reports of exploitation, as awareness grows among the public, and professionals in the police, NHS, local authorities and other frontline services. There have even been major storylines on modern slavery in the hit TV series Line of Duty and Shetland, and on Radio 4’s The Archers. We’re lifting the lid on forced labour, the most prevalent form of slavery, as a growing number of companies take the issue seriously and look more closely at their supply chains and how they conduct their business. And we now have better reporting mechanisms, such as the UK modern slavery and exploitation helpline, which help bring the issue out into the open. But the government increasingly seems out of step with any progress we are making. Its increasingly “hostile environment” immigration policy, central to this week’s Greta report, is at odds with its ambition to root out modern slavery. It focuses on a person’s right to be in the UK rather than spotting the signs of exploitation, and erroneously re-conflates two separate issues: immigration and modern slavery. Since Brexit, for example, all non-UK victims of exploitation identified in this country no longer have the right to remain when they leave the national referral mechanism, the government’s support system for victims of modern slavery and human trafficking. If they’re sent back to where they were exploited in the first place, they are susceptible to being re-exploited. There is also the risk that faced with returning to their home country, survivors will simply go underground and disappear. With no documents and no way of getting a legitimate job, it’s a green light for criminals to take advantage of them once again. Similarly, the new nationality and borders bill, currently making its way through parliament, will discourage victims of exploitation from coming forward through fear of deportation. Anti-slavery organisations are part of a growing number of human rights organisations opposing the bill in its current form and pushing for significant amendments. The modern slavery picture is complex. At the risk of stating the obvious, there are no easy solutions. But to properly address the problem, the government needs to begin by rowing back on its nationality and borders bill. It also needs to send a signal to the business community that it is going to get tough with companies that flout their obligations under the Modern Slavery Act. Six years on from the legislation, there are still more than 5,500 qualifying UK companies that are not disclosing what they are doing to tackle modern slavery. Not one of them has ever been sanctioned. Ministers also need to better understand the full cost of what they are dealing with. The government estimates that at any one time between 10,000 and 13,000 people are in situations of slavery in the UK. Experts, however, put the real figure in excess of 100,000. A greater understanding of the scale of the problem should create a greater sense of urgency and focus. And if the human suffering fails to focus politicians’ minds, consider the economic impact. The government’s estimates put the annual cost of modern slavery to the UK economy at £3.3bn to £4.3bn. This is based on its assessment of 10,000 to 13,000 people in slavery. If the actual number is more than 100,000 – tenfold more – then is the genuine annual cost closer to £40bn? That’s eyewatering by anyone’s standards. It’s time for a renewed focus and proportionate responses to modern slavery. After all, according to the UN’s sustainable development goals, we are meant to have eradicated it by 2030. These latest figures throw doubt on whether we’ll even come close to achieving that. Andrew Wallis is CEO of the anti-slavery charity Unseen. In 2015 he was awarded an OBE for his work that led to the landmark UK Modern Slavery Act",UK news; Politics; Immigration and asylum; Modern slavery,Opinion
2020-09-19T07:15:10Z,Looking for a Saturday night film? Instead of Notting Hill try Nations United | Richard Curtis,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/sep/19/looking-for-a-saturday-night-film-instead-of-notting-hill-try-nations-united,"I’m aware this is a strange article to be writing. As most people struggle with the day-to-day complexity of life under the pandemic, how we do find the headspace to think about something as global as the sustainable development goals? But I’m inspired by a recent article by the activist and author Arundhati Roy. “Historically, pandemics have forced humans to break with the past and imagine their world anew. This one is no different. It is a portal, a gateway between one world and the next,” she wrote. And for me, the roadmap on this journey comes from the global goals – the superdetailed blueprint, agreed by 193 countries in 2015, for transformation for people and planet by 2030. About a year ago, I wrote in the Guardian, along with some of my fellow SDG advocates, that, with only a decade to go, we were in an alarming position where we were still not on track to achieve these goals. Then, in January of this year, 20 leading gender, climate, environmental, equality, justice and human rights campaigners – backed by 2,000 more advocates – signed an open letter. It was an unusual letter, because I think it’s one of the first times that activists fighting for such a range of global causes were united by one single voice. We called 2020 the Super Year to kick off a decade of action. Then look what happened. Now, I am an optimist, but nobody could have foreseen the devastation and immense challenges of 2020. Covid-19 has shone a truly harsh light on the issues of the world today. Billions of people have been in lockdown for months. Lives and livelihoods have been threatened and lost. The recent Goalkeepers report from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation gives a grim warning that 25 years of immunisation progress has been wiped out in just 25 weeks and there has been a 7% increase in extreme poverty. But perhaps this is still the moment to feel hope. This year has seen the greatest rise in social moments ever – for gender, for climate, for racial justice. Covid-19 has shown how quickly things can change and how people will change the way they live their lives. We’re seeing people questioning more: “What can I actually do, myself, in my own life?” We’re changing the clothes we buy, the food we eat, the way we travel and the cars we drive. And in the world of business and investment, there’s a huge acceleration in awareness of the massive responsibility of those sectors – and it’s not morals v money. Sustainable investments are doing better than traditional ones. The people with power in that world must be the necessary heroes. On the wall in my office are the words, “To Make Things Happen, You’ve Got to Make Things.” Can I recommend to readers a few films? (Not The King of Staten Island, although that’s good). The first is a film that the WWF have made called Our Planet: Too Big to Fail. It’s on Netflix and it’s a devastating analysis of the effect of business on our planet, with five crucial actions that have to be taken to make sure we don’t descend into a world on fire. It’s 40 minutes long, beautiful, Mark Carney looks very handsome in it – and it’s got this great editing technique that whenever anyone is talking, they cut to brilliant images of leaf-carrying ants, orangutans or polar bears. I wish we’d done that in some of the duller bits of Notting Hill. I’ve also been part of making a short film in partnership with the UN called Nations United, which is being shown on YouTube, Sky and other broadcasters today. It was made to mark the 75th anniversary of the UN and the fifth anniversary of the global goals. It’s a whistlestop tour through some of the most urgent problems facing the world and reflects a new determination by the UN to push for urgent specific solutions on climate, gender, justice and poverty. And we’ve got a cast I wish I’d had in one of my dodgy films – Malala Yousafzai, Thandie Newton, Don Cheadle, Forest Whitaker, Michelle Yeoh and Burna Boy on cracking form alongside the UN secretary general, António Guterres. There’s even a radio version voiced by my old friend Julia Roberts. Nelson Mandela said: “It always seems impossible until it’s done.” This is a time for intensity and intense action. Greater investment in health and education, decent green jobs, investing in renewable energy rather than subsiding fossil fuels and, at last, changing gender discriminatory laws. We actually know what to do – it’s a question of public pressure moving political will and I guess all of us taking personal responsibility for that. Five years on, I’m convinced that the global goals are more relevant than ever. They’re a global plan agreed with a clear to do list for what we need to do for people and planet. We can’t give up now. • Watch Nations United: Urgent Solutions for Urgent Times, premiering on YouTube at 9am ET / 2pm BST on Saturday 19 September. • Richard Curtis is a writer, director and UN sustainable development goals advocate",Global development; Sustainable development goals; United Nations; Richard Curtis,Global development
2021-11-01T04:49:46Z,New Zealand plan to halve greenhouse gas emissions criticised as an ‘accounting trick’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/01/new-zealand-plan-to-halve-greenhouse-gases-criticised-as-an-accounting-trick,"Climate change experts have warned that New Zealand has employed “accounting tricks” to create a target for greenhouse gas emissions cuts that looks far more ambitious than it really is. On Sunday the country pledged to halve its emissions by 2030 aspart of the Paris agreement to limit global warming to 1.5C. The announcement was made on the eve of the United Nations Cop26 climate conference. The previous target, known as a nationally determined contribution (NDC), was to reduce emissions by an average of 30% from 2005 levels, over the 2021-2030 period. The updated NDC, has a target of reducing net emissions by 50% below the gross 2005 levels come 2030, or to reduce average annual net emissions over the next decade to 41% below 2005 gross levels. The target roughly aligns with commitments by the European Union, Newsroom reports, the primary difference being that the European Union aims to reduce most of its emissions within its own borders. New Zealand, on the other hand, expects that less than a third of its emissions will be reduced onshore. While New Zealand’s share of global greenhouse gas emissions is small, its gross emissions per capita are high and it is one of the world’s worst performers on emission increases. Emissions in New Zealand rose 57% between 1990 and 2018 – the second-greatest increase of all industrialised countries. Earlier this year, data showed New Zealand’s emissions had increased by 2% in 2018-19. The Climate Action Tracker has given the country a “highly insufficient” rating, pointing out that despite net-zero emissions by 2050 being enshrined in law, the government’s policies focus too heavily on offsetting carbon overseas and through forestry, rather than addressing the root causes such as agriculture. Bill Hare, from Climate Analytics, a partner organisation to Climate Action Tracker said New Zealand’s latest announcement employs “various accounting tricks”. “The headline target that the government has put forward as a 50% reduction from 2005 levels of emissions is what the general public hears, however the government has taken a number of unusual accounting approaches that, when analysed, indicate that the real emission reductions achieved compared to 2005 levels of net emissions is only 22-23%,” he said. “The allowed net emissions in 2030 are calculated as a percentage of gross emissions in 2005, essentially comparing apples and oranges. Gross emissions in 2005 was significantly higher than 2005 emissions.” Global industry campaign manager at Oil Change International, David Tong, said it was similar to the difference between looking at gross income, and pay after tax. “What’s been compared is a total emissions in 2005, to our total emissions, if we achieve this target, in 2030, less the sequestration from forestry and other carbon sequestration within New Zealand. So those are two different data sets.” Part of the problem, is that the government is using Kyoto Protocol accounting rules, which have become less common, rather than the International Panel on Climate Change data method. “If you want to compare our targets to what is necessary for 1.5C, as both the prime minister and minister James Shaw have done, then it’s really important that you use the same numbers as the world’s top scientists,” he said. Professor Bronwyn Hayward, from the University of Canterbury and an author for the IPCC report, said Climate Action Tracker has long argued that if New Zealand’s commitments are to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5˚C, the country should set a 2030 target to reduce gross emissions by at least 44%. “What we have done instead is to set an estimated net target of 41%. There will now be political debate about whether this meets the 1.5 target.” Lawyers for Climate Action NZ Inc spokesperson, James Every-Palmer QC, said that while the target sounded good and is a significant improvement on the current NDC, it is not as good as it sounds. “The climate does not care about our clever accounting choices, it cares about the level of net emissions. And our failure to walk-the-talk will be apparent to our trading partners in our United Nations framework convention on climate change reporting.” The climate minister James Shaw said while the first priority was to reduce emissions domestically, the country will also boost its emissions reductions through buying overseas carbon credits. “We will then add to this by working to reduce emissions in other parts of the world. The priority here will be to support developing countries in the Asia-Pacific to meet their sustainable development goals. But Professor Ralph Sims, from Massey University said: “forest sinks only buy us time, and buying international credits is yet to be agreed under Paris COP rules and remains questionable with double-counting a risk”. Forest and Bird’s chief executive Kevin Hague said the government was relying too heavily on other countries to do the work. “Unless the government delivers a much better plan to cut emissions that what we have seen so far this target will be mostly met by buying carbon credits from other countries. That’s a government subsidy to polluters like the dairy industry.” With the target set, and the country’s emissions reduction plan due in May 2022, the most important thing now was for action to back up the ambitions, Hayward said. “It’s meeting them that is the big challenge as we work to make these cuts to our emissions real in all sectors of the economy, and to dramatically increase our efforts to protect people and businesses from increasingly chaotic climate futures.”",New Zealand; Cop26; Climate crisis; Emissions trading; Asia Pacific; Environment,World news

Directed at the world leaders who in 2015 agreed a series of UN global goals – including tackling gender inequality, ending global warming and eradicating hunger by 2030 – the letter declares a state of emergency for people and planet. “We need you to act faster,” the letter reads. “To find the finance. To track implementation. To unlock radical solutions.” It continues: “We are watching you. And we will fight every day, for people, for planet. There are not just a few of us – there are millions with one voice and one question: how will you keep your promise and deliver dramatic progress towards the global goals this year?” The letter follows last week’s warning by António Guterres, the UN secretary general, that the world was still “off track” on delivering the global goals. Although headway has been made on ending extreme poverty, “progress has been slow or even reversed” on all other global goals, a UN report found last year. Environmentalist Jane Goodall said it was time for “those in power [to] now step up and play their part”. “Now is the time for action if we are to achieve the global goals that world leaders have committed to. Not next year, not in five years – but now, in 2020. We all have a role to play. My global programme for young people, Roots &amp; Shoots, is planting 5m trees in this year alone.” Tarana Burke, the #MeToo movement founder, said the goals “build on a vision of a world in which women and girls can live free from violence, harassment and discrimination”. “That’s why we must use these goals as a tool to hold our leaders to account and to boost all our efforts. I’m proud to stand with climate campaigners, human rights defenders, education activists today to send a clear message to leaders that these goals are all our goals. We are ready – and we are watching – for action.” The letter was backed by a number of other actors and celebrities, including Emilia Clarke, Ryan Reynolds and Emma Watson, as well as campaign groups and charities such as Amnesty International, the International Rescue Committee, WaterAid and the YMCA.",Sustainable development goals; Global development; Environmental sustainability; Climate crisis; Inequality and development; Inequality; Sustainable development; World news; Environment,Global development
2021-10-11T15:49:28Z,"Day of the Girl is critical, but support is needed year-round, say campaigners",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/oct/11/day-of-the-girl-is-critical-but-support-is-needed-year-round-say-campaigners,"International Day of the Girl is critical in highlighting girls’ rights globally, but action is urgently needed to reverse the damage of the pandemic, campaigners have said. “Girls who were once hopeful about their futures say to us: ‘We’re not sure if we’re going to achieve our dreams now, if we’re ever going to go back to school’,” said Emily Wilson, chief executive of UK and Uganda-based organisation Irise International, which works to combat period poverty. The Day of the Girl, celebrated each year on 11 October, is core to the charity’s funding drives, with donations on the day contributing up to 10% of its yearly income. “There is always a risk that girls’ rights becomes an add-on,” said Wilson. “So these mainstream peaks in engagement on days like today have really helped change attitudes. The Day of the Girl gives us the opportunity to share our reports with policymakers, and push the issues we work on all year more centre-stage.” Mwangala Mukelabai, Zambian representative for the Campaign for Female Education (Camfed), who is taking over the NGO’s Twitter account to share her journey of activism for girls’ education, agreed. “Girl child day is important to me because it is on this day that we make sure the voices of girls are heard and highlight the challenges that they face to the world,” she said. This year’s International Day of the Girl, which was adopted by the UN in 2011, makes closing the digital gender gap its focus. Maliha Abidi, a 25-year-old Pakistan-born artist and neuroscience student, is launching Women Rise, a collection of 10,000 non-fungible tokens (NFTs), unique digital assets stored on blockchain that can be bought and sold online, representing the work of female activists, artists, coders and scientists. “When I was looking through pages of different NFTs, one thing was so clear: this is a guys’ field,” said Abidi. “I only connected with very few women.” Abidi said she hoped her project would drive more girls into the tech and blockchain industries. But in a world where men are up to 50% more likely to access the internet than women, more work needed to be done to ensure girls don’t miss out on the technology boom. Abidi said governments and institutions must prioritise girls at risk of dropping out of education early, if the gender digital divide is to be closed. “When we talk about the digital world in connection to girls’ education, or girls in general, it’s not just about connecting girls to the internet.” Leaders must ensure girls interested in Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects can stay in those fields, all the way from school to university to a job, she said. “It’s about helping them reach that finishing point.” On this year’s Day of the Girl, campaigners have also called for urgent action to undo – or at least minimise – the harm caused by the pandemic. Many countries have made great strides in girls’ rights over the past 10 years. In 2015, the UN made gender equality one of its 17 sustainable development goals for 2030. In 2014, the African Union launched a continent-wide campaign to end child marriage, encouraging its 55 member states to pass laws, make action plans and support communities. In the run-up to Day of the Girl last October, girls’ equality charity Plan International kickstarted its #FreeToBeOnline campaign. It led to more than 66,000 people signing an open letter urging social media companies to protect girls from abuse and harassment. Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp agreed to team up with young people to discuss solutions for girls’ online safety. In 2017, 24 girls in Ecuador, supported by Plan International, drafted a resolution addressing violence against girls to the national assembly. But the Covid-19 pandemic has seriously curtailed hard-fought gains. Wilson said in Uganda, Irise has had to cancel its menstruation education programmes in schools, which remain closed. The organisation has instead diverted resources to tackling the rise in child marriage and teenage pregnancies among the estimated 10 million Ugandan girls who have missed out on an education since last March. Olutope Olatilewa, the Nigeria-based founder of mentoring programme African ChangeMakers Women Network, said: “Society is confused about where to place the girl child; she is caught in between the categories of women’s rights and children’s rights. But little visibility is given to girls’ rights specifically.” Her mentoring scheme across 54 African countries aims to build leadership skills. “But even that is not enough – we are just scratching the surface of what we must do.” The global network Girls Not Brides said the spike in donations and support for girls received on 11 October needs to continue throughout the rest of the year for there to be long-term change. While rates of child marriage have gone down over the past decade, the decline is not fast enough to end the practice by 2030, said Nerida Nthamburi, a Kenya-based partnership officer for Girls Not Brides. The group estimates that progress must become six times faster to meet the UN target. The Day of the Girl is critical to the movement, said Nthamburi, because “it creates a deliberate platform that focuses attention on the seldom-heard voices of girls who know best – girls who have felt the pain and live through the risk [of child marriage] every day”. “Unless we accelerate progress as a global community – governments, leaders, parents and religious leaders – we are likely to see a rollback,” said Nthamburi.",International Day of the Girl; Global development; Women's rights and gender equality; Global education; Child marriage; Society; World news; Women,Global development

It’s forecast to be 89% more energy efficient than a typical UK hotel and has a host of sustainable measures, from solar panels to recycled furniture, zero food waste and a wildflower roof. It’s the brainchild of owner Robert Godwin, who is passionate about driving a cultural shift in an industry where sustainability is often an afterthought. I didn’t think an overnight hotel stay could make me think about climate change, but here it does, and not in a preachy way. The staff are all on board and proud of their sustainable goals – and all the small details add up. As we arrive, someone is picking up an order from Too Good To Go, an app that connects people to restaurants and shops that have a food surplus, and the lobby is packed with plants and upcycled furniture. Another welcome innovation is flexibility: check-in is from 2pm, as is check-out, so you get a full 24 hours to make the most of your stay. Each room has a kitchenette – hence the hometel moniker – so it’s great for those who want to keep costs down by self-catering. Coffee and delicious food are available in the Boca restaurant on the ground floor – more on that later. Our studio is flooded with light from big Crittall windows and has everything you could expect from a boutique stay: big, comfy bed with crisp linen, Roberts radio, calming colour scheme and the kitchen is fully-equipped. I never thought I would get so excited about rubbish, but the three-in-one bin in the room – for food waste, mixed recycling and general waste – really makes us mindful of what we are using. Godwin tells us he looked at 200 bins from around the world, couldn’t find one that fitted his ethos, and came up with this design. “We needed the right ones to encourage our guests to recycle in the right way,” says Godwin. “All of the waste is compartmentalised and sent to different plants for mixed recycling or renewable energy. And all food waste goes to a new life.” There are natural textures everywhere: wood flooring, a blue-and-white striped fabric headboard, rattan chairs and a cork bench. A wooden Do Not Disturb sign, Post-it notes made of recycled paper, and pens and pencils which guests are asked to leave behind after use for future guests are nice touches. Features such as the bespoke marble-print wallpaper in the bathroom and the Dali-esque handcrafted mirrors were inspired by Chiswick’s Arts and Crafts heritage. And any carbon emissions from unavoidable items such as the biggish television are offset by a tree-planting scheme with its reforesting partner in Nicaragua. The energy-efficient shower – said to use 40% less water – is huge and powerful enough for any long-stayer. Bath towels are generously sized, and heavenly smelling body wash and shampoo come in dispensers from vegan brand Doers of London. Carpets on the corridors are made from recycled fishing nets, and in the basement there’s a 24-hour laundry and a gym with Peloton bikes, weights and yoga mats. The real behind-the-scenes savings are in energy use, according to Godwin. “We are forecast to be 89% more energy efficient than a typical UK hotel and that’s largely through minimising heat and energy loss. We are built to new regulations and, collectively, it’s a massive improvement.” Those improvements include a ground source heat pump, solar panels, motion sensors in the rooms, a green roof with 75,000 bees and wildflowers for biodiversity and insulation, and a blue roof to capture rainwater and minimise local flooding. Any additional power will be bought from solar, wind and hydro sources. Two lab rooms monitor the efficiency of the building and how guests use power and energy in their rooms. So why is the hotel industry lagging behind on sustainability? “I think it’s a lack of will, and that comes from a lack of knowledge,” says Godwin, whose epiphany came after a trip to South Africa in 2019 where he saw first-hand the effects of climate change in droughts and collapsing food chains. He is now seen as a trailblazer, with big hotel chains including Hilton coming to him for advice. In the Boca restaurant kitchen, there are no big fryers or extractor fans, and the menu, created by head chef Elisabetta Boi, has been adapted to be low energy. Boi tells us she is sourcing locally where she can, and bringing a taste of her Italian heritage. Zero waste is the aim here, too: potato peelings are made into vodka and any other waste is recycled or available on the Too Good To Go app. We try some sample dishes of what is to come when Boca fully opens on 1 February, and they all pack a punch in flavour. There is delicious homemade focaccia with wholemeal flour, risotto with black truffle and parmesan, and a white radicchio salad with figs and house-made fresh ricotta. Puddings are a tiramisu with mascarpone and a mouthwatering panettone filled with ice-cream. Starters are from £8 and mains from £10.50, pretty much the going rate in Chiswick. Next morning we grab a coffee and head off to Chiswick High Road, just paces away. There is no need for a car park at room2, as public transport is so good. Turnham Green station is three minutes’ walk away, from where it’s a 20-minute tube journey into central London. There are frequent buses to Kew Gardens or Richmond Park, or you can wander down to the Thames to admire the houses of leading Arts and Crafts figures Emery Walker and William Morris. Morris urged people to have nothing in their house that wasn’t beautiful or useful. Room2 has beauty and utility in abundance, and shows that being net zero doesn’t have to mean compromising on comfort or style.

2021-04-08T17:06:40Z,Strong trade unions are vital to the UK’s economic recovery | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/apr/08/strong-trade-unions-are-vital-to-the-uks-economic-recovery,"Martin Kettle’s review of Joe Biden’s approach to economic regeneration (In the US, Joe Biden is backing the unions. Britain can only look on in envy, 7 April) was welcome, but we question whether it went far enough in its endorsement or reach. The success of Franklin D Roosevelt’s original New Deal owed much to the positive role offered by a confident and expanded union movement in governance of the project. Furthermore, there is little doubt that, both in the US and UK, at times of national emergency during two world wars, trade unions made significant contributions to the war effort, politically and on the manufacturing shop floor. After the second world war, it was British unions that encouraged the introduction of worker directors and the co-determination system, which provided the means for reviving the German economy – a system still operating in that country and across Europe, to the benefit of employees and employers. The case for supporting union revival becomes even clearer as we confront not just the consequences of the pandemic but also the emerging climate emergency. There is little doubt that while British industry has done regrettably little in confronting environmental despoliation, trade unions have been actively engaging with other partners in developing the green new deals that will be essential for securing sustainable economic development. These deals can offer tripartite supervision of the economy to oversee progress toward the 2015 Paris accord and the UN’s sustainable development goals; partnership agreements between unions and employers to ensure just transitions to green and secure jobs; and progress towards reducing the growing inequality that blights the UK. Jeff Hyman Professor emeritus, University of Aberdeen Chris Baldry Professor emeritus, Stirling University • Martin Kettle is right that Joe Biden’s decision to promote decent conditions and respect at work, and to tie this into the collective organisation of trade unions, is something that is much-needed in Britain. Ten years of a Tory government should be sufficient reminder that in the present day only a Labour government will do anything on this agenda. However, that is the first, not the last, word. Kettle thinks some unions are stuck in the past, but then criticises those leaders who are critical of Keir Starmer, as if himself wanting a return to the days when unions sometimes represented not so much the interests of their members as the perspectives of the leaders and their desire for political careers. Certainly, many trade unions and trade unionists would hope and work for a Labour government. They’d also expect to shape and influence its policies in relevant areas. That is surely what US unions have successfully done with Biden.

2021-06-30T16:00:43Z,Billions pledged to tackle gender inequality at UN forum,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jun/30/billions-pledged-to-tackle-gender-inequality-at-un-forum,"Billions of pounds will be pledged to support efforts to tackle gender inequality this week at the largest international conference on women’s rights in more than 25 years. The Generation Equality Forum, hosted in Paris by UN Women and the governments of France and Mexico, will launch plans to radically speed up progress over the next five years. After two years of consultation between governments, feminist and women’s rights groups, philanthropic foundations, the private sector and UN agencies, the three-day forum takes place amid concerns the pandemic has exacerbated a crisis in women’s rights. An estimated 47 million more women will fall into extreme poverty due to Covid, according to the World Economic Forum. And the International Labour Organization has said unemployment for women rose by 9 million in 2020 compared to 2019 and is projected to increase by another 2 million in 2021. The pattern for men is different – they are projected to see unemployment decrease in 2021. “The world has been fighting for gender equality for decades, but progress has been slow. Now is the chance to reignite a movement and deliver real change,” said Melinda French Gates, co-chair of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, which announced a new commitment of $2.1bn (£1.5bn) over five years to economic empowerment, health and family planning, and accelerating women in leadership. “The beauty of our fight for gender equality is that every human being will gain from it.” French Gates said that while there has been some progress since the fourth world conference on women brought 47,000 activists to Beijing in 1995, nowhere in the world are women on equal footing with men. Waves of opposition to women’s rights have emerged, and structural barriers still exist. Other pledges of funding, and legislative changes, will be announced in six areas: gender-based violence, economic justice, sexual and reproductive health rights, climate justice, technology and innovation and feminist movements and leadership. A compact addressing women’s role in peace and security and gender equality in humanitarian programming is also due to be unveiled. In response to the pandemic exacerbating digital inequities, the Global Fund for Women will launch its System Reboot campaign to support feminist technology innovators in the developing world and to “mobilise technology as a force for gender justice”. The Ford Foundation, which last year sold its social bonds to raise cash to help tackle the economic fallout of the pandemic, will pledge $420m (£300m) over five years. Nicolette Naylor, a programme director at the foundation, said talk about gender equality had not been matched by action. “As some parts of the world start to emerge from the pandemic, it is essential that gender equality is at the heart of building back better. It’s time to stop talking and start funding the organisations that are driving change and the necessary progress on global gender equality.” Heads of state from Sweden, Finland, Argentina, Kenya, South Africa and Tunisia will join French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Mexican president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, in person. While online, US vice-president, Kamala Harris, is due to speak and former US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, is also scheduled to appear. Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, executive director of UN Women, said the forum was a reaction to the slowness of achieving both the Beijing action plan and the UN’s sustainable development goals, and made more urgent by the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on women. “Beijing was not financed and we’ve struggled in the last 25 years to implement it,” she said. But there have been concerns over how the money will be spent. Hakima Abbas, co-executive director of the Association for Women’s Rights in Development, said: “We have no sense yet of where that money is going, or to who, or for what. “It’s really great that we are talking about billions being committed, especially because the resources were part of the problem of Beijing. There has not been political will or the financial backing to make the [Beijing] platform for action’s implementation possible.” She added: “The key drivers of change are feminist movements. If you don’t have strong feminist movements you’re not going to drive gender equality. If these billions go to private/public partnerships, that’s not going to be catalytic. You need to make sure the majority of the funding goes to feminist movements.” Some of the hundreds of activists recruited globally to ensure young people participated in discussions have also expressed frustrations. A young feminist manifesto, published earlier this year, said unequal power dynamics and disregarded opinions resulted in young people “finding it very difficult to participate in these spaces, not to mention to co-lead and co-own them”.",Women's rights and gender equality; Global development; World news; Gender; Life and style; United Nations; Inequality; Coronavirus; Unemployment; Poverty; Society; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Melinda French Gates; Women,Global development
2021-02-04T06:20:59Z,'Back empty-handed': Bangladeshis cut off from jobs abroad face rising poverty,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/feb/04/back-empty-handed-bangladeshis-cut-off-from-jobs-abroad-face-rising-poverty,"When the pandemic forced Firoza Begum back to Bangladesh after six months trapped in her employer’s house without pay, her husband was so angry she had returned empty-handed that he would not let her move back in to the family home. All her savings after 14 years working in the Middle East had been spent escaping her abusive employer. Begum, 40, had to go to her parents’ home, where she took on responsibility for her mother and two disabled sisters. For years, Bangladeshi migrant workers have supported their families back home and their remittances have been vital to keeping entire communities out of extreme poverty, as the government has tried to meet the UN’s 2030 sustainable development goals. But after hundreds of thousands of migrant workers lost their jobs because of Covid-19’s economic impact, government research suggests that they and their families are returning to the poverty they tried to escape. A year ago, Begum was earning 22,000 Bangladeshi taka (£190) each month working for a Saudi doctor, sending almost all of it to her husband or her parents, to repair houses, buy land and pay medical bills. “Now there is no income. I am having a hard time meeting our family’s monthly expenses,” she says. “We’re surviving by taking loans from my relatives. I owe them about 150,000 taka. I don’t know how this money will be repaid.” The government has encouraged work abroad. Remittances were worth $15bn (£11bn) a year and helped reduce poverty in rural areas, supporting families and financing small business. By last April however, remittances were at their lowest for a decade, according to the central bank, and the protracted crisis is pushing back Bangladesh’s progress on poverty. The World Food Programme has estimated that, globally, the drop in migrant workers’ remittances could put an additional 33 million people at risk of hunger. When the government reported to the UN on its progress against the sustainable development goals in June, it said that the poverty rate had halved from 40% in 2005 to 20.5% in 2019, but that the pandemic risked halting the main strategies of promoting work abroad and increasing employment opportunities for the poorest. By June 2020, the poverty rate had risen back to 29.5%. A survey by Bangladeshi research company Innovision said on average low-income families had enough to support themselves for eight days without extra income, while most households had grain stores that would last 11 days. Brac, Bangladesh’s largest NGO, created a database of 35,000 returnees to support them with cash grants and counselling. Shariful Islam, head of Brac’s migration programme, says there have been more than 400,000 returnees since early 2020 and most had no support. “People are coming back empty-handed who have lost their jobs. These people don’t know what will happen in the future.” Given how many people are supported by each migrant worker, he says, up to a third of the population could be affected by the job losses, and there are still many unemployed people stranded abroad. A survey in June by the UN’s migration agency (IOM) revealed that most of the returnees were now unemployed and half had no income at all. In Paschim Charbata, a village in the coastal Noakhali district, almost every home had sent a man abroad over the past decade but most are now back. They sit at home worrying about jobs, mounting debt and feeding their families. “The coronavirus pandemic has stopped my life. My life trajectory was at its peak but now it’s rapidly descending. The family was doing quite well. I could spend the money on what my family needed. Now it is very difficult to meet the daily expenses,” says Reaz Mahmud, 39. He has accumulated a debt of 600,000 taka (£5,200) – double the amount he borrowed when he first left Bangladesh in 2010 to work as an electrician in Qatar. His job as a private driver in Oman ended when the pandemic led to travel restrictions, trapping him in Bangladesh, where he had been taking a holiday for the first time in two years. Rezaul Karim Chowdhury, head of Bangladeshi NGO Coast, says the organisation will make migrant workers a priority by supporting them to reintegrate into society, or providing training so they can return to work abroad with better skills. “There are hardships because they are running out of savings, they are not in good condition and sometimes they are suffering trauma. If it continues it will create social unrest, so we are ready to support them,” says Chowdhury. Mahmud had to send his wife to her father’s house with their three children and sell most of his land. With so many people searching for jobs, finding work has proved impossible and he now faces selling the plot his family live on unless he can return to Oman. “Before the pandemic I was able to send money home every month and, from abroad, alleviated many of the crises at home. I thought I could make a living through this job, that I could improve my life,” says Mahmud. “Coronavirus shattered all dreams.” Sign up for the Global Dispatch newsletter – a fortnightly roundup of our top stories, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues:",Remittances; Global development; Bangladesh; South and central Asia; World news; Migration and development; Middle East and north Africa; Migration; Inequality; Poverty; Hunger; Coronavirus,Global development
2020-01-01T07:00:58Z,'Where I live even 100 people cannot raise the money for one funeral',https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/commentisfree/2020/jan/01/where-i-live-even-100-people-cannot-raise-the-money-for-one-funeral,"Where I live, people are organised in clans. I belong to a clan where even 100 people, gathered together, can’t raise $100 (£75) to organise a funeral. I come from a family that couldn’t afford to pay tuition of $10 a term when I was a student two decades ago. Many of my young relatives are out of school now, because their parents can’t afford a full academic term of $15. Others are even worse off. There are families I have spoken with who say they are unable to earn $2 a month as a family. There is no question that the UN global goals have stalled. And that’s bad news for people like me. I happen to be one of those people who are fixated on the end of extreme poverty, and – if things were to go to plan – the prospect of seeing the global goals come true by 2030. It is common for many small farmers in my region to own land that only measures 30ft by 100ft (or 0.07 acres). My own mum, who lives in a secluded village, only has half an acre. People’s incomes are defined not by real estate or industrial projects on their land, but by the crops they grow. I can’t imagine what will happen when the young generation grows up and divides that land into even smaller fragments, with many of them probably having attained no education and with no jobs available. It is why I feel strongly about how the global goals could change the course of life for people like us. When the millennium development goals were adopted, I was a young school dropout, and didn’t know what was happening in the world. My only friends at the time were the boda boda (motorcycle taxis) riders for whom I repaired flat tyres, in a dilapidated garage, in one of the slums of Uganda’s capital. The $0.10 that I earned for each flat tyre I repaired offered a liberation from the kind of poverty I had weathered since childhood. But an even bigger, unexpected opportunity appeared: I trained and became a teacher in 2003, thanks to my government’s introduction of free teacher training. By the time the global goals were adopted in 2015, a lot had happened in my life. I had taught maths and science in the classroom for seven years, until I quit to become a farmer in 2011. Although teaching itself didn’t lift me out of poverty – I struggled to get enough to eat throughout my teaching career – it prepared me to be an informed farmer. Today, I am the only rural poor farmer in my region, and certainly the only one in my clan, who is engaged with the global goals. So, with the ever-spiralling grip of poverty, I keep thinking that maybe something will come out of the goals, to change us for the better. I also feel the urge to do something for myself. I at least trained as a teacher, though this, too, left me poor. In contrast, many in my clan never went to school. So, if I can’t do anything to bring lasting change, things will only get worse once I am gone. But, in all this, what breaks my heart is that the current stalling on progress of the global goals means we might end up in the same place in 2030, with nothing new, unless something changes now. I am calling on the global community to get the goals back on track. It’s true that times have changed. But there is a lot we can do, especially if the rest of the world directly supports the extreme poor, to help them create lasting, sustainable change. In my region, for instance, the inability of rural farmers to access markets for their produce is the reason they are poor. Farmers need infrastructure to create jobs, and support to get connected to agri companies so they can sell their produce. That way they can tread their own path from poverty. • Anthony Kalulu is a farmer in eastern Uganda, and founder of non-profit Uganda Community Farm (UCF)",Global development; Uganda; Africa; World news; Poverty; Sustainable development goals,Global development
2021-02-03T06:30:51Z,Rishi Sunak is paying Covid bills off the backs of the poor. It shames our country | Gordon Brown,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/commentisfree/2021/feb/03/rishi-sunak-is-paying-covid-bills-off-the-backs-of-the-poor-it-shames-our-country,"Nothing shames our country more than Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, paying the bills for Covid off the backs of the poor – at home and abroad. He has recently been pushed off his plan to cut £20 a week from the already low universal credit paid to 6 million of Britain’s poorest families. But the world’s poor, thousands of miles away, cannot defend themselves from the chancellor’s assault, and never in our history has the overseas aid budget been cut so peremptorily, so savagely and by so much. At the end of March, the 30%, £5bn reduction from the 2019 aid budget total will be so severe that it is in breach of UK law, and current legislation will have to be repealed for it to be implemented. And we have to ask: what moral compass guides ministers towards severing lifelines of support in the midst of the most devastating peacetime humanitarian emergency in a century? For 20 years until now, the UK aid budget has risen, and global poverty has fallen. Now, for the first time in two decades, global poverty is rising but development aid, sadly, is falling. We are depriving the world’s most vulnerable of food, medical treatment and schooling, as surely as pulling away the needle from a child awaiting vaccination, whipping away the school meal from her hungry mouth and shutting the school gates on all those whose human right to education we promised to uphold. It will take decades to undo the damage that is about to be inflicted. More than 5 million young people will be denied the vaccinations for polio, measles and others they require, with the result that, according to a calculation by the Center for Global Development, 100,000 children’s lives that could have been saved will be lost. Four and a half million fewer children a year will receive an education. “Global Britain” is being launched by telling 27 of the poorest countries in Asia and Africa that, at a stroke, their bilateral aid is being almost halved, and that Britain’s share of national income devoted to overseas development – once one of the highest at 0.7% – will fall to 0.5 %, below that of Saudi Arabia and Turkey. And when Boris Johnson arrives in Glasgow to chair November’s Cop26 climate change conference, he will have to explain why Britain’s contribution to solving what he says is the greatest existential problem facing the world is also about to be cut back. The government’s actions are as shortsighted as they are unprincipled. Covid cannot be finally and certainly eliminated anywhere if it is not eliminated everywhere. Given the risk that the virus mutates abroad and returns to ravage even those who have been vaccinated, it would be value for money for rich countries like Britain, that are losing trillions in economic output, to agree to share the burden of financing the vaccination of all the people of all the poorest countries. The scale of the human tragedies and lives lost not just from Covid but from the consequent hunger and destitution should focus our minds. The great reversal in progress is happening at the very moment when the world’s poorest need our help most. Yesterday, the broadest possible coalition, from the Women’s Institute and Save the Children to the National Union of Students and the Wildlife Trusts, called for a renewed commitment to the 0.7% share of national income aid target and even if MPs vote to do so on urgent humanitarian grounds only – to deal with today’s emergency – the House of Commons should this month defy the government and defeat its plans. As chair of this year’s G7, Britain should not be cutting aid but rounding up worldwide support for an urgently needed new global growth and development plan. At the heart of it should be a Marshall-style plan for Africa. To halt the rising tide of poverty there, we should push for an issue of what are called special drawing rights – $1.2tn (£0.9tn) of new international money – and allocate it to poverty-stricken countries. We should instruct another trillion in resources to be made available to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund and implement a far more generous debt relief and restructuring programme. And if there is to be substance to the Johnson promise of 12 years’ education for girls, he should ask June’s G7 to fund a back-to-school plan that includes school meal provision for all undernourished children. For two decades and more, NGOs have worked closely with the UK government and, indeed, managed the implementation of many development programmes. The understanding was that both the government and NGOs would be ramping up efforts year by year to deliver the UN sustainable development goals. Standing side by side in campaigns such as Make Poverty History, the NGOs and the UK government would together lead the world, and the combination of our grassroots and intergovernmental pressure would persuade other countries to follow. A great deal was achieved over 20 years – $200bn of debt relief, a doubling of aid to Africa, new global health funds, which massively reduced infant and maternal mortality, and more recently, to Britain’s credit, the replenishment of the global vaccination facility and a new target to cut carbon emissions. But now that the UK government is reneging on its financial commitments to deliver on the sustainable development goals, NGOs will have to think again. It is right to be campaigners alongside governments when they are doing the right things, but it is right also to campaign to change the minds of governments when they are getting it wrong. And as we confront not just a threat to Britain’s standing as a global leader but also an urgent moral issue, this is preeminently the time to hear and heed the warning first issued by President John Kennedy that in the end “if a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich”.

2021-07-08T15:22:04Z,Edward Mortimer obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/08/edward-mortimer-obituary,"In 1998 Edward Mortimer, who has died aged 77, joined the staff of the UN secretary general Kofi Annan as chief speechwriter and later director of communications. Since the UN’s foundation at the end of the second world war, its leadership had often lacked breadth and depth of vision, with the exception of the eight years under the Swede Dag Hammarskjöld until his death in a plane crash in Africa in 1961. Like him, Annan, who was from Ghana, believed that the UN represented more than the sum of its member states, and could act as a prime mover in undertaking initiatives. Now, once more, the words of the secretary general mattered, moved, provoked and were remembered, and Mortimer had a key role in making that happen. On taking up his post in 1997, Annan set about organisational reforms, and then he needed support in expressing his instinctive humanity with clarity and candour. Mortimer understood how to combine substance and rhetoric with a human touch, drawing on his two decades’ experience as a columnist for the Financial Times and the Times. Annan and Mortimer’s time at the UN saw a whitewater rafting journey of highs and lows. These included the drafting of the millennium development goals, the blueprint for the early 21st century that preceded the current sustainable development goals; the creation of the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and Annan’s successful negotiations with pharmaceutical firms to provide affordable HIV/Aids drugs to the global south; the Iraq war – whose legality Annan publicly doubted in 2004 – and the bombing of the UN mission in Baghdad; and the oil-for-food scandal, which became so politically weaponised by the George W Bush administration that it almost cut short Annan’s second term. On the last of these, Mortimer was one of the first to sense the danger, and set about marshalling the arguments and mounting a defence strategy. He had the endless curiosity to get to the bottom of the most tangled problems, and the intellectual rigour to put these into language that was both logical and honest, yet politically acceptable – the greatest challenge for anyone seeking to communicate their way through the maze of the UN’s 193 member states. Annan paid attention to highbrow columnists, especially British ones, and was confident and perceptive enough to surround himself with talented people whom he admired. Before Mortimer was hired, some in Annan’s entourage feared that he was overly cerebral, too much of a lone star to fit into the team and would grow restless in the UN bureaucracy. So other, duller, avenues were explored for six months, but Annan stuck to his initial judgment and declared shortly before Mortimer’s arrival: “We’re going to show him a good time.” That came within a month, on a happy official visit to Portugal, and the working relationship was established. Having moved from Fleet Street to Annan’s administration myself a year before Mortimer, I was glad to see him thrive, and eventually to serve as his deputy until the end of his tenure. He and his wife, Wiz (Elizabeth, nee Zanetti), an artist, whom he had married in 1968, were warm and witty hosts. Mortimer championed minority rights, including those of Roma and Tamils, tirelessly lobbying and organising. He was a regular churchgoer and a genuine public intellectual – at more than 6ft tall, literally a towering one. In the light of the misgivings with which that latter role is sometimes regarded in Britain, he benefited from finding an opportunity overseas. There were more such figures in public administration in the post-second world war era, but few in the new century, and fewer still who functioned at a global level. Born in Burford, Oxfordshire, Edward was the son of Mary (nee Walker) and Robert Mortimer, at the time professor of theology at Oxford and later bishop of Exeter. Edward went to Eton, taught English in a school in Senegal for a year and gained a first in history (1965) at Balliol College, Oxford. After a US road trip with his friend Chris Patten, he won a fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford. It lasted until 1972, and within that period he reported from Paris for the Times. His time there (1967-70) included the events of May 1968, and his book France and the Africans, 1944-60 (1969) advanced his lifelong interest in Europe’s relationships with its neighbours. He went on to become a foreign specialist and leader writer with the Times (1973-85) and produced the book Faith and Power: The Politics of Islam (1982). Joining the Financial Times as foreign affairs editor in 1987 gave him a column in which he could find his full global voice. While his predecessors had focused largely on the cold war, Mortimer wrote about Islam, the Kurds and Europe’s cultural fault lines. At the end of Annan’s term in 2006 Mortimer went on to lead programmes at the Salzburg Global Seminar in Austria, “to challenge current and future leaders to shape a better world”. Colleagues there recalled how profoundly he believed in public reasoning – the thread through his career – and was worried about the ways he saw it being diminished. He appreciated having had the opportunity to help implement UN policy, drafting this farewell thought for Annan’s final UN general assembly speech: “Together we have pushed some big rocks to the top of the mountain, even if others have slipped from our grasp and rolled back. But this mountain with its bracing winds and global views is the best place on earth to be.” Appointed CMG in 2010, Mortimer left Salzburg for Burford in 2012, and the following year was made a distinguished fellow of Balliol. He is survived by his wife, their four children, Horatio, Matthew, Frances and Phoebe, and seven grandchildren. • Edward Mortimer, writer, UN official and scholar, born 22 December 1943; died 18 June 2021",United Nations; Kofi Annan; World news; Iraq; Middle East and north Africa; The Times; Financial Times; Newspapers; Media,World news
2021-09-23T10:30:45Z,‘Corporate colonization’: small producers boycott UN food summit,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/23/small-producers-boycott-un-food-summit-corporate-interests,"Hundreds of civil society groups, academics and social movements are boycotting the first UN global food summit amid growing anger that the agenda has been hijacked by an opaque web of corporate interests. Called the people’s summit by UN organisers, groups representing thousands of small-scale farmers and Indigenous communities, which produce 70% of the world’s food through sustainable agriculture, are among those to withdraw from Thursday’s event saying their knowledge and experience has been ignored. The declaration, signed by about 600 groups and individuals, states: “[We] reject the ongoing corporate colonization of food systems and food governance under the facade of the United Nations Food Systems Summit … The struggle for sustainable, just and healthy food systems cannot be unhooked from the realities of the peoples whose rights, knowledge and livelihoods have gone unrecognized and disrespected.” Some have criticized the prominence of corporations, such as Nestlé, Tyson and Bayer, in the summit’s efforts to identify food system solutions. About 90 world leaders are expected to attend the summit in New York, with at least 130 countries making pledges on issues like free school meals, reducing food waste, healthy eating, biodata and carbon capture. The summit, which has taken two years and millions of dollars to organise, was convened ostensibly to garner political commitment to help deliver the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) amid growing public criticism of the food industry’s contribution to hunger, malnutrition and obesity, as well as environmental destruction, biodiversity loss and climate chaos. It was billed as a landmark initiative in which the UN would act as the broker gathering views from a wide range of experts – academics, NGOs, philanthropic donors, farmers, community and Indigenous groups, corporations and business associations – to generate sustainable and equitable solutions. Yet critics say the role and responsibility of transnational corporations – which dominate every part of the food system, from seeds and pesticides to slaughterhouses, breweries and supermarkets – has not been adequately addressed. Nor have human rights or the pandemic, despite the fact it led to a huge rise in global food insecurity and exposed severe vulnerabilities in the global supply chain. “The audacity of the UN to keep calling this a people’s summit even as it continues to lose support is arrogant, [as is] pointing to my participation without listening to any of the substantive things I’ve said,” said Michael Fakhri, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food and adviser to the summit. Fakhri and those boycotting the summit say the UN has given the private sector a dominant role in almost every part of the summit, which will lead to transnational corporations and their allies in the non-profit and philanthropy sectors having greater scope to direct food policies, financing and governance. As a result, they say solutions will be market-led, piecemeal, voluntary and heavily weighted towards increasing food production through capital investments, big data and proprietary technologies. Critics say that this approach will enable a handful of corporations and individuals to expand control over the global food system to the further detriment of the vast majority of people and the planet. “The UN has provided a cover of legitimacy for corporations to capture the narrative and deflate public pressure – it has not been an honest broker,” said Sofia Monsalve, secretary general of the Food First Information and Action Network (FIAN), a research and advocacy organization based in Germany. “The refusal to discuss major issues like concentration in every part of the food system, corporate land grabs, taxation and accountability for human rights means the summit will fail,” Monsalve added. According to the special rapporteur Fakhri, it took months to persuade organizers to include human rights in discussions, and even then the right to food appears only in the margins. “We see the same corporate players who have caused irreparable damage to our health, climate and environment trying to create a new game, gain more influence and carve out new economic opportunities.” Agnes Kalibata, special envoy to the summit, vehemently rejected the criticisms. She told the Guardian that farmers, youth groups and academics have been represented in unprecedented numbers, and that those boycotting the event spoke for issues not people. “The summit is not about corporates [sic], it’s about working together to transform the food system and deliver on the SDGs, which are built on human rights … every country has engaged, people were invited and listened to,” she said. “If Michael Fakhri really disagreed, why did he stay?” But a new analysis published on the eve of the summit suggests non-corporate participants have been sidelined in favour of big corporations represented by and allied with business associations, non-profits and philanthropy groups. For instance, the summit is broken down into five areas known as action tracks. Those tasked with coming up with solutions to “boost nature positive production”(action track 3) include a single Indigenous group but 26 private sector corporations such as Nestlé, Tyson, Bayer and the International Fertilizer Association, according to the research commissioned by a global grassroots campaign opposing the corporate focus. Yet about 80% of the planet’s remaining biodiversity is located on the territories on Indigenous peoples, who have practised sustainable agriculture for millennia and who along with small-scale farmers are at the forefront in developing agroecology – sustainable modern farming practices that work with nature and communities rather than exploiting them. Nettie Wiebe from La Via Campesina, a global peasant movement representing small farmers, rural workers and Indigenous farmers, said her organisation withdrew and started organising against the summit because it was “deeply undemocratic, unaccountable and dismissive of those without wealth and power”. “The big ag solutions being promoted undermine what the vast majority of the world’s food producers are trying to do to protect the environment and cool down the climate so that there is hope for the future.” The analysis also found that influential business associations, thinktanks and philanthropies which represent, finance and promote corporate interests in sectors like agriculture, retail and finance, were given important leadership roles. According to the report, the World Economic Forum, a corporate-funded transnational organization of business, political, intellectual and civil society leaders (popularly known as Davos), has played a driving role in the summit while working to unlock trillions in new investments and infrastructure. So has the World Business Council on Sustainable Development – an international CEO-led coalition promoting the idea that corporations and wealthy elites can solve climate change and environmental degradation caused by extractivism. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a strong advocate of biotech-based solutions for food insecurity, is linked to several summit participants with corporate ties. It co-founded and helps fund the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (Agra), which promotes the spread of industrialized agriculture in the continent. The president of Agra, which has close ties to the agrochemical industry, is the summit’s special envoy, Kalibata. “This corporate juggernaut must be stopped, or we risk deepening environmental injustice and human rights violations,” said Kirtana Chandrasekaran, co-author of the report and food sovereignty programme coordinator at Friends of the Earth International. “Hiding behind their associations and business platforms, powerful corporate actors are directing policymaking, financing, narratives and science in the summit … agribusiness, fossil fuel and tech giants are promoting market-led false solutions that are designed to increase profits and tighten their stranglehold on food systems.” Kalibata denied that grassroots groups and poor countries have struggled to be heard and said the private sector was vital to solving the crises in the food system. “I want them to fix the problems they are causing – we need their help with solutions.” • This article was amended on 19 October 2021 to clarify the figure the World Economic Forum is trying to unlock in new investments and infrastructure, and to provide a source for the statement that it has “played a driving role in the summit”.",Global development; Food security; United Nations; Farming; World news,Environment

Writing in the Guardian, Brown said the planned cuts of 30% – £5bn – which come into force at the end of next month meant that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was “paying the bills for Covid off the backs of the poor – at home and abroad”. Brown’s intervention comes amid a chorus of increasingly dire forecasts, including from the World Bank, the International Labour Organisation and development experts, who have warned that two decades of progress in reducing extreme poverty have been moved into reverse. The elimination of poverty is one of the key sustainable development goals. The World Bank warned of a “truly unprecedented increase” in levels this year as it updated its prediction for the expected number of newly impoverished people to rise from 88-115 million to 119-124 million. Describing the return of extreme poverty after decades of sustained reduction as the “great reversal”, the former prime minister, who is a passionate campaigner on development issues, called for a new global growth and development plan. At its centre, he said, should be a $1.2tn “Marshall-style” plan for Africa as well urgent debt restructuring for the most impoverished countries. The Marshall plan was a US initiative to provide foreign aid to western Europe following the second world war. Saying that the cuts “shamed” Britain, Brown added: “Never in our history has the overseas aid budget been cut so peremptorily, so savagely and by so much.” Writing that it would take “decades to undo the damage that is about to be inflicted”, Brown continued: “[It] is so severe that it is in breach of UK law, and current legislation will have to be repealed for it to be implemented. “And we have to ask: what moral compass is it that guides government ministers towards severing lifelines of support in the midst of the most devastating peacetime humanitarian emergency in a century? “For 20 years until now, the UK aid budget has risen, and global poverty has fallen,” he added saying that the cuts would reduce Britain’s aid budget by share of national income to below that of Saudi Arabia and Turkey. “Now, for the first time in two decades, global poverty is rising but, sadly, development aid is falling. We are depriving the world’s most vulnerable of food, medical treatment, and schooling, as surely as pulling away the needle from a child awaiting vaccination, whipping away the school meal from her hungry mouth and shutting the school gates on all those whose human right to education we promised to uphold. “Over 5 million young people will be denied the vaccinations for polio, measles and others they require, with the result that, according to a calculation by the Centre for Global Development, 100,000 children’s lives that could have been saved will be lost. Four-and-a-half million fewer children a year will receive an education.”",Aid; Global development; Gordon Brown; Society; Politics; UK news,Global development
2021-06-09T09:59:34Z,‘On a rampage’: the African women fighting to end FGM,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jun/08/on-a-rampage-the-african-women-fighting-to-end-fgm,"It was when the phone started ringing with calls from worried mothers in Somalia that Ifrah Ahmed knew she was making an impact. The women told her their daughters had been bleeding for hours after undergoing female genital mutilation and asked what to do. Ahmed told them to seek medical attention, and probably saved lives by doing so. The mothers called because they had heard the story of a 10-year-old girl who had bled to death after being cut in central Galmudug state in July 2018. It was the first confirmed death in years in a country where any complications arising from FGM are generally denied and it gained worldwide attention. The death was first revealed by a local activist who had been trained by Ahmed’s foundation in how to use the media to publicise her work. Ahmed was herself cut as a child, and three years on from the girl’s death she, and many other activists, believe this grassroots approach is vital in helping to end a practice that causes immense emotional and physical harm, and often kills the victim. “Grassroots campaigners play a big role in lobbying the government, speaking on behalf of children and raising awareness of the risks of FGM within the community,” says Ahmed, who advises the Somali prime minister on gender issues. “If it weren’t for the local activist we trained who was based in the area, we wouldn’t know the reality of the death of the girl … I don’t want any other girls to die from bleeding.” Covid has placed millions more girls at risk of FGM as families have turned back to the practice during lockdowns. It has also resurfaced in countries, including Cameroon, where it had been largely abandoned. The procedure is performed for a number of reasons. In some communities it is a prerequisite for marriage; culture and religion are also used to justify it. The UN has set a target date of 2030 to end the practice. Mireille Tushiminina, head of the UN programme dedicated to eliminating FGM, has a huge task ahead of her and recognises the role grassroots campaigners must play. “For us to address FGM, it requires us to have a holistic approach and have interventions at different levels – global, regional and national,” she says. “FGM is a social norm and any intervention needs to be context-specific.” She cites as an example the ability of activists to speak local languages. Ahmed started the Ifrah Foundation, which aims to end FGM in the Horn of Africa, after she left Somalia to settle in Ireland. She has certainly seen the pandemic’s impact on FGM in Somalia, where an estimated 98% of females have undergone the practice – the highest level anywhere in the world. When schools were closed during Covid, cutters were going into homes to convince mothers that their daughters should be cut. In response, Ahmed’s foundation trained 80 women in settlements for internally displaced people and distributed radios to receive broadcasts of anti-FGM messaging. Over the past five years, her foundation has trained more than 5,000 university students, MPs, community groups and religious leaders to speak out against the practice, debunking myths around the idea that FGM is a requirement under Islamic law. Many campaigners use their personal stories of being cut in their activism, sharing testimonies that enable more powerful and impactful work. In Sierra Leone, Lucy-Ann Ganda, director of administration and human resources for the Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation, trains journalists in how to report on FGM and funds their work through the Global Media Campaign to End FGM, which grew out of an anti-FGM campaign started at the Guardian. She has a network of about 60 journalists based around the country. When Ganda was working as a reporter in 2006, FGM was a taboo subject and not spoken about publicly in Sierra Leone. Now the media landscape is changing. “We have weakened the silence,” she says. “Now people talk. The media is powerful – you are compelled to listen and you begin to understand and see [FGM] is not good.” Her team of journalists create programmes featuring medical doctors who use diagrams and visual aids to show people the damage that cutting can cause. Survivors of the practice also talk on TV about their experiences and the health problems they have experienced that stemmed from FGM. “We have succeeded largely in letting Sierra Leone know that this practice is not the best way to go because it has health implications, it has social implications, it has economic implications. We bring the reality out,” Ganda says. Between 2007 and 2019, the prevalence of FGM in Sierra Leone – as a proportion of women and girls who have been subjected to the practice – dropped from 98% to 86%, she said, adding that the next generation, who are more informed, are starting to rebel against parents who say they should be cut. “It’s a very serious issue here so that is why we are going on a rampage to let people know, so they don’t fall into the same trap as their elders.” There is still a long way to go. “We are up against quite a huge and broad mandate with the sustainable development goals being off track and we are underfunded,” argues Tushiminina. “At the moment, we have over 200 million girls [and women] who have undergone FGM. We are trying to prevent 68 million more from undergoing the practice. “Covid has given the opportunity to some perpetrators to go back and practise again,” she warns. “Unfortunately, that is the reality of gender-based violence increasing in a lot of countries.”",Women's rights and gender equality; Female genital mutilation (FGM); Global development; Africa; Sierra Leone; Somalia; World news; Women; Health; Society; Coronavirus; Life and style; Middle East and north Africa; Activism; United Nations; Campaigning journalism; Media,Global development
2022-01-13T10:31:41Z,"‘I started campaigning before I could even vote!’ Amika George on period poverty, politics and the power of protest",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/13/i-started-campaigning-before-i-could-even-vote-amika-george-on-period-poverty-politics-and-the-power-of-protest,"Amika George, 22, didn’t set out to be an activist. “None of my immediate family were involved in formal politics in any way,” she says. And yet, while still a teenager, she ran the successful Free Periods campaign that led to free sanitary products being placed in schools and now she has a book, Make It Happen, about how to get involved in politics from the grassroots. Featuring prominent voices from Arundhati Roy to the Egyptian writer and radical Wael Ghomin, its worldview is that there is an infinite possibility for change, situated in the hands of every one of us. In other words, it is a remix of Hannah Arendt with a sunnier chorus. So I am surprised when I speak to her, not just by her hinterland but by her manner. I was expecting a punchy, studs-first Marxist; instead I find a quietly spoken, very thoughtful committed Christian, who is constantly challenging, often playful but always with serious intent. George was just 17 when she read a headline on the BBC website: “Girls Too Poor to Buy Sanitary Products Missing School”. She had read an article about period poverty in India, and what now caught her eye was that one charity was diverting products that it had intended to send to Kenya to the UK. Students in the UK, it seemed, were facing the same problems as those in the developing world. That was 14 March, 2017; by April, she had set up Free Periods, to campaign against period poverty. She promoted her cause diligently: from the obvious (a petition on change.org) to the festive (a demonstration in Parliament Square just before Christmas 2017. “Even though everyone was protesting period poverty – something so horrendous – it was also a celebration of periods”, she says). A collaboration with the Red Box Project, founded around the same time with similar aims, led to a legal campaign against the UK government, urging it to comply with its obligations to “ensure equal access to education for all children, irrespective of their sex”. Two months after that, in January 2020, the Department for Education committed funding for free period products in all English schools (similar commitments had already been made in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). “Free Periods was successful,” she concludes simply. “That took two and a half years. I started my campaign before I could even vote, and I think that’s a testament to the fact that, actually, you can achieve change as somebody who is not represented in politics.” Were her parents (her mother works in financial services and her father is a project manager) surprised by her campaign? Only moderately; she had always been fiercely independent. Her school friends must, surely, have thought her single-mindedness extreme? “I don’t think so. Not unless they were saying that behind my back!” Just because the battle was won in such a short time, however, it doesn’t mean it was easy. The levers of democratic change started off remote and unresponsive. George recalls being at school, learning about the Houses of Parliament, then going off to a meeting in the Commons the same day, and “having a meeting with an MP who was quite resistant to listening”. It is an arduous life lesson, that parliamentary representatives don’t start paying attention until they absolutely have to. Then, there were flat, uneventful times when nothing seemed to work, and only social media was keeping her ambitions afloat (“floods of DMs and emails and tweets from people who were incredibly supportive”). George initially fell foul of other campaigners, too, changing the language she used after “I had conversations with trans men or nonbinary people who felt excluded.” But switching to “students” or “children” led to criticism from some feminists who insist the words “girl” and “woman” should not be discarded. On this, though, she is relaxed. “I didn’t have to reevaluate the aims of my campaign or what I was asking the government to do,” she says. “It just meant that I was making people feel included. What I find upsetting is that the people who were already included see that as an affront.” At the start of her campaign, she was shocked at just how horrible keyboard warriors could be. “I went to an all girls’ school: everybody was quite open in talking about periods, I hadn’t been touched by the stigma. It never occurred to me that people might not like any mention of periods. That there was this disgusting blame culture, either denying the existence of period poverty or saying: ‘The parents are clearly just spending all their money on cigarettes or alcohol.’” She says she turned that “dismissive attitude” into “campaigning energy”. which is an incredible, yet somehow believable, skill: she is aware of prejudice or bigotry, yet never sounds like she is taking it seriously. All the while, she was becoming a poster girl for youth activism, being named on the Time Most Influential Teens of 2018 list, the Big Issue Top 100 Changemakers and Teen Vogue’s 21 under 21 list. But, rather than basking in this celebration of her work, she questioned it. “On the news, you always see one face. On climate change, it’s always Greta Thunberg. I think she’s incredible, but I think it’s very indicative of how the media approaches young people and politics. They don’t see those two things as a natural fit, they have to pin it on one person. Suddenly it’s: ‘There’s this one teenager that actually understands politics.’ You’re heralded. As great as that can feel, it’s also really dangerous. If you have no experience in politics or activism, you think you have to be at that level of confidence or resource or privilege before you can be involved in the conversation.” Yet the plaudits kept coming. George was awarded the Goalkeepers Campaigners award from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and made connections and inroads at the UN. Then, last year, she became the youngest person to receive an MBE, while she was still at Cambridge. This, however, was a double-edged sword – since it was only when she started her history degree that she got to grips with the details of empire. Then she wasn’t sure she wanted to be a Member of its Order. (George was born in London; her grandparents moved to the UK from Kerala in the 1970s.) “Literally, I got to university before I even understood the true atrocities of what the British did in India, which is where a lot of my extended family still lives. Something like the Amritsar massacre, it should be British history, but I heard nothing about it. I was taught Henry VIII’s wives about six or seven times.” She accepted the MBE all the same, on pragmatic grounds; her campaign comes first, and the award opens doors. She had served enough time hitting brick walls. For her dissertation, George focused not on empire but on “British Asian teenagers in London in the 90s – how they wove their political identities into music and TV and clubbing; also how music was a really important tool in building up the anti-apartheid movement”. It is a bit bracing, to discover that people can now study the 90s as part of a history degree. But it is also quite typical of George’s approach: studious but always relevant, practical. She is taking a gap year, then wants to do a masters on Kerala, “the only democratically elected Marxist government in the world. I’m really interested in how that’s been sustained, particularly given that India’s national government is, obviously, so rightwing.” She is also keen that the university doesn’t rest on its laurels when it comes to diversity. “There’s a big conversation happening at universities like Cambridge around access, around the private and state school divide. But I don’t think people are differentiating between grammar and comprehensive schools. Grammar schools, schools like mine, are overrepresented, which is still replicating privilege. But to a person from a private school, they don’t differentiate. They just think: ‘They’re all free.’” In political terms, she is clear about where she doesn’t want to go next: formal politics. And she doesn’t want to start another, different campaign. Instead she wants to slot into something that already exists. Climate change is one focus, and part of her reason for writing Make It Happen was the strong sense of anxiety in her generation. “It feels like a completely insurmountable thing for one teenager to tackle. That’s why I talk about breaking it down to a community level, fitting it into a larger framework of issues, connecting with people who are working on similar things.” One criticism that vexes her is that is the claim that even the act of breaking poverty down into types – period poverty, fuel poverty, food poverty, child poverty – enables the discourse to step around poverty itself. “I find that dismissive, ridiculous,” she says. “When you have these micro campaigns, which are often asking for quite tangible actions, you get a lot of energy.” Personally, I’m a bit sceptical of things like this, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, which always seem to be extremely good at diagnosing effects – a lack of clean water or education – but deliberately bad at diagnosing causes, which usually track back to exploitation. George gives that pretty short shrift as well: “I met so many activists through the global goals, and got a huge amount of support from people within the UN, people within the campaigning worlds, who were tying up all these threads into a bigger blueprint for change. Period poverty sits at the intersection of gender, of education and of health.” She may orientate towards the possible, but that doesn’t mean she is not radical, or angry, or that she’s always optimistic. “Activism is important because you need to see success and when you look for success, it’s people doing things. You find your hope in people. But I hate to think that activism requires constant optimism.” She is pessimistic about the UK government, particularly the police bill moving through parliament. “I think it’s one of the most urgent issues in the country today. I don’t know if there’s the right level of awareness of just how damaging it is. Even going back to the Free Periods protest, that was the first time I got my head around just how many people wanted to give their support. Loads of MPs turned up as well. I realised I wasn’t alone, that it was actually a community effort. My mum wouldn’t have let me go if she thought I’d be arrested.” It is ironic, too, she says, that many recent protests have been against structural racism, and the legislation this government is trying to pass hands more powers to the police, an institution accused of so much structural racism (“People of colour, particularly black people, are so overrepresented in stop-and-search”). She considers quite carefully what kind of activist she is: certainly leftwing, definitely not trying to overthrow capitalism, or at least, not out loud. “I would say my views on gender, particularly,” and by this she means believing in gender equality, and LGBTQ+ inclusion, “would be considered extreme or radical, which is unfortunate. I don’t think they should be.” But, anyway, the shape of politics has changed, she says: activism doesn’t have to be all-consuming, you don’t have to identify as extreme. “Maybe it’s a generational difference,” she says, tactfully. She brings these entirely unfamiliar traits to the world of direct politics: tact and respectability. From a distance, it seems a little too polite to make change, up close it is admirable, a bit humbling. I wouldn’t say it was key to her success, though; I think she would have succeeded anyway.

2021-06-01T08:11:09Z,My story proves Rwanda’s lack of respect for good governance and human rights | Victoire Ingabire Umuhoza,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/commentisfree/2021/jun/01/my-story-proves-rwandas-lack-of-respect-for-good-governance-and-human-rights,"If Rwanda had hosted the Commonwealth heads of government meeting, which has been cancelled for the second time due to Covid-19, the UK was due to hand the country the Commonwealth chair. Rwanda would have held the responsibility for defending what the Commonwealth stands for – despite violating those same values for decades. When Rwanda was admitted as a member in 2009, I had hoped our government would apply Commonwealth values in its governance. But this did not happen. In January 2010, I made the decision to leave my family and career in the Netherlands and return to my beloved Rwanda. I intended to register my party, the United Democratic Forces of Rwanda (UDF-Inkingi), and to contest the 2010 presidential elections. But the Rwandan government does not tolerate dissenting voices. I was arrested and dragged into politically motivated judicial proceedings. After I was sentenced to eight years in jail by the high court, I appealed to the supreme court and the sentence was increased to 15 years. The African Court on Human and People’s Rights cleared me and held that Rwanda had violated my rights to freedom of expression as well as to adequate defence. After eight years’ imprisonment, I was released under presidential grace in 2018. I spent five years in solitary detention, during which time I wrote a book, Between 4 walls of the 1930 prison: memoirs of a Rwandan prisoner of conscience. In it, I recount the three years between announcing my presidential candidacy to my incarceration in the infamous “1930” maximum security prison. I dedicated my book primarily to all who are engaged in the struggle for democracy in Rwanda, with a special thought for the vice-president of the Democratic Green Party, André Kagwa Rwisereka, who was murdered in 2010 and the former head of intelligence, Patrick Karegeya, who was murdered in 2013. The more injustice that I and my fellow citizens have endured – including the killing of my close political aides – the more motivated I am to fight for democracy in Rwanda. On my release, I launched the political party Dalfa Umurinzi with a mission to strive for the rule of law and for sustainable development benefiting every Rwandan. Although the constitution provides me with the right to organise a general assembly, I’m not permitted to register my political party or be approved to operate. In 2019, I received an international award from the Association for Human Rights of Spain (APDHE). I couldn’t travel to Spain to collect the prize because I had no right to leave Rwanda without permission from the justice minister. Two requests to do so have received no response from the authorities. I have not seen my family in the Netherlands for more than 10 years. There is a pattern of limiting political participation to those affiliated to the ruling party and excluding serious contenders in Rwanda’s presidential elections. This is done by fabricating charges and abusing the judicial system. These acts represent a violation of Commonwealth core principles. They also challenge the claim often advanced by the ruling circle in Rwanda that the established political system is based on power-sharing consensus democracy with the intent of overcoming ethnic divisions and accelerating development. Rwanda’s oft-repeated development success story is flawed. In 2006, 72% of Rwanda’s debt was written off under the IMF and World Bank’s heavily indebted poor countries initiative, while Rwanda received more overseas development assistance than countries with similar incomes – a total of $17bn (£11bn) from 2000 to 2019. Despite this, Rwanda remains one of the world’s poorest countries, ranked 160th out of 189 countries in the UN Human Development Index of 2019. The government’s 2000 development agenda, which aimed to transform Rwanda into a middle-income economy by 2020, has not succeeded and delivery has been postponed to 2035. Although economic growth has been high in Rwanda, it is characterised by low per capita income, low private investment, low exports and high reliance on aid. Since 2012, Rwanda’s borrowing has intensified, increasing indebtedness to 66% of GDP in 2020. The main economic challenges include an undeveloped private sector, increasing unproductive indebtedness, high youth unemployment and a consistently high poverty rate, as well as a population happiness deficit. Rwanda’s alleged role in regional political tensions has also prevented economic development. Reconciliation policies, implemented after the civil war and the 1994 genocide, are not inclusive. They weaken the social capital that is needed for our population to trust each other and work together efficiently. The repression of dissenting voices has encouraged Rwanda’s citizens to abstain from participating in social, economic and political decisions. Prior to Covid-19, Rwanda had a cash gap of 15.7% of GDP a year to meet its sustainable development goals by 2030. This has increased to 21.3% of GDP per year. Given that its government was provided with significant financial assistance to support its development plan to transform Rwanda into a middle-income state over the past two decades, and has not succeeded, I would argue that any further financing must be accompanied by radical governance reforms. Current governance in Rwanda – that limits political space, lacks separation of power, impedes freedom of expression and represses critics of the government – cannot lead to sustainable development. I believe I made the right decision to return to Rwanda. My story, and those of others who have been harassed, jailed, forced into exile or worse for challenging the government, are tangible evidence of a lack of respect for human rights and of good governance, and are violations of the Commonwealth’s fundamental values. Governance reforms should be a prerequisite before Rwanda hosts the next Commonwealth heads of government meeting and takes over the chair. •Victoire Ingabire Umuhoza is president of the Dalfa Umurinzi political party, Rwanda",Global development; Rwanda; Governance; Africa; Human rights,Global development
2020-08-27T14:00:55Z,"Poorest countries face lost decade due to Covid-19, says IMF",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/27/imf-warns-poorest-countries-face-lost-decade-covid-19,"The shock waves from Covid-19 will lead to a lost decade for the world’s poorest countries unless they get concerted and urgent help, the International Monetary Fund has said. The Washington-based IMF said low-income developing countries (LIDCs) entered the pandemic in a vulnerable position and faced the prospect of their progress in poverty reduction over the past seven to 10 years being wiped out. In a blog, IMF economists called on the international community to adopt a seven-point plan so that poor countries could cope with Covid-19 and recover quickly. Growth, which averaged 5% in 2019, was likely to come to a standstill this year, the IMF said, adding that previous pandemics had left permanent scars. It backed a recent call from the World Bank president, David Malpass, for a more ambitious programme of debt relief that would move beyond repayment holidays to a reduction in the stock of debt. “LIDCs entered the Covid-19 crisis in an already vulnerable position – for example, half of them suffered high public debt levels,” the IMF said. “Since March, LIDCs have been hit by an exceptional confluence of external shocks: a sharp contraction in real exports, lower export prices, especially for oil, less capital and remittances inflows, and reduced tourism receipts. “Despite the best efforts of LIDC governments, lasting damage seems unavoidable in the absence of more international support. Long-term ‘scarring’ – the permanent loss of productive capacity – is a particularly worrisome prospect.” Scarring from past pandemics had included high death rates, worse health and education outcomes leading to weaker future earnings; a depletion in savings and assets that result in the closure of firms; and a legacy of debt that depressed lending to the private sector. The IMF said that in the aftermath of the 2013 Ebola outreak, Sierra Leone never recovered to its pre-crisis growth path. “Scarring would trigger severe setbacks to LIDCs’ development efforts, including undoing the gains in reducing poverty over the last seven to 10 years, and exacerbating inequality, including gender inequality,” the IMF said. The UN has set a number of ambitious sustainable development goals to be met by 2030, and the IMF said scarring would make these more difficult to achieve. The IMF has provided emergency financial help to 42 of the LIDCs during the coronavirus crisis but said more was needed. It said the priorities were: Guaranteeing essential health supplies, including cures and vaccines when they are discovered. Protecting critical supply chains, especially for food and medicines. Avoiding protectionism. Ensuring developing economies can finance critical spending through grants and concessional financing. Ensuring LIDCs’ international liquidity needs are met, which requires institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank to be resourced adequately. Reprofiling and restructuring debt to restore sustainability where needed, which, in many cases, could require more generous relief than offered by the G20 in the spring. Keeping sight of the UN’s 2030 sustainable development goals, including by reassessing needs when the crisis subsides. “The Covid-19 pandemic will be defeated only when it and its socioeconomic consequences are overcome everywhere. Urgent action by the international community can save lives and livelihoods in LIDCs,” the IMF said.",Coronavirus; International Monetary Fund (IMF); Economics; Global economy; Business; World news,World news
2020-04-01T04:05:11Z,'Big wake-up call': survey shows work remains on women's reproductive rights,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/01/a-big-wake-up-call-survey-shows-work-still-to-be-done-on-womens-sexual-rights,"Almost half of women and girls living in more than 50 countries around the world are not able to make their own decisions about their reproductive rights, with up to a quarter saying they are unable to say no to sex, a new survey has found. The findings, published by the UN population fund (UNFPA) on Wednesday, have been described as a “big wake-up call” in global efforts to achieve gender equality by 2030. Only 55% of women and girls in the 57 countries surveyed said they could make autonomous decisions about accessing healthcare, whether to use contraceptives and whether to have sex. Across regions, 76% of women surveyed in east and south-east Asia and 74% in Latin America and the Caribbean said they had autonomy over their sexual and reproductive health and rights, while in sub-Saharan Africa and central and southern Asia, the figures fell to 48% and 43% respectively. In Mali, Niger and Senegal, fewer than 10% of women said they could make decisions regarding their reproductive health. The figures showed that– overall – older, more educated women living in urban areas were more likely to be able to make their own decisions. The findings are based on demographic and health surveys conducted among girls and women aged 15 to 49 who were married or in a relationship. For the first time, the survey results have been used to help calculate progress towards achieving universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, which is a target in the UN sustainable development goals. UNFPA hopes to gather data from more countries in the future. “It’s a big wake-up call,” said Emilie Filmer-Wilson, UNFPA’s human rights adviser. “In UNFPA it’s opening doors to having discussions looking at what it is that we need to do more of, and better.” Filmer-Wilson said previous measures of women’s reproductive health and rights have tended to focus on the services available, rather than looking at whether women were able to access them. “We need to look at both sides of the coin. The demand and supply. The demand side is not being addressed as much as it should be, and we are seeing a risk of us going backwards.” The past few years have seen a rise in conservative movements and governments, across the world, including in the US, which are attempting to roll back women’s rights. The pushback largely centres on abortion laws, but has had a knock-on effect on other healthcare services. UNFPA also looked at how many countries had laws and policies that guarantee full and equal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare and education. Gathering data from 107 countries, which are home to 75% of the world’s population, researchers found that more than 90% had laws guaranteeing rights to maternity care, abortion, contraceptive services and voluntary access to HIV counselling and testing. But only 62% had laws or national policies making sex education mandatory in the school curriculum. Just 76% had laws ensuring access to post-abortion care, and 28% of countries where abortion was legal required a husband to consent to the procedure. Filmer-Wilson said the data marked an important “step forward” in accurately accessing women’s experiences. “We had a strong feeling that women were not empowered in this area [sexual and reproductive health and rights] but we’ve not had the data to back that up. Now we have.”",Reproductive rights; Sustainable development goals; Global development; Women's rights and gender equality; Reproductive rights; Society; World news,Global development
2021-05-27T11:04:54Z,The world is slowly waking up to Paul Kagame’s brutal actions in Rwanda | Michela Wrong,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/27/paul-kagame-rwanda-macron-french-president,"There are moments when the international community’s perception of a leader shifts into a new configuration, often for reasons that can’t be entirely logically explained. Myanmar’s Aung San Sui Kyi reached that tipping point during the Rohingya crisis, Ethiopia’s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, has been undergoing the same transition since war broke out in Tigray, and the same process is taking place with the Rwandan president, Paul Kagame. Today, he is welcoming the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to Kigali, his spotlessly tidy hillside capital. The visit marks the culmination of a bromance that has seen the French, once supporters of Kagame’s predecessor, Juvenal Habyarimana, make a public “mea culpa” for past support of a genocidal regime, and Kagame’s ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which did its best to eradicate French influence after seizing power, signal its interest in partnering up once again. If this cynical piece of match-making is a tribute to Kagame’s skill at identifying new sources of support whenever traditional allies appear to tire, it also signals his uneasy awareness of a turning point in international relations. A leader known for harbouring grudges is only laying out the red carpet for a European power, which once charged his inner circle with shooting down Habyarimana’s plane, because he feels he can no longer count on the United States, United Kingdom and other western countries whose aid has propped up his government since 1994. “Kagame’s star has definitely waned,” said French historian Gerard Prunier. “Ten years ago he was seen as a knight in shining armour, a wonder boy delivering development miracles. No longer.” One reason for that shift is an increasingly visible campaign of harassment, detention, torture and assassination waged by Kagame’s intelligence services for more than a decade, which has crushed freedom of speech at home and pushed dissent into exile. The fact that many of the regime’s targets have not been members of the Hutu majority but Kagame’s own Tutsi minority – many of them formerly trusted insiders at that – has not gone unremarked in the west. Despite his loyalists’ best efforts, it has become increasingly difficult to convincingly portray these “enemies of the state” as extremists bent on completing an unfinished mass extermination campaign. Two cases in particular helped shift the dial. One was the treatment meted out to the family of the Tutsi industrialist and RPF funder, Assinapol Rwigara, killed in a suspicious car accident in 2015. When his daughter Diane said she would run for the 2017 presidential elections, not only was she charged with forging registration papers – making it impossible for her to stand – but her mother was jailed. The family’s hotel was razed to the ground, its assets auctioned. The other was the 2020 death in detention of the gospel singer Kizito Mihigo. A Tutsi genocide survivor, Kizito was jailed after calling in his songs for Rwanda’s yearly commemoration of its dead to embrace Hutu victims of RPF killings – a taboo notion in Rwanda. Few Rwandans believe the official explanation that Kizito took his own life in his cell. Analysts say these episodes have done more damage to Rwanda’s image than the RPF’s role in the mass killings of Hutus who had fled into the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the late 1990s; its murder of former head of intelligence Patrick Karegeya, found strangled in a South African hotel in 2014; or its repeated attempts on the life of General Kayumba Nyamwasa, the exiled former head of the armed forces. “You can kill hundreds of thousands without it having much international impact, but jail an elderly mother, and it changes forever the way allies see you,” commented Prunier. If “Rwigara” and “Kizito” are hardly household names outside Rwanda, Paul Rusesabagina, the inspiration for the Hotel Rwanda film, is. His rendition from Texas last August was celebrated in Rwanda, with Kagame chortling on television that the operation that lured him on to a jet in Dubai and flew him to Kigali to face terrorism charges had been “flawless”. But in reputational terms, the operation may well have backfired. “A lot of US senators who only knew one thing about Rwanda – that this man was Africa’s Schindler – were left wondering what on earth was going on,” said one European diplomat. For years western development experts uneasily offset revelations of disappearances and extra-judicial killings in Rwanda against its stellar performance on GDP growth and the sustainable development goals. But that deal is looking increasingly wobbly as economists query the credibility of Rwanda’s figures. “The Faustian bargain Kagame struck with donors – ‘overlook my brutal behaviour and I’ll give you an African model for economic growth’ – has been exposed as a fantasy,” said former presidential adviser David Himbara from exile in Canada. The final ingredient in this recalibration has been Joe Biden’s election as US president. An administration whose policy on Africa was encapsulated by Trump’s crass “s***hole countries” comment has now been replaced by one signalling its seriousness on human rights. “That’s allowing old hands at the state department who have followed Rwanda for decades to get a hearing once again,” commented one European diplomat. “And they have plenty of concerns about Kagame.” In February, Rwandan officials attending the Universal Periodic Review in Geneva seemed taken aback by the bluntness of the human rights concerns aired by US and UK delegates. Kagame was not included among the five African presidents invited to Biden’s climate summit in April, and Rwanda was bypassed on Secretary of State Anthony Blinken’s virtual visit to Africa. A lot of this recalibration can be explained by the sheer passage of time. Kagame has now been at the helm for 27 years, and such longevity carries its own message. As one development official told me: “Anyone who is in power that long, well, you have to regard them as a dictator, don’t you?” Michela Wrong is the author of Do Not Disturb: The Story of a Political Murder and an African Regime Gone Bad",Rwanda; Paul Kagame; Africa; World news; Human rights,Opinion
2021-07-01T20:54:01Z,"Morning mail: GPs fume, Trump’s CFO charged, Australia last on climate",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jul/02/morning-mail-gps-fume-trumps-cfo-charged-australia-last-on-climate,"Good morning. The current Covid crisis is causing a mess for Australians in the country and those stuck overseas. GPs are continue to bear the brunt of conflicting AstraZeneca messages from the government, and a national cabinet meeting today may cut the number of international arrivals to try and contain the Delta variant. Meanwhile northern America is facing a different crisis as heatwaves cause hundreds of deaths and cripple infrastructure. General practitioners say they are being “left to hold the mess” created by the confused and conflicting statements from officials about the AstraZeneca vaccine. Dr Todd Cameron, a Melbourne-based GP, said it would be “an understatement to say there is a drop of confidence” in AstraZeneca following Scott Morrison’s “unhelpful” comments and shift on eligibility for under-40s. His clinic was delivering about 300 AstraZeneca doses each day during Victoria’s recent lockdown, but that has now fallen to between 40 to 80 doses. Those still coming for AstraZeneca now needed far longer, more complex conversations to ensure informed consent, he said. GP clinic owner Anna Davidson said it was a “full-time job keeping up with the state of flux”. A national cabinet meeting today will decide the fate of international arrivals. The premiers of Victoria and Queensland are calling for a dramatic reduction to the number of people allowed to travel to Australia, with the Queensland deputy premier using figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics to suggest too many non-Australians are travelling to the country. So how many people are travelling to Australia, and why? Is it “better to lock some people out than to lock everyone down?” Here’s what we know about travel to and from Australia since the pandemic started. The Trump Organization and its chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, have been charged with a “sweeping and audacious illegal payment scheme” of tax-related crimes, marking the first criminal charges against the former president’s company following a years-long investigation by New York prosecutors. Weisselberg, who has worked for the Trump family for nearly 50 years, has pleaded not guilty and his lawyers said he would “fight these charges in court”. Weisselberg surrendered to the authorities at the Manhattan criminal courthouse at 6.20am on Thursday and was charged by the Manhattan district attorney with failing to properly report company perks, including rent-free apartments, school fees and cars. While no charges were expected to be brought against Trump personally, they mark an extraordinary turning point and more are likely to follow. A devastating “heat dome” that has caused temperatures to rise to almost 50C in Canada has been linked to hundreds of deaths, melted power lines, buckled roads and sparked wildfires. Some 486 sudden deaths were reported over five days during British Columbia’s unprecedented heatwave. Climate scientists have warned nowhere is safe from the kind of extreme heat events and urged governments to dramatically ramp up their efforts to tackle the escalating climate emergency. Australia Australia has been ranked last for climate action out of nearly 200 countries in a report assessing progress towards global sustainable development goals. HIV transmission dropped 90% for men taking PrEP, an Australian study has found. The trial results show the drug could play a vital role in eliminating the virus, which infected more than 200 people in NSW last year. The Australian government is facing fresh calls to repatriate women and children from camps in north-east Syria, with top Red Cross officials warning time is running out “to prevent further distress and suffering” for the 60 Australians there. The world A long-awaited statue of Princess Diana was finally unveiled at Kensington Palace on Thursday by Prince William and Prince Harry, who reunited in tribute to their mother on what would have been her 60th birthday. But not everyone is impressed with the “awkward, lifeless statue”. Afghan civilians have taken up arms against the Taliban as foreign troops depart the region. Citizens have been forced to react to spiralling violence with militants seizing at least 50 of the country’s nearly 400 districts since May. Sexual assault advocates and survivors said Bill Cosby’s release from prison should be a “battle cry” amid concerns the decision could have a chilling effect on survivors seeking to hold their abusers accountable. New Covid cases in Europe rose 10% last week after falling for 10 straight weeks, and the WHO is warning of a possible new surge while calling for more monitoring of Euro 2020 matches. Recommended reads Bridie Jabour had just finished writing a book about what’s important when she almost lost everything important to her after a truck hit the car she was travelling in with her family. “There is an understandable impulse to imbue our life with meaning, and in particular for significant experiences to have meaning. So since we are supposed to learn something from these experiences, did I learn anything from brushing up against my own mortality?” After fleeing persecution in Myanmar, Jaivet Ealom was detained in a “torture camp” on Manus Island. Ealom’s book, Escape from Manus, tells the story of his journey. In particular, his six-month odyssey to flee the offshore detention centre using tricks he had learned from the TV series Prison Break, which involved, among other things, studying his guards’ movements and faking his identity. During a press conference signalling rising Covid-19 case numbers last week, a list of projects began percolating in Jennifer Macey’s mind. “Sewing is my hope and my balm for this lockdown. I’ve only been doing it for couple of years, but something happens after hours spent stitching, cutting fabric and puzzling over patterns – I feel calmer and happier … If crocheting and sewing is so good for our mood, why don’t doctors prescribe it? Well, some GPs already are.” Listen The merry consensus that guided national cabinet through most of the Covid-19 pandemic spectacularly snapped this week after the prime minister surprised state and territory leaders by announcing a change to AstraZeneca vaccine advice.

2021-02-07T16:00:14Z,"Until Africans get the Covid vaccinations they need, the whole world will suffer | Paul Kagame",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/07/africans-covid-vaccinations-pandemic-paul-kagame,"The current situation with regard to the access and distribution of Covid-19 vaccines vividly illustrates the decades-old contradictions of the world order. Rich and powerful nations have rushed to lock up supply of multiple vaccine candidates. Worse, some are hoarding vaccines – purchasing many times more doses than they need. This leaves African and other developing countries either far behind in the vaccine queue, or not in it at all. There are worrying signs of vaccine nationalism in Europe and North America. The pressures on political leaders to vaccinate all their citizens before sharing supplies with others is understandable. But forcing smaller or poorer countries to wait until everyone in the north has been catered for is shortsighted. Delaying access to vaccines for citizens of developing countries is ultimately many times more costly. The pandemic will rage on, crippling the global economy. New mutations may continue to emerge at a more rapid pace. The world risks reversing decades of human development gains and eclipsing the 2030 sustainable development goals. In this context, the billions of dollars it would cost to distribute vaccines across the developing world is not particularly high, given the return on the investment. Doing so would unlock global commerce, which would benefit all trading nations during the long road to economic recovery that lies ahead of us. We need global value chains to be fully operational again and to include everyone. Last year, the world came together to provide additional fiscal space for developing countries through the debt service suspension initiative at the G20. This helped governments in Africa pay for their Covid responses and provide additional social protection, thereby preventing the worst outcomes. We shouldn’t lose that spirit now and give in to an unfortunate erosion of global solidarity. The Covax facility, led by the World Health Organization, was supposed to ensure doses for 20% of Africa’s people – right from the start and at the same time as richer countries. However, nearly two months after the first vaccines have been administered, it is still not clear when African nations will be able to start immunising people, though the first doses may begin reaching the continent later this month. What can be done in practical terms? The rich world can help developing countries get the same fair prices that they have already negotiated for themselves. One pharmaceutical firm is reportedly planning to charge $37 per dose for “small orders”. Recently, one African country reported being asked to pay more than double the price that the European Union had negotiated for the same product. During natural disasters, price gouging for essential supplies is illegal. It should not be tolerated for vaccines during a pandemic either. If prices are fair, and Africa is allowed to place orders, many countries on the continent would be willing and able to pay for themselves. But, given the current market structure, they will need active support from more powerful countries to do so. The African Union and Afreximbank have set up the Africa Medical Supplies Platform to help countries secure financing by providing advance commitment guarantees of up to $2bn to manufacturers. The platform has negotiated an initial order of 270m doses, but this is still very far from the 60% coverage Africa needs to achieve some measure of herd immunity, and there is no telling when those supplies will be available. Vaccine candidates from China and Russia are also coming online and may provide an alternative for some developing countries. However, the reality is that most countries will only be able to procure vaccines that have been approved by the World Health Organization. The WHO should speed up emergency use approvals for Covid-19 vaccines in line with action taken by major national regulators in Europe and North America. Africa is not sitting back and waiting for charity. We have learned our lessons from the past. All we ask for is transparency and fairness in vaccine access, not the protectionism currently in play. Ensuring equitable access to vaccines globally during a pandemic is not only a moral issue, but an economic imperative to protect the wellbeing of people everywhere. But when will Africa get the protection it needs? If all lives are equal, why isn’t access to vaccines?

2020-12-13T19:25:56Z,British–Iranian academic sentenced to eight years in prison in Iran,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/13/british-iranian-academic-sentenced-to-eight-years-in-prison-in-iran,"A British-Iranian anthropologist has been sentenced to eight years in prison after being found guilty of collaborating with a hostile state. The Foreign Office has been made aware of the case of Kameel Ahmady, who said he was detained for 100 days last year without access to legal representation. Unusually, he has not been sent directly to jail following the sentencing. Amir Raesian, Ahmady’s lawyer, said: “[On] Saturday my client Kameel Ahmady, a researcher and anthropologist, was sentenced to eight years in prison by branch 15 of the revolutionary court in Tehran on charges of ‘collaborating with a hostile government’. We will appeal this ruling and we still hope.” In a statement released via friends in the UK, Ahmady said: “In autumn 2019, contrary to all legal strictures and hope of fair judgment, I was subjected to 100 days of detention and extrajudicial interrogation without access to a lawyer. “The judgment now handed down was issued after two non-expert court hearings in a legal process full of flaws.” Ahmady has published several books and papers in Iran on issues such as child labour, female genital mutilation and child marriage . He said he was being targeted for his work. “The legal focus of the accusation goes back to my research on the most harmful traditions about children in disadvantaged minority areas of Iran, but the main intention of my accusers has been to link my research to the United Nations 2030 sustainable development goals, and to stop my activities with the target community of my research,” Ahmady said. “My aim now is to appeal this verdict and hope for a fair trial in the appeal court.” His work and professionalism have been the subject of attacks on social media. Ahmady’s friends in the UK have been in regular contact with the Foreign Office and had been hoping he would not be given a lengthy sentence, so the news came as a particularly heavy blow. Rumours also circulated that a second British–Iranian citizen has been arrested and was being interrogated by the Revolutionary Guards. The Guardian has not been able to confirm the second arrest. Iran has summoned the envoys of Germany, the current holder of the EU’s rotating presidency, and of France over their criticism of the execution of an Iranian journalist, Iranian media reported. The foreign ministry in Tehran voiced Iran’s objections to criticism of the execution on Saturday of a dissident journalist, Ruhollah Zam, who had been based in Paris before he was captured in Iraq and taken to Iran. Zam was convicted of fomenting violence during anti-government protests in 2017. His AmadNews feed had more than 1.2 million followers. The EU said in a statement after his execution: “The European Union condemns this act in the strongest terms and recalls once again its irrevocable opposition to the use of capital punishment under any circumstances.” The French foreign ministry called the execution a “barbaric and unacceptable act”. Amnesty International and the press advocacy group Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also condemned the execution. Tehran claims Zam was not a journalist but an agitator seeking to stir unrest inside Iran.",Iran; UK news; Middle East and north Africa; World news,World news

In a letter addressed to the prime minister, they called on the UK government to view the crisis as an “opportunity” to tackle looming problems including inequality and the climate crisis. “It is clear that many aspects of our lives will never be the same again. Some industries may never recover from this crisis. We must use this challenging situation as an opportunity to work together with our global and national partners alike, to build a stronger and more resilient economy with the SDGs at its heart,” the letter said. The sustainable development goals, which were set by the UN in 2015, aim to achieve 17 core goals by 2030. They include eradicating poverty and hunger, achieving gender equality, protecting the oceans and taking urgent action to combat the climate crisis. The letter, which was coordinated by the UN Global Compact Network UK and UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development, said the UK should use the SDGs to promote plans for a more resilient economy, address regional and social inequalities and build “coherent policies” to help reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. “Covid-19 has exposed the depth of inequalities and risks exposing more families to income deprivation and its consequences … We need to ensure that our recovery from the pandemic leaves no one behind and puts the health and wellbeing of current and future generations first,” signatories said. “The pandemic has also highlighted the risks the world faces due to biodiversity and habitat loss, as well as the climate crisis,” the letter added. “We must balance social and economic needs with the needs of our planet, protecting and managing nature and reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.

2019-09-26T11:29:22Z,We've got a deadline to save people and planet – let's start the charge,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/sep/26/weve-got-a-deadline-to-save-people-and-planet-lets-start-the-charge-sustainable-development-goals,"We might seem a strange group to be writing this together – a British film-maker, a Libyan-Canadian doctor and women’s rights activist, and an indigenous leader from Chad – but what we have in common is that we are all appointed by the UN secretary general as advocates for the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Some won’t have heard of these global goals – 17 objectives to which every nation signed up in 2015 – but they form the basis of a masterplan to make us the first generation to end extreme poverty, the last to be threatened by climate change, and the most determined to end injustice and inequality. Hailed as ambitious when they were agreed in 2015, the goals nonetheless offered a new way to view the world, with no division between the developed and developing. Just one world tackling the most pressing challenges together. With only a decade to go till the 2030 deadline, we are in an alarming position where we are still not on track to achieving the goals. As the Amazon burns and the youth go on strike for climate change, we are reminded that the climate crisis is just one of many issues, and that our people are suffering too. Hunger is on the rise, and after prolonged decline, progress to halt diseases like malaria is stalling. Women and girls are still subjected to horrendous violence, while conflicts displace thousands of people every day. In all this, it cannot be ignored that the poorest and most vulnerable communities will experience the repercussions of the climate crisis the most keenly. We still have time, but it’s quickly running out: 2020 will be our last chance to get on track. This week at the UN, we have seen some promising signs from activists, civil society, and businesses willing to fight for people and planet. At five big summits on health, climate, finance, small island states and the global goals themselves, meaningful commitments have been made, including the launch of a decade of action for the SDGs. Over the next 10 years, citizens, organisations and businesses will campaign for global unity in the fight for people and planet. The moment the clock strikes midnight on the first day of 2020 they will be making noises in the media, online, in schools, in concerts, on advertising hoardings and in village squares and city streets to press for acceleration and achievement of the goals. This is a matter of urgency. The global goals cannot wait for the young girl being prepared for child marriage tomorrow. Nor can the mother choosing today whether to spend her money on food for all her children, or life-saving medicine for one sick child. Or the family deciding whether they must abandon everything tonight and become refugees. Across history, we’ve seen how movements accelerate and grow. From the anti-apartheid movement, to votes for women to the movements of today – Black Lives Matter, #MeToo, Fridays for Future. The movements of the past laid the foundations for the campaigns of today. The goals can provide a foundation and framework to hypercharge those campaigns and demands even further in the years ahead to bring us together to fight for progress. The sustainable development agenda is the only masterplan every world leader has signed up to. That the SDGs even exist is amazing. Governments are integrating the goals into their work, businesses and investors are embracing them as the best benchmark of progress, and kids are learning about them in school in 130 countries. Next year is our opportunity to push even further – to be louder and come together to demand more from our leaders. We’ve got a deadline and we’re determined to charge towards it and invite everyone to join us. As so many children reminded us last week; there is no Planet B and no Plan B.

2020-10-07T16:00:12Z,"Further 150m people face extreme poverty by 2022, warns World Bank",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/oct/07/further-150m-people-face-extreme-poverty-by-2022-world-bank-covid-19-climate-coronavirus,"An additional 150 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty by the end of next year as conflict, climate change and Covid-19 combine to end two decades of progress in raising the living standards of those on the lowest incomes, say the latest World Bank estimates. The Washington-based organisation said the proportion of the world’s population living on less than $1.90 a day was expected to rise from 9.1% to 9.4% during 2020, with the increase concentrated in countries with already high poverty rates. In the absence of the outbreak of coronavirus, the Bank said it would have expected the poverty rate to fall below 8% during 2020. A target of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030 has been set by the United Nations as one of its sustainable development goals but the World Bank, which lends to developing countries, said there was no chance of this being achieved without swift and significant action. In 10 years’ time, 7% of the world’s population could still be living on less than $1.90 a day, it added. Global extreme poverty fell by about one percentage point a year from 1990 to 2015 but the rate of progress had already slowed to half a percentage point a year between 2015 and 2017, before Covid-19 sent the process into reverse. The Bank’s biennial poverty and shared prosperity report estimated that during 2020 the number of people living on less than $1.90 a day would rise by between 88 million and 115 million. Depending on the severity of the economic contraction resulting from the virus, the number could reach 150 million by the end of next year. David Malpass, the World Bank’s president, said: “In order to reverse this serious setback to development progress and poverty reduction, countries will need to prepare for a different economy post-Covid, by allowing capital, labour, skills, and innovation to move into new businesses and sectors.” He stressed that Bank support would help developing countries resume growth and respond to the health, social, and economic effects of Covid-19 as they worked toward a “sustainable and inclusive recovery”. The report said early evidence suggested that the coronavirus crisis was poised to increase inequality in much of the world. The crisis threatened large human capital losses among people who were already disadvantaged, making it harder for countries to return to inclusive growth even after acute shocks receded, it added.",World Bank; Poverty; Coronavirus; Global economy; Climate crisis; Global development; Economics; Business; Environment; World news,Business
2021-02-22T06:00:23Z,The world faces a pandemic of human rights abuses in the wake of Covid-19 | António Guterres,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/feb/22/world-faces-pandemic-human-rights-abuses-covid-19-antonio-guterres,"From the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic almost one year ago, it was clear that our world faced far more than a public health emergency. The biggest international crisis in generations quickly morphed into an economic and social crisis. One year on, another stark fact is tragically evident: our world is facing a pandemic of human rights abuses. Covid-19 has deepened preexisting divides, vulnerabilities and inequalities, and opened up new fractures, including faultlines in human rights. The pandemic has revealed the interconnectedness of our human family – and of the full spectrum of human rights: civil, cultural, economic, political and social. When any one of these rights is under attack, others are at risk. The virus has thrived because poverty, discrimination, the destruction of our natural environment and other human rights failures have created enormous fragilities in our societies. The lives of hundreds of millions of families have been turned upside down – with lost jobs, crushing debt and steep falls in income. Frontline workers, people with disabilities, older people, women, girls and minorities have been especially hard hit. In a matter of months, progress on gender equality has been set back decades. Most essential frontline workers are women, and in many countries are often from racially and ethnically marginalised groups. Most of the increased burden of care in the home is taken on by women. Violence against women and girls in all forms has rocketed, from online abuse to domestic violence, trafficking, sexual exploitation and child marriage. Extreme poverty is rising for the first time in decades. Young people are struggling, out of school and often with limited access to technology. The latest moral outrage is the failure to ensure equity in vaccination efforts. Just 10 countries have administered more than 75% of all Covid-19 vaccines. Meanwhile, more than 130 countries have not received a single dose. If the virus is allowed to spread like wildfire in parts of the global south, it will mutate again and again. New variants could become more transmissible, more deadly and potentially threaten the effectiveness of current vaccines and diagnostics. This could prolong the pandemic significantly, enabling the virus to come back to plague the global north – and delay the world’s economic recovery. The virus is also infecting political and civil rights, and further shrinking civic space. Using the pandemic as a pretext, authorities in some countries have deployed heavy-handed security responses and emergency measures to crush dissent, criminalise basic freedoms, silence independent reporting and restrict the activities of nongovernmental organisations. Human rights defenders, journalists, lawyers, political activists – even medical professionals – have been detained, prosecuted and subjected to intimidation and surveillance for criticising government responses to the pandemic. Pandemic-related restrictions have been used to subvert electoral processes and weaken opposition voices. At times, access to life-saving Covid-19 information has been concealed while deadly misinformation has been amplified – even by those in power. Extremists – including white supremacists and neo-Nazis – have exploited the pandemic to boost their ranks through social polarisation and political and cultural manipulation. The pandemic has also made peace efforts more difficult, constraining the ability to conduct negotiations, exacerbating humanitarian needs and undermining progress on other conflict-related human rights challenges. Covid-19 has reinforced two fundamental truths about human rights. First, human rights violations harm us all. Second, human rights are universal and protect us all. An effective response to the pandemic must be based on solidarity and cooperation. Divisive approaches, authoritarianism and nationalism make no sense against a global threat. With the pandemic shining a spotlight on human rights, recovery provides an opportunity to generate momentum for transformation. To succeed, our approaches must have a human rights lens. The sustainable development goals – which are underpinned by human rights – provide the framework for more inclusive and sustainable economies and societies, including the imperative of healthcare for everyone. The recovery must also respect the rights of future generations, enhancing climate action to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and protecting biodiversity. My Call to Action for Human Rights spells out the central role of human rights in crisis response, gender equality, public participation, climate justice and sustainable development. This is not a time to neglect human rights; it is a time when, more than ever, human rights are needed to navigate this crisis in a way that will allow us to zero in on achieving inclusive and sustainable development and lasting peace. We are all in this together. The virus threatens everyone. Human rights uplift everyone. By respecting human rights in this time of crisis, we will build more effective and equitable solutions for the emergency of today and the recovery for tomorrow. I am convinced it is possible – if we are determined and work together.

2020-11-22T17:10:32Z,A terrible time for the UK to cut foreign aid | Letter,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/nov/22/a-terrible-time-for-the-uk-to-cut-foreign-aid,"News that the UK government is set to renege on its commitment to spending 0.7% of gross national income on foreign aid could not come at a worse time for the world’s poorest countries and people and for international cooperation more broadly (UK aid budget facing billions in cuts, 17 November). The World Bank estimates that the Covid-19 pandemic will push an extra 88-115 million people into extreme poverty this year alone, rolling back years of progress that UK aid has helped contribute to. While there is room for debate about the best way to set aid budgets, there are no grounds for breaking legal commitments or for turning our backs on countries and people at a time of great need. Taken together with the parallel proposals to boost spending on national defence and to restrict employment within the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office to British nationals – which will greatly limit the talent pool from which to recruit and undermine FCDO’s ability to operate effectively in different contexts – this latest move suggests Britain is rapidly becoming a parochial rather than progressive presence in the world. The UK, with its reputation as a global leader on foreign aid and for scientific excellence in vaccine development and beyond, remains well placed to play a leading role in both responding to the pandemic and helping to build a more equal, safer and sustainable global order. The Development Studies Association (DSA) urges the government to maintain the 0.7% commitment to aid spending, to playing a full role in supporting Covax (the vaccines pillar of the Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator) to ensure that developing countries do not suffer from vaccine nationalism, and to restating its commitment to the sustainable development goals.

2020-12-10T10:55:42Z,"Homelessness is rising, but it is neither inevitable nor unstoppable",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/dec/10/homelessness-rising-but-neither-inevitable-nor-unstoppable,"At least 150 million people are homeless, the UN estimates – more than the combined populations of the UK and France. Homeless people, in affluent and less affluent countries alike, describe being abandoned by governments on the one hand and overpoliced on the other. The US – the world’s wealthiest country – has more than half a million people living in homelessness, most of them African American. Almost half live in one of the wealthiest US states, California. The UK, with one of the world’s largest economies, has 280,000 homeless people in England alone. Homelessness at today’s scale has been decades in the making, even if it took a global pandemic to expose it as a possible death sentence. But there are also new opportunities to solve it. Homeless people want their governments to treat them like human beings, and to provide access to secure, decent housing, as they have committed to do under international human rights law and the sustainable development goals. To mark Human Rights Day today (10 December), 30 organisations from 20 different countries have launched Global Homelessness Action, collecting video testimonies from people living in homelessness, to claim their rights in their own words. From street corners, shelters, encampments and subway stations in every region of the world, people are demanding that their governments take urgent measures to eliminate homelessness. Governments are increasingly getting on board. The European parliament, for instance, has adopted a resolution underlining that access to housing is a fundamental human right for all people, and is calling for the EU and its member states to end homelessness by 2030. Similarly, a senator in Connecticut will be putting forward legislation in 2021 that recognises the human rights to housing as a precursor to ending homelessness, something the government of Canada also did a year ago. Legislating the right to housing is an important step, but only the first one. People living in homelessness in the midst of a pandemic need urgent, practical action, via programmes such as Housing First, which the European parliament has called on all member states to adopt as the primary response to homelessness. Housing First is based on the principle that everyone requires decent housing. It provides housing directly to people experiencing homeless with no preconditions. People do not need to be sober, employed or free of health challenges in order to access housing. Simply by virtue of being human, people who lack housing should be provided with it. Housing First is not a magic trick. It requires governments to make available a sufficient supply of truly affordable social housing. Temporary accommodation in shelters and hostels is justified only as an emergency measure, not a sustainable solution. In Finland, a national Housing First approach has contributed to the virtual elimination of street homelessness across the country, which is set to eliminate homelessness by 2027. Studies have demonstrated the considerable savings to governments when they choose to house people rather than maintain them in situations of homelessness. Housing First in Finland is part of a broader strategy to prevent homelessness by tackling some of its structural causes. Finland’s approach also recognises that homelessness is of national significance, and that it can be eliminated with political will and by recognising homeless people as ordinary members of society, with full human rights. In the words of George Orwell: “Either we all live in a decent world, or nobody does.” Leilani Farha is global director of The Shift and former UN special rapporteur on the right to housing (2014-2020).

2020-07-02T09:22:07Z,UK government development bank to end fossil fuel financing,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/02/uk-governments-development-bank-to-end-fossil-fuel-financing,"The UK government’s overseas development bank has bowed to calls to end fossil fuel financing abroad by promising to invest only in companies that align with the Paris climate agreement. The CDC Group revealed its new climate strategy, which will end support for the most polluting fossil fuel projects, including the production of oil and coal, and channel almost a third of its spending towards climate finance. The publicly owned investor, which supports job-creating sectors in Africa and south Asia, will end financing for coal mining, and oil and gas production, as well as new or existing power plants and refineries that use coal or heavy oil. The UK government is under growing pressure to end its support for overseas fossil fuel projects after campaigners revealed that more than £3bn in public money was used to support polluting projects abroad since the Paris climate agreement was signed. Environmental campaigners have accused ministers of “rank hypocrisy” for claiming a global lead in decarbonising the British economy while continuing to fund fossil fuel projects overseas. The Guardian has revealed that senior civil servants are in talks over a government-wide policy to curb foreign fossil fuel support before the UK hosts the UN climate talks next year. The decision to curb support follows an exodus of major institutional investors from the coal industry in recent years, including Goldman Sachs and Blackrock. Investors are wary of supporting industries that contribute to the climate crisis, and may risk the financial stability of their funds. Norway’s $1.19tn (£950bn) sovereign wealth fund, the largest in the world, has decided to reduce its exposure to oil and gas investments too, to guard against the risk of a quicker than expected global shift away from fossil fuels towards cleaner alternatives. The CDC’s new climate strategy will place “a climate lens” over every sector in which it invests to make sure companies are reducing emissions, according to the development bank. Nick O’Donohoe, the CDC’s chief executive, said: “Climate change remains the single largest challenge faced by the planet and is the defining issue for our generation and for those that will follow. That is why we have launched this ground-breaking climate change strategy that will shape every single investment decision we make moving forward.” The bank will allow only rare investments in gas power plants to support the UN’s sustainable development goals, and only in countries that can prove the project is aligned with a wider climate transition plan. This exception is likely to anger climate campaign groups, which would prefer a complete end to all fossil fuel support in favour of renewable energy investments. Others argue that the social and economic benefits of modest fossil fuel investments in areas with very limited energy access would outweigh the incremental increase in emissions they would produce. A recent report on energy in Africa by the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned that some new investment in gas-fired power generation would be needed alongside a surge in renewable energy - but the impact on global climate emissions would be negligible. Amal-Lee Amin, the CDC’s director of climate change, said: “Countries in Africa and south Asia are tackling the climate emergency alongside other urgent needs, most notably the need for economic growth, increased energy access and improved living standards to meet the needs of their citizens and to meet the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs).” “We will also invest in new opportunities and shape the markets that are needed to ensure the low carbon transition is socially just and that development pathways are resilient to existing and future climate risks and impacts.”",Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gas emissions; Global development; Environment; UK news; Business; Climate crisis; Energy; Energy industry,Environment
2020-10-14T16:42:30Z,World Bank and IMF must spearhead a green and inclusive recovery | Letter,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/oct/14/world-bank-and-imf-must-spearhead-a-green-and-inclusive-recovery,"The world is facing an unprecedented crisis. In just a few months, the Covid-19 pandemic has swept across the world, bringing human tragedy and causing an economic shock of historic proportions. While it poses a tremendous challenge to our economies and societies, the Covid crisis also gives us an opportunity to work towards a future that is more fair, equal and green. This week, the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund are holding their annual meetings. We will discuss our efforts to fight poverty and hunger, support socioeconomic recovery and respond to the emerging debt crisis. “Business as usual” is not an option. It is imperative that the World Bank’s development financing of $160bn for the coming year is directed towards a sustainable and inclusive future. This is the time to strengthen our economies in line with the sustainable development goals and the Paris climate agreement. We – ministers of the Netherlands, Denmark, France, Spain, Germany and Sweden, and the European commissioner for international partnerships – ask the World Bank and the IMF to deliver on: • Clear results on green and inclusive recovery. We need to ensure that the Covid response not only addresses short-term needs, but also fosters long-term resilience. We need to urgently phase out investments in coal, oil and gas, while redirecting funds to green jobs and access to renewable energy. We need to remove fossil fuel subsidies, while strengthening social safety nets. Climate and social criteria must be integrated in our economic stimulus packages. • A coherent approach to debt restructuring. We need to make sure we do not lose sight of green and inclusive reforms because of limited fiscal space and a looming debt crisis. Debt relief required to restore debt sustainability will allow for such fiscal space, necessary for future greener and more inclusive budgetary decisions. Debt sustainability, good governance and transparency are essential. • Addressing structural inequalities to strengthen local resilience. We need to empower women, youth and vulnerable groups to boost accountability. Our focus must be on inclusive digitalisation, inclusive employment and equal opportunities. Universal access to health and education must remain a priority. Clear choices will be need to be made in the coming months to deliver impact at scale while resources are running scarce. We expect the World Bank and IMF to choose “green and inclusive” as the way to go and to provide long-term assurance to investors that the transition to an inclusive and climate-smart economy will be sustained. The World Bank and IMF are global actors in policy development terms. They can lead the way towards more just and sustainable societies, as they have in the past. The pandemic requires this kind of leadership more than ever.

2021-03-14T09:30:28Z,Stylishly at home in Copenhagen,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/mar/14/stylishly-at-home-in-copenhagen-with-the-husband-and-wife-team-behind-ganni-label,"Couple candidness always makes for a refreshing interview, and husband-and-wife duo Ditte and Nicolaj Reffstrup are on hand to deliver over Google Hangouts from their home in Copenhagen. “I don’t know if it’s living with a person who literally drops her clothes from where she enters to where she ends up, so you can follow her path around the house, but I like to have cupboards where I can put things away – Ditte would rather leave it and see what happens,” muses Nicolaj. “But that’s exactly why people feel relaxed when they enter our home, Nicolaj – there’s actually stuff!” laughs Ditte. “I have a friend whose apartment feels like there’s nothing in it – I don’t know how she does it, it’s so American Psycho.” If Danish design is characterised by its democratic, down-to-earth and honest approach, then as our conversation shows, it’s little wonder that the Reffstrups have become the poster pair for it. They are the brains behind Ganni, the dormant cashmere label they bought in 2009 and transformed into one of Denmark’s most celebrated fashion houses. With Ditte, 43, as creative director and Nicolaj, 46, as CEO, they are the driving force behind the popular Scandi-girl aesthetic that has swept through the contemporary fashion industry in the past 10 years. Those patterned, puff-sleeved dresses that defined the 2010s; the pattern-clash, bias-cut skirts; the return of the “going-out top” and the ruffled blouses and big collars you’ve been seeing everywhere lately – all from the wardrobe of the Ganni Girl (the name originally given to coin the brand’s community of women, but which now is a byword for their aesthetic, whether it’s Ganni or not). It is a success story that has afforded the pair their dream home which we have all dialled in to talk about and which, after a year-and-a-half refurb, they moved into with their three children Betty Lou, 11, Jens Otto, eight, and Rita Sophie, three, in December 2019. Situated in Østerbro, the area originally developed in the mid-1800s to offer affordable housing and now famed for its rainbow-hued houses, the three-storey home is a departure from what they are used to. Until recently, the family had spent five years living with friends in a cooperative down the road. “He had two kids, we had three; we lived on the ground floor, he lived on the second floor and we all shared the first floor, so it was truly caring and sharing,” says Nicolaj. After deciding they wanted a garden, but intent on staying in the area, they knocked on every door in the neighbourhood and asked if anyone was willing to sell… and bingo. “Not just as a family but as a business we connect with the city centre of Copenhagen – we were also a little afraid that if we moved outside then we might succumb to suburbia.” When it came to restoring it, the pair had a clear idea of what they wanted, says Ditte, who loses herself in vintage World of Interiors magazines. This house was “a hippy cooperative” at one stage and so had “lots of little rooms housing a tea kitchen here and there”. Apart from minor restructuring and moving the entrance to the side of the house, much of the space is how they found it. “That was one of the principles we had moving into the house, that we wanted to stick to as many things as possible,” explains Nicolaj. “[When this house was built], the Danes had a real appreciation for things made locally, so for example, you wouldn’t cover up joint or woodwork because you were proud of the work that went into it.” True to their word, the top floor of the four-bedroom, two-bathroom house is exposed in all its glory. Despite the space feeling cosy and adhering to the couple’s insistence that they “did not want it to be a museum or an interiors design store”, this is a home that still allows special pieces to be celebrated for their form and function. A metal and leather hammock chair by Muller Van Severen sits facing a desk in the office made by Smile Plastics, the sustainable brand which transforms waste plastic into luxurious new surfaces. In the kitchen, the large family table is hugged by chairs Ditte has collected for years – . Particularly impressive is a Wegner chair she picked up for a few dollars 20 years ago. She had no idea who it was by until friend and HAY founder Rolf Hay turned it upside down to show her the stamp. In the living space a dusty-pink block-sculpture chair was sourced by their friend Tina Seidenfaden Busck from the Apartment interior store in Copenhagen. All around are mementoes from times they have collaborated with artists to furnish their stores – glass lampshades and doorknobs by Nina Norgaard and vases by Philadelphia-based ceramicist Jessica Hans. Like the conscious clothes they design, it’s a place you want to admire as well as actually spend time in. A “happy clash”, as they put it, of experimental and well executed, colourful and cosy. “Our house is a natural extension of what we do at Ganni and vice versa; or maybe Ganni is a natural extension of the house,” laughs Ditte. The personal attachment to the stories behind their furniture extends to their art. Take the photos of flowers in vases by their friend Casper Sejersen in the living room or the photograph of Laure Prouvost’s “nipple fountain” from her Free The Nipple project. “That is totally aligned with us as a family – we are all feminists at home – and also at Ganni,” says Nicolaj. “Gender equality is one of our core principles and one of the sustainable development goals we work with.” Ditte concurs: “There is always a link – we are not collectors per se, it’s all pretty random.” The pair were experimental about painting the exposed staircase that runs from the bottom to top of their home cornflower blue. “We had a lot of ‘should we, shouldn’t we?’, but in the end it’s more fun to take a chance than stay safe all the time, and we’re both happy we took that chance,” says Ditte. If the staircase was a decision that paid off, it proves a good analogy for the home the pair are growing into with their young family. “We lived in very small apartments for many years because I was an entrepreneur and I thought there’s enough risk in my life,” says Nicolaj. “We never owned a house or a car even until a few years ago. We just wanted to keep it simple – but it was chaos, at one point we had baba number two sleeping in a crib on the dining table!” he laughs. “Everything happens very organically and intuitive,” smiles Ditte. “It’s all heart driven.” ganni.com",Interiors; Fashion; Life and style; Homes; Copenhagen holidays,Life and style
2020-11-26T14:18:04Z,"More than 3 billion people affected by water shortages, data shows",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/26/more-than-3-billion-people-affected-by-water-shortages-data-shows,"Water shortages are now affecting more than 3 billion people around the world, as the amount of fresh water available for each person has plunged by a fifth over two decades, data has shown. About 1.5 billion people are suffering severe water scarcity or even drought, as a combination of climate breakdown, rising demand and poor management has made agriculture increasingly difficult across swathes of the globe. The UN warned on Thursday that billions of people would face hunger and widespread chronic food shortages as a result of failures to conserve water resources, and to tackle the climate crisis. Qu Dongyu, director-general of the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), said: “We must take very seriously both water scarcity (the imbalance between supply and demand for freshwater resources) and water shortages (reflected in inadequate rainfall patterns) for they are now the reality we all live with … Water shortages and scarcity in agriculture must be addressed immediately and boldly.” He said that the UN’s sustainable development goals, which include wiping out hunger and improving access to clean water, were still within reach but that much more needed to be done to improve farming practices around the world and to manage resources equitably. The organisation’s State of Food and Agriculture 2020 report found that 50 million people in sub-Saharan Africa live in areas where severe drought has catastrophic effects on cropland and pastureland once every three years. More than a 10th of the world’s rainfed cropland is subject to frequent drought, as is about 14% of the world’s pastureland. Rainfed agriculture represents 60% of global crop production, and 80% of land under cultivation, with the rest benefiting from irrigation. However, irrigation is no panacea: more than 60% of irrigated cropland around the world is highly water stressed. Irrigation of the wrong type can waste water, depleting non-renewable resources such as underground aquifers, and poor management can result in some farmers losing out on water resources – for instance, in the case of downstream farms, if rivers and waterways are run dry by upstream irrigation. Small-scale and farmer-led irrigation systems are often more efficient than large-scale projects, the report found. Large-scale state-funded schemes in Asia, for instance, have relied on tapping directly into groundwater, putting excessive pressure on that resource. But small-scale farmers around the world face extra difficulties, such as a lack of secure tenure over water rights, and little access to finance and credit. Separate research has recently shown that the world’s farmland is increasingly being concentrated in fewer hands, with large companies and international owners taking over swathes of production, while small farmers – whose farms are often run along more environmentally sustainable lines – are increasingly being pushed out. About 1% of the world’s farms operate 70% of the worlds’ farmland. Food production must change in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and try to stave off climate breakdown, but even this is not straightforward, the FAO warned. “As the world aims to shift to healthy diets – often composed of relatively water-intensive foods, such as legumes, nuts, poultry and dairy products – the sustainable use of water resources will be ever more crucial,” said Qu, former vice-minister of agriculture and rural affairs in China. “Rainfed agriculture provides the largest share of global food production. However, for it to continue to do so, we must improve how we manage water resources from limited rainfall.” This year’s FAO report focused on water, but much of the organisation’s work this year has been to try to stem the potential for the coronavirus pandemic to give rise to widespread food shortages. The organisation called on governments earlier this year to keep global supply chains and food markets open, despite the travel restrictions resulting from the pandemic, and these calls seem to have largely been heeded. The world’s harvests this year have generally been good, with some exceptions, but some areas of Africa are still under threat of severe food problems.",Water; Climate crisis; United Nations; Environment; World news; Drought,Environment
2020-09-15T05:00:18Z,'Covid has magnified every existing inequality' – Melinda Gates,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/sep/15/covid-has-magnified-every-existing-inequality-melinda-gates,"The world’s poorest countries risk a lost decade of development unless leaders move quickly to help them recover from the fallout of Covid-19, Melinda Gates told the Guardian. The co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has committed $350m (£270m) to support the global response to the pandemic, said it was in the hands of the global community to decide the long-term impact. “Ultimately, it’s our choice as a global community whether we face another lost decade or not. We know what can be done to restart vaccination campaigns. We know what it takes to maintain essential health services during a crisis. We know a lot about the kind of inclusive policies needed to help people withstand the economic shock. It comes down to a question of political will and working together beyond our own borders. Covid-19 doesn’t determine that. We do,” said Gates. Her comments come as the foundation launched its annual Goalkeepers report, which tracks progress against 18 indicators included in the UN sustainable development goals. Usually an upbeat look at efforts to end poverty and inequality, this year’s report, published on Tuesday, is stark in its appraisal. “In past editions of the Goalkeepers report … we have celebrated decades of historic progress in fighting poverty and disease,” read the introduction. “But we have to confront the current reality with candour: This progress has now stopped.” Highlighting the 7% increase in extreme poverty as a result of Covid-19, the report noted that disruptions to health services are affecting the prevention and treatment of HIV, malaria and tuberculosis, and could result in more women dying in childbirth. Immunisation rates have suffered a 25-year setback in just 25 weeks. Arguing for a fair distribution of any coronavirus vaccine, the report pointed to modelling by academics at Northeastern University, which suggested that if 50 wealthy countries bought up the first 2bn doses of a vaccine, rather than ensuring they are distributed proportionally to populations, almost twice as many people could die. “This pandemic has magnified every existing inequality in our society – like systemic racism, gender inequality, and poverty. And it’s impossible to pick one issue as more serious because so many people live at the intersection of all of those challenges,” said Gates. She said there was an urgent need for better data collection. A sex-disaggregated data tracker published last week showed that 75 out of 173 countries were not collecting separate data on Covid-19 for women and men. The pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on racial and ethnic minority communities, and people living in extreme poverty. Women are facing an increased burden from rising demands in total unpaid care work and experiencing the majority of job losses. In the US alone, the percentage of black and Latinx people who say they cannot pay their rent is twice the percentage of white people. “And there isn’t enough being done to disaggregate data by race, income and so many other critical markers that help us develop the kind of policies and programmes to reach people with the support they need,” said Gates. But she was optimistic that countries could bounce back quickly, “if we’re intentional about it, and if we put women at the centre of our response”. “And let’s remember, we’re not entirely unprepared. We have platforms in place that weren’t around in the 1980s and which can set us up for a quicker recovery.”",Global development; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Coronavirus; Sustainable development goals; World news; Science; Infectious diseases; Poverty,Global development
2020-10-19T23:01:47Z,"Climate finance driving poor countries deeper into debt, says Oxfam",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/oct/20/climate-finance-driving-poor-countries-deeper-into-debt-says-oxfam,"Billions of dollars are being loaned on high-interest terms to poor countries seeking help to cope with the impacts of climate breakdown, according to an Oxfam report. The loan terms risk storing up debt burdens lasting far into the future, the charity says. Poor countries are reported to have received about $60bn (£45bn) of climate finance from rich governments and publicly funded institutions in 2017-18, the latest year for which reliable data is available. Oxfam estimates that the amount that actually reached them was more like $19bn to $22.5bn when interest, repayments and other costs are subtracted. The world’s least developed countries received $3.2bn in loans in 2017-18 to help them with the costs of adapting to the ravages of the climate crisis, according to Oxfam, which analysed data from the UN and OECD. Tracy Carty, a senior climate change policy adviser at Oxfam, said: “We are concerned that poorer countries are being forced to take out loans to protect themselves from the excess emissions of rich countries. These are the countries that have done least to cause the climate crisis.” Climate finance is money in the form of grants, loans and other assistance from the rich world to developing countries to help them invest in ways to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and to help them adapt to extreme weather and other effects of global heating. Under international pacts stretching back to 2009, rich countries agreed that at least $100bn a year of climate finance should flow to the developing world by 2020. Delays in gathering data mean that judging whether that goal is met will take until about 2022, but estimates have shown that the target is broadly on track. There is no agreed definition of climate finance, however, and the $100bn-a-year goal can take in private-sector flows, such as company investments in renewable energy projects. There is also little way of judging whether these totals are outweighed by investments in high-carbon infrastructure, such as coal-fired power plants. Oxfam’s report, published on Tuesday, says 80%, or about $47bn, of all reported public climate finance was in the form of loans, not grants. Of this, about half ($24bn) was non-concessional, which means loans were offered on ungenerous terms. About a quarter of the total funding was devoted to improving countries’ resilience against climate-related problems, and about two-thirds went to helping cut emissions. About a fifth of the funding went to the world’s least developed countries, and only 3% went to the world’s small island developing states, which face inundation from rising sea levels and storm surges. Climate finance is likely to be a key issue at next year’s Cop26 climate summit, due to be hosted by the UK in Glasgow, where one of the discussions will be on article 9 of the Paris agreement, which covers how climate finance should be provided to poor countries. No new commitments to raise the $100bn-a-year target are expected before 2025, but poor countries are being asked to submit national plans for reducing emissions at Cop26, and in return they are likely to want assurances from the rich world that financial assistance will be available to help them to do so. Some campaigners have called for debt relief for developing nations to be discussed, in light of the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and the climate crisis. A spokesperson for the World Bank said: “The World Bank Group does provide concessionary loans to client countries at lower than market rate. These count towards our climate finance, as do grants. We do not count interest payments and other fees as climate finance, as they are considered the cost of accessing [development bank] financing, not the climate finance itself. Counting interest payments would give an inaccurate and inflated figure of the climate finance actually provided.” Rémy Rioux, the chief executive of the French Development Agency, said the $100bn-a-year investment flows were necessary but not sufficient to deal with the magnitude of the climate crisis, because global investment flows amounted to $20tn a year, most of which is not “green” or “climate-proofed”. The French government will hold a conference, called Finance in Common, next month to gather public development banks from around the world and call on them to incorporate climate finance into all of their spending. “We must ensure that all financial flows be aligned with the Paris agreement and the UN sustainable development goals, and not merely grants from the north to the south,” Rioux said. “That’s the magnitude of the investment flows that must become greener and more socially sustainable. And this global goal must primarily be translated into the domestic agendas.”",Climate finance; Climate crisis; Oxfam; Global development; Environment; World news,Global development
2020-07-23T15:29:21Z,"Covid-19 threatens access to abortions and contraceptives, experts warn",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jul/23/covid-19-threatens-access-to-abortions-and-contraceptives-experts-warn,"Rates of unplanned pregnancies have fallen around the world, according to new data published by health research organisation the Guttmacher Institute and the UN Human Reproduction Programme (HRP) on Wednesday. Global rates of unintended pregnancies have fallen from 79 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 49 in 1990 to 64 in 2019, thanks in part to a concerted effort to increase access to contraceptives, but there are concerns that decades of progress in reducing the numbers risk being undone by Covid-19, as lockdown restrictions hamper health services. Zara Ahmed, a senior policy manager at Guttmacher, warned : “Covid-19 could reverse those declines due to challenges with the supply chain, diversion of providers to the response and lack of access to health facilities during lockdown.” Ahmed said the pandemic was illuminating existing gaps in – and strains on – healthcare services, adding that some governments had already shifted resources away from basic sexual and reproductive services to Covid-19 responses. In April, Guttmacher predicted that just a 10% decline in services in poorer countries as a result of coronavirus restrictions could result in 15 million more unplanned pregnancies, 168,000 more newborn deaths, 28,000 more maternal deaths, and 3 million more unsafe abortions. Guttmacher and HRP’s latest research, published in Lancet Global Health, found that women in the poorest countries were nearly three times as likely to have an unplanned pregnancy as women in the wealthiest countries – 93 per 1,000 women in low-income countries compared with 34 in wealthy states. Europe and North America had the lowest number of unplanned pregnancies (35 per 1,000 women), while sub-Saharan Africa had the highest (91). Women in sub-Saharan Africa are among the least likely to have access to family planning. The research also revealed that 61% of unplanned pregnancies globally in 2015–19 resulted in an abortion, up from 51% in 1990. Despite a slight fall in abortion rates in the early 2000s, rates had increased over the past 15 years. Researchers said the trend could reflect increased access to abortion or “a stronger motivation to avoid unintended births”. The majority of terminations occurred in countries where abortion is banned or restricted, researchers found, which meant they were more likely to be conducted unsafely. At least 22,800 women are estimated to die from an unsafe abortion each year. Ahmed said even where it was legal some countries had deemed abortion not to be an essential service during the pandemic and had restricted services. “These service gaps could result in some individuals not being able to access abortion care at all, while others are forced to seek unsafe abortions,” she said. The World Health Organization estimates that 270 million women who want modern contraceptives have no access to them. Universal access to family planning is a target of the sustainable development goals. A study published in the Lancet last week said increased access to contraception is crucial if new global population forecasts are to be realised. Researchers forecast the global population will be 2 billion below current UN predictions by 2100 if women’s lives are improved.",Reproductive rights; Women's rights and gender equality; Global development; Contraception and family planning; Health; Society; World news; Abortion; Pregnancy; Family; Health & wellbeing; Women; Women's health,Global development
2021-02-03T07:15:52Z,Decades of progress on extreme poverty now in reverse due to Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/feb/03/decades-of-progress-on-extreme-poverty-now-in-reverse-due-to-covid,"Two decades of progress in the reduction of extreme poverty, the elimination of which is one of the sustainable development goals, have been pushed into a sharp reverse by a combination of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the growing climate emergency and increasing debt. With the World Bank warning of a “truly unprecedented increase” in levels of poverty this year, and renewing calls for debt forgiveness, experts are warning of a growing crisis in multiple areas from education to employment, likely to be felt for years to come. While the World Bank was already pessimistic, in January it updated its forecast for the expected number of newly impoverished people this year from between 88 and 115 million to the new range of between 119 and 124 million. Global poverty has seen a spectacular decline since the 1960s – when about 80% of the world’s population lived in extreme poverty. Today that number has been reduced to nearer 10%, with hundreds of millions of people removed from the extremes of hardship. But the numbers are forecast to rise in the coming year, and it has not only been in the category of those living below the poverty line of $1.90 (£1.30) a day that increases have been seen. Experts have noted a worrying rise in numbers of people living on less than $3.20 (£2.35) between June last year and January 2021. In recent months the growing crisis has been flagged up in multiple reports looking at indicators from the dropout rate in education in the developing world, to falling wages and rising unemployment, much of it driven by the pandemic, which has closed workplaces, schools and borders, and hammered the global economy. Among those issuing warnings has been the International Labour Organization (ILO), which said global workers lost $3.7tn in earnings during the pandemic. In its annual Global Wage report, issued late last year, the ILO reported that wages had fallen or were growing more slowly across the board in the first six months of 2020 and warned that the Covid-19 crisis was “likely to inflict massive downward pressure on wages in the near future”, with “women and low-paid workers disproportionately affected by the crisis”. The report warned that even in the one-third of countries where average wages appeared to have increased, “this was largely as a result of substantial numbers of lower-paid workers losing their jobs and therefore skewing the average”. But it has been the long-term and less visible effects that are concerning many, not least the impact on education. Among those voicing increasing concern is Axel van Trotsenburg, managing director of operations at the World Bank. “Our concern is that with this crisis we are seeing a reversal in the sustained reduction in extreme poverty and are now witnessing increases. The current estimates are an extra 150 million by the end of this year,” he said. “This is a crisis that has shown just how fragile this progress is, and how much of an effort will be required to rebuild, not least faced with the addition of existing challenges like climate change. “On top of that we are seeing increases in the other poor and unemployed outside of the definition of extreme poverty. It’s a clear sign that this crisis is already producing serious ripple effects. “You have 1 billion kids out of school, and online education not accessible to many children in developing countries. We have done a lot of analysis on this, but just an extra year of school enhances earnings to the degree that if you lose that school year, then the estimate through lifespan, globally, means you are looking at a reduction in world GDP of $10tn. “There is also a disproportionate number of girls who, when they leave school, will permanently quit education so will lose even more.” And while the pandemic has affected countries rich and poor, Van Trotsenburg believes that challenges facing poorer countries are more deep-seated. “One of the major challenges in developing countries is that the majority of employment is in the informal sector.” Andrew Shepherd and his colleagues at the Overseas Development Institute’s Chronic Poverty Advisory Network echo many of the observations of the World Bank and other global organisations. And as Shepherd’s organisation has pointed out, cuts to western aid budgets have further complicated the picture. “These budget cuts leave fewer resources available to tackle the longstanding challenges people have been facing, let alone the immediate struggles of daily subsistence and protection. In this context, the social and economic impacts of Covid-19 will continue to weigh heavily on low- and middle-income countries. And without adequate resources to tackle the overlap of poverty with climate change, conflict, crises of governance and uneven relationships with the global economy, these struggles will only be magnified.” Shepherd points to the risk of new impoverishment in middle-income countries where families have left poverty in recent memory and are vulnerable to sinking back into it. “One of the things that we have been seeing is the impoverishment of new groups who were not impoverished in the normal course of events.” While Shepherd points to the effects of educational dropout during the pandemic as leading to long-term impacts, some of the consequences are less predictable. “One aspect that came out of a recent study of returning migrants to Bangladesh from the Gulf [where they had lost their jobs], was that that their incomes had reduced to below other groups in labour markets, particularly in rural areas. “We had worked on the hypothesis that this group would be more resilient. And that has not been in the case. “The other big issue is in the urban informal sector in places such as Africa, people like market traders. With lots of markets closing, and the services dependent on them shutting down, that has meant a lot of loss of incomes.” Homi Kharas, a senior fellow for global economy and development at the Brookings Institution, is concerned that for many of the global new poor, the impact of the Covid crisis is likely to last well beyond 2030. In a paper last year, while arguing that some poverty “will be offset as economies start to recover in 2021”, he added that “the longer-term scenario suggests that half of the rise in poverty could be permanent. By 2030, the poverty numbers could still be higher than the baseline by 60 million people.” Speaking in January, Børge Brende, president of the World Economic Forum, highlighted another critical issue. “If we’re going to go into pre-Covid levels of global GDP, we will need to start investing in each other’s countries through foreign direct investment – that has gone down dramatically in the last year and a half.” He added: “We also know that the global value chains and trade are struggling to get back to their pre-Covid levels. And we know that trade has been an engine of growth, and has lifted millions of people out of extreme poverty in the last three decades.”",Global development; Poverty; Social exclusion; Coronavirus; Sustainable development goals; World news; Hunger; Education; Women's rights and gender equality,Global development
2020-07-11T05:00:03Z,Tom Hunt's recipe for zero-waste banana-skin chutney | Waste not,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jul/11/tom-hunt-zero-waste-banana-skin-chutney-recipe,"The Peruvian chef Palmiro Ocampo held up a string of candied banana skin and described how to make it: “Soak the banana peel in cold water for an hour, changing the water twice. Boil for five minutes from cold, cut into long strips and boil again in simple syrup until chewy, then serve twisted on top of banana bread.” Palmiro is co-founder of CCORI, a charity that teaches vulnerable women how to cook with zero waste. He is also a fellow member of the Chef’s Manifesto, a World Food Programme initiative set up to communicate the UN’s sustainable development goals to chefs around the world. Conor Spacey is another Chef’s Manifesto member who is passionate about zero waste. His businesses Food Space and Ink Cafe are living proof that even a restaurant chain can produce almost zero waste. “Chefs have an important role to play in fixing our food system,” Spacey says. “Sharing our work and experience with people at home can help reduce food waste.” Here is a zero-waste recipe that I’ve adapted from Spacey’s restaurant, while also taking inspiration from Ocampo’s candied banana skins. Banana-skin chutney This recipe was handed down to me by Northern Irish chef Conor Spacey, who makes it in his restaurants to reduce his waste; it’s fantastic served with grilled vegetables, cheese and barbecued meat. If you don’t have enough banana skins to hand, collect old skins in the fridge or freezer until you do. It’s super-spicy and exciting to see such a wonderful pot of chutney manifest from such a commonly discarded ingredient. As a member of the Chef’s Manifesto, I’ve helped co-produce and host their food sustainability podcast, on which we talk to different change makers from around the world, from chefs and leading academics to scientists and UN officials.

2020-09-28T17:30:09Z,"Australia joins US, China and Russia in refusing to sign leaders' pledge on biodiversity",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/29/australia-joins-us-china-and-russia-in-refusing-to-sign-leaders-pledge-on-biodiversity,"The Morrison government has said it refused to sign a global pledge endorsed by 64 countries committing them to reverse biodiversity loss because it was inconsistent with Australia’s policies. Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel, Justin Trudeau, Jacinda Ardern and Boris Johnson are among world leaders who signed the Leaders’ pledge for nature which was launched on Monday ahead of a major UN summit on biodiversity being hosted virtually from New York. The summit is working towards a Paris-style global agreement on nature. The federal government was invited to sign but refused because the 10-point plan calls for commitments that are inconsistent with Australian policy – including a greater ambition to reduce greenhouse gas pollution and reach net zero emissions by 2050. A spokesman for Morrison said: “Australia has already committed to a net zero emissions target by the second half of the century as set out in the Paris agreement.” “We will not agree to other targets unless we can tell the Australian people what they will cost to achieve and how we will achieve it,” he said. The spokesman said “we want to achieve net zero emissions as soon as possible” and pointed to the government’s recently released technology roadmap. Apart from Australia, other countries that didn’t sign the pledge include the United States, Brazil, China, Russia and India. The pledge warns humanity is in a state of “planetary emergency” due to the intertwined crises of biodiversity loss, ecosystem degradation and climate change. It states that the decline of the natural world is accelerating at an unprecedented rate. “Nature fundamentally underpins human health, wellbeing and prosperity,” the pledge states. “We need to appropriately value nature and the services it provides as we make decisions and recognise that the business case for biodiversity is compelling.” Australia was recently singled out for mammal extinction in a UN report that found the world had failed to meet a single target to slow the loss of the natural world and preserve land and marine ecosystems. The pledge promises a stronger global effort to reduce deforestation, halt unsustainable fishing practices, eliminate environmentally harmful subsidies and begin the transition to sustainable food production systems and a circular economy during the next decade. Leaders promised to ensure “biodiversity, climate and the environment as a whole” were at the heart of responses to the economic crisis brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. “Against the backdrop of Covid-19, which has crippled the world’s economies and pressured governments everywhere to begin the process of rebuilding and renewing, decisions made now will have ramifications for all of us and for generations to come,” the pledge states. Labor’s environment spokeswoman, Terri Butler, said the prime minister, Scott Morrison, should explain why Australia would not commit to a stronger effort to protect wildlife. “Australia is in the midst of an extinction crisis, 3 billion animals have died or were displaced by last summer’s bushfires and 12m hectares of land burnt . But the Morrison government doesn’t think we have a problem,” Butler said. The Greens environment spokeswoman, senator Sarah Hanson-Young, said a global target on extinction, similar to the Paris target, was necessary to stem the rapid loss of biodiversity. She said Australia was “squandering an opportunity” to take a leading role after the bushfire crisis, which accelerated the loss of habitat and wildlife and has forced the government to consider new threatened listings for iconic species, including the koala. “Our biodiversity is under significant threat and with it our tourism industry and local economy,” Hanson-Young said. “Australia’s lack of commitment at this summit is shameful and ultimately will be bad for our economy, as well as our environment.” Tim Beshara, federal policy director at the Wilderness Society, said world leaders who visited Australia were immediately introduced to a koala. “If prime minister Morrison isn’t willing to tell the world we are committed to ending species extinction in Australia, what level of extinction is he willing to tell Australians he is happy with?” he said. Sir Robert Watson, chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), described the pledge as “outstanding” and praised the links leaders had made between the destruction of the natural world and the sustainable development goals. But Watson cautioned what was possible without the signatures of major polluters. “Many of the most important countries in the world that are causing climate change due to their emissions of greenhouse gases, and/or are destroying their biodiversity, are not signatures to this pledge. Without countries such as the USA, Brazil, China, Russia, India, and Australia we cannot succeed in achieving the Paris climate goal or halting and ultimately reversing the loss of biodiversity,” he said.",Environment; Biodiversity; Australian politics; Scott Morrison; Australia news,Environment
2021-01-12T07:00:32Z,"Marvin Rees, mayor of Bristol: 'Symbolic acts should be linked to change'",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jan/12/marvin-rees-mayor-of-bristol-symbolic-acts-should-be-linked-to-change,"Back in June, a group of Black Lives Matter protesters toppled the statue of Edward Colston from its plinth in Bristol and threw it off a quayside where the slave trader’s ships used to dock. More than six months on, the mayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees, describes it as an “iconic moment”. But not a simple one. “I think we need to be careful with it,” said Rees. “The danger is that iconic moments of great symbolic value occupy the space that should be filled by substantial action. “Symbols are important but I didn’t get a memo on my desk the next day or the next week telling me racial equalities around mental health, school exclusions, criminal justice systems and educational outcomes had changed. It’s very important we make sure all symbolic acts are firmly attached to real change, real policy change,” he said. Rees mentions the Selma to Montgomery march of 1965, a key event in the US civil rights movement. “They didn’t just throw the die and see what came out of it. They wanted the Voting Rights Act to come out of it.” Rees argues that “policy outcomes” need to flow from moments such as the fall of the Colston statue. “Otherwise we just create disturbance without having a strategy and we lose control. That’s a challenge.” Rees, who was elected as mayor in 2016, argued that before the BLM protest, his administration had been working hard to make Bristol fairer for people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, ranging from setting up a commission on race equality to recruiting more magistrates from BAME communities. But Rees says the toppling of the statue brought more people into the discussion. “What has changed is the appetite for public conversations about race. That has become more urgent and more visible. People are being much more proactive asking people like myself and Asher Craig [a deputy mayor] what they can do.” Rees has also set up a history commission to study all the local memorials and places linked to the slave trade to inform a city-wide conversation on their future. It is a sensitive process. “There are many people who feel they are losing control of their city, their world. We have to have that conversation in a way that repairs relationships. That doesn’t mean moving at the pace of the slowest but it means taking people with you. “The commission is there to help us understand Bristol’s history in all its fullness … How we became the city we’ve become – who are the heroes, be they women, union organisers, abolitionists, black people, Asian people, gay people. “With that further understanding we’ll be in a better position to make decisions about who and what we want to celebrate. At the moment what’s clear is that we don’t have a shared understanding of Bristol’s story and the meaning of individuals within Bristol’s story.” In the days after the Colston statue fell, the headstone of an African man who was enslaved in the 18th century was vandalised. “It’s heartbreaking that a piece of Bristol’s history was smashed like that,” said Rees. Another tense moment came when hundreds of people gathered around the cenotaph in the city centre in an “All Lives Matter” demonstration. Rees sought out some of those who were at the cenotaph and discussed their fears. “One of the organisers said they felt like they were losing their city. I said they are, but they’re losing it to house prices and gentrification, not to migration. Houses used to be affordable, now they’re not. We have the worst affordability ratio among core cities. That’s what’s undermining people’s purchase in Bristol.” Rees says that “fragilities” within society were exposed at the time of the BLM protests. “We get on with life and every now and then something comes along that tests our relationships and they find us strong or wanting – and often somewhere in between. What we’ve had through Covid and Back Lives Matter are some real tests.” On balance, Rees believes the challenges the city faced have made it stronger, manifested in the number of people who have stepped forward to support the most needy. “I am hopeful. There’s an ancient truth – you get strong through challenge. The challenge is never fun at the time but that’s how you find your strength.” Rees argues the recovery after Covid will provide both opportunity and risk. “It’s very important we put the sustainable development goals at the heart of our plans for economic recovery. “One of my biggest fears is that in the midst of an economic depression [central] government will be so desperate they will have a values-free pursuit of economic growth. They will say, OK, environmentalism is great but we’ve got to get the numbers moving. And then they will try to retro-fit sustainability, ecology, inclusion on to the back of the economic machine. I think that would be a huge mistake. “Now is the time to rethink what the economy is so that by its very nature the way our economy works takes carbon out of the economy, drives inclusion, promotes life.” Cities and mayors can lead a new way of thinking, Rees believes. “We need to have cities shaping national and international policy. I think the voices of UK cities have to be equal partners at those top tables.” The Covid crisis has turned mayors such as Andy Burnham (Greater Manchester) and Andy Street (West Midlands) into national figures. Rees appears regularly on the same platforms as Burnham and also with the mayors of Los Angeles, Freetown and Montreal. “We are seeing more city networks and we’re seeing organisations like the UN starting to say that if we really want change we need to work through cities.” Rees says a string of US mayors have been praised for their work in the environment and immigration, despite having to work during Donald Trump’s presidency. “Their attitude is, it doesn’t matter what the president says, we’re still going to go along with the Paris agreement [on climate change]. It doesn’t matter what the president says, we are going to take care of our migrant populations.” Rees identifies as black and of mixed heritage, having been born in Bristol to a Jamaican father and white mother. As a boy growing up in a working class area of the city in the 70s and 80s, racism was common. He worked in the media and health sectors before entering politics through Operation Black Vote. “I grew up in challenging circumstances but there’s no point sitting in the corner lamenting how bad it is. You’ve got to get on with it.” The days and weeks after the statue toppled were busy for Rees as the world’s media asked him to explain the extraordinary moment. His term as mayor ends in 2021 and he plans to stand again. He accepts there is still much to do. “We’ve got to get affordable houses built in Bristol, get food out to people, tackle period poverty and school exclusions, decarbonise the economy.” The mayor ends with a scrap of philosophy from an unlikely source – the mixed martial fighter and boxer Conor McGregor: “‘I win or learn.” Rees says: “Even at times of trials we don’t want, we’re learning.”",Bristol; Black Lives Matter movement; Slavery; Heritage; Protest; Race; Culture; UK news,UK news
2021-01-08T08:00:32Z,'We didn't want our pensions invested in anything that was causing harm',https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/jan/08/pensions-green-current-accounts-to-savings,"Lots of people have started 2021 with the aim of making green lifestyle changes such as going vegan or giving up flying. But arguably the most powerful environmental changes you can make as an individual involve your finances, whether it’s the cash in your current account or the money you are saving for retirement. Research issued this week by the ethical bank Triodos found that almost 20 million Britons plan to do their bit to live a greener lifestyle this year. But it added: “Few recognise the impact that switching their finances to greener suppliers can have.” In part, that is because of the scale of the sums of money involved. For example, there is an estimated £3tn invested in UK pensions, and Richard Curtis’s Make My Money Matter campaign claims that moving your retirement savings to sustainable funds “can be 27 times as effective at reducing your carbon footprint than eating less meat, using public transport, reducing water use and flying less combined”. The good news for anyone who wants to make a difference is that there are lots of green and ethical options out there. Current accounts This is a good place to start for those looking to make a positive change. If you want to be sure your money isn’t financing fossil fuels or other controversial industries, you may want to consider moving to a bank such as Triodos, which “only lends to organisations that positively affect people’s lives, protect the planet or build strong communities”. The Triodos current account can be operated online and via an app, comes with an eco-friendly contactless debit Mastercard (it is made from a plastic substitute derived from renewable sources) and offers an overdraft of up to £2,000. But a stumbling block for some will be the £3 monthly account fee, or the fact that Triodos doesn’t have any high street branches. Triodos is highly rated by Ethical Consumer, an independent, not-for-profit co-operative that reviews companies and products. According to Ethical Consumer, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, NatWest, Santander and the TSB owner, Sabadell, are among the big names that continue to provide finance for, or invest in, fossil fuel companies. It adds that of the high street banks, the Co-operative Bank is the only one that has expressly prohibited support for fossil fuels. The Co-op Bank is famous for its customer-led ethical policy but some will be uneasy about the fact that it is majority-owned by a group of US hedge funds and fund managers. Some will favour a building society because they are owned by members, not shareholders, and have a strong tradition of helping people to buy their own home. Becky and Roy Francomb, aged 55 and 61 respectively, recently decided they wanted to move their bank accounts to somewhere more ethical. They were both with NatWest but were unhappy about its financial links with fossil fuel companies. They considered Triodos but ended up plumping for Nationwide building society because there is a branch in Seaford in East Sussex, where they live. Savings Much of the above also applies to savings accounts – however, you will find there is a lot more choice. There are dozens of building societies to pick between, including the Ecology, which has a focus on sustainable living, currently offers easy access, cash Isa and regular savings accounts paying 0.2%, 0.45% and 1.1% respectively. Meanwhile, Triodos has a range of accounts including a one-year fixed-rate savings bond paying 0.4% and a junior cash Isa (for those saving for a child) currently paying 1.5%. Charity Bank lends to charities and social enterprises and has notice accounts paying up to 0.5%, and fixed-rate bonds paying up to 0.75%. There are also scores of credit unions. To find ones that may suit you, go to findyourcreditunion.co.uk. NS&amp;I (aka National Savings) has been slashing rates lately but may still appeal to some because its mission is “providing cost-effective financing for government and the public good”. Pensions Campaigners argue that a good chunk of the money invested in UK pensions supports industries that are harming people and the planet. The Francombs recently worked with ethical financial advice firm the Path to transfer some of their pension cash from conventional funds to ones that align with the UN’s sustainable development goals. Becky, who has just taken early retirement from the NHS, where she worked as a project manager, is a member of Extinction Rebellion along with her husband. They have both taken part in a number of actions and have both been arrested. “As environmental activists, we didn’t want our pensions invested in anything that was causing harm – fossil fuels, weapons, anything like that,” she says. “We do try to live sustainably – we no longer fly, have a mainly plant-based diet, and cycle instead of drive wherever possible – but, to me, moving our pensions is the most responsible thing we can do.” Roy officially retired from his job as a community family worker this week and had a lump sum with Standard Life, which he has transferred. The couple’s cash is now in a range of funds operated by companies such as Baillie Gifford (its Positive Change Fund), Fidelity (Sustainable Water &amp; Waste Fund) and Royal London (Sustainable Leaders), where the top holdings include the electric car manufacturer Tesla and the US biotech firm and Covid-19 vaccine maker Moderna. David Macdonald, the founder of the Path, believes this is by far the best way individuals can help the environment. “Without checking exactly how and where pension funds are invested, people could be propping up companies that support fossil fuel developments, deforestation and those involved in warfare,” he says. Most workplace pension schemes automatically default members into a prescribed fund, although many offer an ethical or sustainable fund option and will allow employees to allocate some or all of their money to that. If you are unhappy with the options available, you could contact the trustees of your workplace pension scheme to ask how much of your money is invested in – for example – fossil fuels, if there is a divestment option (where money is moved out of things such as oil, coal and gas companies) and, if not, could one be set up. Investments Choosing ethical funds has definitely paid off for investors. Data from the investment firm AJ Bell shows that the average 10-year total return from UK non-ethical funds stood at 81% at the end of September 2020, while for UK ethical funds it was 104%. The top-performing ethical fund over the 10 years, with a 196% return, was Royal London Sustainable Leaders. The number of funds available is growing all the time. However, as each individual has their own views about the companies and sectors they are happy to support with their cash, and how much risk they are willing to accept, it is a good idea to talk to a financial adviser. There are also a number of ethical investment platforms that typically allow people to invest directly in bonds or shares issued by charities and businesses. They include Ethex, Abundance and Triodos’s crowdfunding site. Mortgages It used to be pretty much only Ecology building society that was selling green mortgages but there are now a few lenders offering them. For example, last June, Saffron building society launched the Retro Fit Mortgage, which rewards borrowers with a rate reduction if they carry out work that improves a property’s energy efficiency, and Nationwide has a similar offer for additional borrowing. Similarly, NatWest recently launched a scheme where people who buy a home with an energy performance certificate rating of A or B can get a reduced rate and £250 cashback on selected fixed-rate mortgages.",Ethical money; Money; Consumer affairs; Pensions; Current accounts; Banks and building societies; Savings; Investments; Mortgages; Ethical and green living; Environment; UK news,Money
2020-09-24T05:00:05Z,It's time to get serious about food waste in fight against global heating | Dave Lewis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/sep/24/its-time-to-get-serious-about-food-waste-in-fight-against-global-heating-paris-climate,"As a society, we are converting more and more land to food production, with massive consequences for wildlife, water and forests. Yet one third of all food produced is thrown away and food waste is responsible for a staggering 8% of all global greenhouse gas emissions, more than any country in the world bar the US and China. This is an environmental disaster but it is a social and economic one, too, when more than 800 million people are undernourished and food waste costs the global economy $940bn (£737bn) each year. The effects of climate change are already being felt, in droughts, fires and extreme temperatures. But while climate is high on the agenda, the role food waste plays is not. Not enough companies are making financial disclosures related to climate or food waste. And not a single country mentions food waste in its nationally determined contribution (NDC) to the Paris climate agreement, each country’s plan to keep climate change in check. That must change. If we continue to waste good food at current levels, we will fatally undermine our ability to tackle the climate emergency. Recognising the scale of the problem, the United Nations included a food loss and waste reduction target in their suite of Sustainable Development Goals, approved five years ago this week. This target, SDG 12.3, calls on the world to halve per capita food waste by 2030. Once this target was set, a group of leaders asked how we could help motivate action to achieve it and Champions 12.3 was formed – a coalition of more than 30 senior leaders from governments, businesses, international organisations, research institutions, and civil society, dedicated to accelerating progress towards SDG 12.3 We are now only 10 years away from the 2030 deadline. In order to meet it, more must be done and with more urgency than ever before. That’s why Champions 12.3 is calling for every country and company involved in the food supply chain to commit to SDG 12.3. To quantify and report publicly on their food loss and waste. And, based on this, to take action. We call this the target, measure, act approach and we urge more governments and companies to adopt it as their own. Significant progress is being made. The UK has cut its food waste by 27% since 2007 and other countries around the world are reporting progress. Companies are doing their part, too. This week, Champions 12.3 will announce that more businesses than ever have set targets to cut food waste in their operations, including 10 global companies – among them six of the world’s largest food retailers – who have engaged more than 200 of their suppliers to cut food waste across supply chains. The next step will be to encourage more companies not only to set targets but to report their progress publicly. Tesco was the first UK retailer to publish food waste data back in 2013 because we know that what gets measured, gets done. Since then we have started reporting food waste data for every one of the markets we operate in, cut 45,000 tonnes of food waste from our global operations and more than halved food waste in central Europe. Just as importantly, our suppliers are helping us to cut waste from farm to fork. Seventy-one of our branded and own-label suppliers, including 11 of the world’s largest brands, are publishing food waste data alongside us. That includes 15 global suppliers who are reporting for their packhouses for the first time this year and have committed to extend their reporting to their farm operations next year. Collectively, they have cut more than 155,000 tonnes of waste from their operations in three years. As I end my time as the chair of Champions 12.3, it is clear that there is still much more to do but I believe we can rise to the challenge together and halve global food waste by 2030. Covid-19 has brought this issue into sharp focus in every country around the world. Governments are thinking about how to make supply chains more resilient and consumers are rethinking the value of food. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to tackle food waste and, in doing so, help to change the course of the global climate emergency. Companies and countries talk about building back better. Now is the time to put that into action. By committing to halve global food waste by 2030 and publishing food waste data. By integrating food loss and waste into climate strategies, including NDCs. And by investing in food loss and waste reduction as part of Covid-19 responses. At Tesco, we won’t rest until absolutely no good food goes to waste. As a global community, we can’t rest until all food companies and governments take action, too.

2020-11-11T22:00:50Z,Banks around world in joint pledge on 'green recovery' after Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/nov/11/banks-around-world-in-joint-pledge-on-green-recovery-after-covid,"The world’s publicly financed development banks have pledged to tie together their efforts to rescue the global economy from the Covid-19 crisis and the climate emergency, using their financial muscle to assist a green recovery for poor countries. But the banks stopped short of pledging an end to fossil fuel finance, and did not set out firm targets for how much funding they would devote to a green recovery in a declaration signed on Thursday by 450 development banks worldwide. Poverty and climate campaigners said publicly funded banks and rich country governments needed to do much more to address the shortfall in finance to poor countries to help them reduce greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the ravages of climate breakdown. A report by the OECD group found that rich countries provided about $79bn in climate finance in 2018, an increase of about 11% on the previous year. However, the annual growth rate has halved: in 2016 climate finance was $59bn, which grew by 22% to $71bn in 2017. The total is also still well short of the target of $100bn a year of climate finance for developing countries from 2020, agreed under the UN more than a decade ago. The $100bn pledge is one of the cornerstones of the UN climate talks, as poor countries have agreed to curb their greenhouse gas emissions in return for receiving such help. The OECD also found that climate finance from private-sector sources was failing to grow at the levels needed to reach the $100bn target. Developing countries received, in 2018, about $14.6bn in private-sector investment in climate-related activities, from green technology to increasing resilience to storms and floods. This figure was scarcely changed from the previous year, though was an increase of about $4.5bn from 2016. The average annual increase from 2016-2018 was $2.2bn. There are also wide disparities in how the investment is distributed. According to the report, only about 14% of climate finance is going to the world’s least developed countries, and only about 2% is going to the “small island developing states”, which are in danger of inundation from storms and sea level rises. Tracy Carty, senior policy adviser at Oxfam, said: “This is particularly unjust [as these countries] have done the least to cause the climate crisis but are being hit hardest. Climate finance is a lifeline for communities facing record heatwaves, terrifying storms and devastating floods.” She also said that a large proportion of the publicly funded finance to poor countries came in the form of loans instead of grants. “Wealthy countries should stop inflating their [climate finance] figures with loans that will have to be repaid, and start increasing grants, especially for the most vulnerable countries to use for adaptation.” The World Bank told the Guardian that definitions of climate finance were becoming problematic, as global investment had changed dramatically since 2009, when the 2020 finance goal was put in place. Over the past 10 years the cost of renewable energy has plummeted, and in many parts of the world it is now cheaper than fossil fuel power. That has spurred record levels of investment in clean growth, which is not always captured in conventional measures of climate finance. “A lot of how countries invest now is just considered as development, not climate-change investment,” a World Bank official said. “The discussion is very blurred about what is climate finance and what is not.” However, campaigners said that too little assistance was going to help poor nations adapt to the impacts of climate breakdown, which rarely attracted private investors. Jonathan Farr, senior policy analyst at the charity WaterAid, pointed out that water in particular was a crucial issue, as the impacts of extreme weather were felt in droughts, floods and other threats to water supplies. He said: “We are calling on public development banks to support a package of essential public services, including ensuring access to water, sanitation and hygiene services. This will enable developing countries to be so much more resilient to all sorts of crises, both now and in the future. “We must support the three billion people who are facing down a pandemic without access to the water and soap they need to wash their hands, and the two billion who don’t have access to safely managed drinking water and are under threat from the droughts, floods and extreme weather caused by climate change.” Rémy Rioux, chief executive of the French Development Agency, called the pledge of public development banks to increase their focus on the climate emergency and UN sustainable development goals, a positive move. “This is a very significant part of the recovery [from Covid-19], these are concrete steps. It’s very important that this direction has been set.” The banks’ declaration, which also includes commitments to biodiversity, gender equality and human rights, was made at the Finance in Common conference, organised by the French government in support of the fifth anniversary of the Paris climate agreement this December. It was held online at a time that had been scheduled for Cop26, the UN climate summit, now delayed to next November. Odile Renaud-Basso, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said: “The Covid-19 crisis has demonstrated that only joint action allows us to address the most urgent global challenges effectively and efficiently. In overcoming the crisis, our goal must be to build economies that are sustainable, resilient and inclusive.” Marcos Neto, director of the finance sector hub at the UN Development Programme, said the pledge marked an important step by ensuring that the banks would align their lending and resources with the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, and that it was now time for the governments that funded the banks to change their mandates – which could require legislation – to ensure their lending practices led to lower emissions. “Should this have happened five years ago? Probably yes, but better late than never,” Neto said. “Now I hope there will be a much faster transition.”",Climate finance; Banking; Green economy; Paris climate agreement; OECD; United Nations; Global development; Renewable energy; Fossil fuels; Fossil fuel divestment; Business; Environment; World news,Global development
2020-11-11T11:27:19Z,Valerie Curtis obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/nov/11/valerie-curtis-obituary,"The only person – probably – ever to give a speech at the United Nations featuring a plastic poo, Valerie Curtis, who has died aged 62 of cancer, was one of the world’s first “disgustologists” and was dubbed by her fans the “Queen of Hygiene”. A behavioural scientist, she devoted her career to researching and championing hygiene, sanitation and behaviour change. Val began her career as an architect at Arup Associates, working on the new British Library, before her desire to make a greater difference drove her to take up posts with international NGOs such as Oxfam. She worked in Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda throughout the 1980s, often in conditions of famine and civil war, installing water pumps in remote communities. It was there that she developed her interest in behaviour. For most of the 90s Val was in Burkina Faso, working on studies to understand risk factors for childhood diarrhoea. There she met her first husband, Moctar Sacande, and raised two children, Naïma and Abidine. She came to realise that health education was not enough to change people’s behaviour. This insight led to her later career focus on how to use emotions such as disgust to drive behaviour change. Moving back to the UK in 2000, Val found her academic home at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), where she demonstrated a rare ability to combine science, communication and practical wisdom to become a pioneer in the field of water, sanitation and hygiene (Wash). She became director of the environment health group at the school and was appointed professor of hygiene in 2016. Her unusual multidisciplinary background gave her the intellectual flexibility to move comfortably between being a world-class academic, and an adviser to governments, international agencies and the private sector on how to promote safe hygiene and prevent child deaths. Her passion to change people’s perspectives enabled her to communicate complex scientific theory and results in a way that was engaging, not only through scientific papers, but also through several accessible books, a TEDx talk, and her fabled “plastic poo” speech at the UN in 2003. She frequently appeared in broadcast and print media and was awarded the health communicator of the year award in 2009 by the BMJ in recognition of her achievements. She had a talent for conceiving research that would capture the public’s attention, and once hooked, would communicate clear and important public health information. One example was swabbing commuters’ hands in the UK to highlight widespread faecal contamination. As she had planned, the results were picked up extensively by the media and she was able to raise awareness of an important public health issue. I had the pleasure and privilege of collaborating with Val on a major study on hand hygiene in British motorway service stations. The rates of handwashing with soap were horrifyingly low: around 60% in women and only 30% of men, but higher on average if there were other people around in the washbasin area. One cannot overstate Val’s influence in pushing hygiene up the global health agenda. She played a critical role in having hygiene included under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, co-founded the Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing (now the Global Handwashing Partnership), helped establish Global Handwashing Day, co-developed the Behaviour Centred Design model for behaviour change, and worked with organisations in over 70 countries on the design and evaluation of innovative Wash interventions. Her most recent achievements included helping design the Tanzanian government’s national sanitation programme, leading to a significant increase in toilet building. The pride of her career was her involvement as a behaviour change adviser to the Indian government’s Swachh Bharat campaign to end open defecation in India, which resulted in the extraordinary achievement of building more than 85m toilets in just five years. Val was born in Seascale, Cumbria. Her father, Geoffrey Curtis, was a physicist at the UK Atomic Energy Authority, and her mother, Margaret (nee Snelling), a keen botanist and environmental scientist. She and her two brothers grew up in Helsby, Cheshire, where she attended the Queen’s school in Chester. At Leeds University in 1980 she gained a BSc in civil engineering (chosen because her father told her girls could not be engineers). She completed her PhD in anthropology at Wageningen University, in the Netherlands, in 1998. In 2004 Val met her intellectual and life partner, Robert Aunger, at LSHTM, and they became a powerful public health duo, co-authoring books, papers and designing behaviour change campaigns together. Val was political and made no apologies for this. She chose a career in public health research because she loved science but also because she believed it could lead to a better, fairer world. In July, she wrote a moving and personal account of her own struggle with vaginal cancer in the Guardian. She hoped that her personal tragedy might add to the momentum for a bold visionary plan for the NHS, true to its founding principles but fit for the modern day. This summer, she was called upon to support the British government in its efforts to control Covid-19 as part of the behaviour subgroup of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage). Despite her worsening health, she even attended some meetings from her hospital bed. She also became an invaluable member of the corresponding behavioural group of Independent Sage, a body not answerable to government. Her expertise, and decades of experience, were exactly what was needed as the UK struggled to contend with a disease outbreak that still threatens our health system and economy. Val loved opera, especially Wagner, and joined her husband in a pilgrimage to Bayreuth. In her last days, using a wheelchair, she fulfilled a lifelong ambition to be surrounded by the harmonious symmetry of the Palladian villas in Italy, and insisted that all those she most loved join her in that experience. Her first marriage ended in divorce. She and Robert married this year; he survives her along with Naïma and Abidine, and her brothers, David and Jeremy, • Valerie Curtis, behavioural scientist, born 20 September 1958; died 19 October 2020",Hygiene; Society; Medical research; People in science; Science; United Nations; Burkina Faso; Health; Media; Health policy,Society
2020-09-27T23:01:00Z,World leaders pledge to halt Earth’s destruction ahead of UN summit,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/28/world-leaders-pledge-to-halt-earth-destruction-un-summit,"World leaders have pledged to clamp down on pollution, embrace sustainable economic systems and eliminate the dumping of plastic waste in oceans by the middle of the century as part of “meaningful action” to halt the destruction of nature on Earth. Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel, Justin Trudeau, Jacinda Ardern and Boris Johnson are among 64 leaders from five continents warning that humanity is in a state of planetary emergency due to the climate crisis and the rampant destruction of life-sustaining ecosystems. To restore the balance with nature, governments and the European Union have made a 10-point pledge to counteract the damage to systems that underpin human health and wellbeing. The commitments include a renewed effort to reduce deforestation, halt unsustainable fishing practices, eliminate environmentally harmful subsidies and begin the transition to sustainable food production systems and a circular economy over the next decade. The leaders describe the pledge as a “turning point” by which future generations will judge their willingness to act on environmental destruction. All signatories to the Leaders’ Pledge for Nature, launched virtually in New York on Monday, have committed to putting wildlife and the climate at the heart of post-pandemic economic recovery plans, promising to address the climate crisis, deforestation, ecosystem degradation and pollution. The announcement comes ahead of a major UN biodiversity summit on Wednesday, which will be hosted virtually from New York, and part way through negotiations on a Paris-style international agreement on nature. The speaking slots at this week’s summit are oversubscribed, with more than 116 heads of states and governments asking to address the event. “Science clearly shows that biodiversity loss, land and ocean degradation, pollution, resource depletion and climate change are accelerating at an unprecedented rate. This acceleration is causing irreversible harm to our life support systems and aggravating poverty and inequalities as well as hunger and malnutrition,” the pledge reads. “Despite ambitious global agreements and targets for the protection, sustainable use and restoration of biodiversity, and notwithstanding many local success stories, the global trends continue rapidly in the wrong direction. A transformative change is needed: we cannot simply carry on as before.” The leaders also commit to ending environmental crime and cracking down on organised crime groups involved in the illicit trafficking of wildlife and timber. Boris Johnson will speak at the pledge’s launch on Monday. The prime minister will say: “We must turn these words into action and use them to build momentum, to agree ambitious goals and binding targets. “We must act now – right now. We cannot afford to dither and delay because biodiversity loss is happening today and it is happening at a frightening rate. Left unchecked, the consequences will be catastrophic for us all. Extinction is forever – so our action must be immediate.” He will also announce that 30% of the UK’s land will be protected for nature by 2030, meaning an extra 400,000 hectares, the size of the Lake District and South Downs national parks combined, will be conserved. Other signatories to the pledge include the leaders of Bangladesh, Bhutan, Colombia, Costa Rica, Fiji, Kenya, Seychelles and Mexico. The presidents of the US, Brazil and China – Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro and Xi Jinping – have not signed the pledge, despite Xi spearheading global biodiversity talks. Earlier this month, the UN announced that the world failed to meet a single target to slow the loss of the natural world for the second consecutive decade, including goals to protect coral reefs, preserve natural habitats and reduce plastic and chemical waste to levels that do not damage ecosystems. There have been a series of damning reports and studies about the state of nature on Earth in recent weeks, including the WWF and the Zoological Society of London’s (ZSL) Living Planet Report 2020, which found global populations of mammals, birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles plunged by 68% on average between 1970 and 2016. The UN’s biodiversity head, Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, welcomed the new commitment by world leaders, describing it as an “inspirational contribution” to ongoing negotiations due to “the urgency, unity and ambition of the pledge”. Sir Robert Watson, former chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), described the pledge as “outstanding” and praised the links leaders have made between the destruction of the natural world and the Sustainable Development Goals. But Sir Watson cautioned what was possible without the signatures of major polluters. “Many of the most important countries in the world that are causing climate change due to their emissions of greenhouse gases, and/or are destroying their biodiversity, are not signatures to this pledge. Without countries such as the USA, Brazil, China, Russia, India, and Australia we cannot succeed in achieving the Paris Climate goal or halting and ultimately reversing the loss of biodiversity,” he told the Guardian. Marco Lambertini, the director general of WWF International, said: “The Leaders’ Pledge for Nature marks a pivotal moment with countries demonstrating real leadership from the highest political level, and committing to reverse biodiversity loss by 2030. We call on all leaders to build on this ambition at the forthcoming UN summit on biodiversity.” • This article was amended on 28 September 2020 because Sir Robert Watson is a former chair of IPBES, not the current one as an earlier version said.

2020-07-16T21:30:57Z,"DfiD merger will 'severely impact' UK's status, concludes cross-party inquiry",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jul/16/dfid-merger-will-severely-impact-uks-status-concludes-cross-party-inquiry,"A cross-party committee of MPs has said Boris Johnson’s “rushed and impulsive” merger of the Foreign Office and Department for International Development will “severely impact the UK’s superpower status”. Attacking the prime minister’s decision as “coming out of the blue”, a report published on Thursday from the Commons international development committee (IDC) said it was likely it would be disruptive and “incredibly costly”. Publishing its final report from its inquiry into the effectiveness of UK aid, the IDC raised concerns about the lack of consultation ahead of the merger and asked for a full explanation to be given to parliament, including why the decision had been taken amid a pandemic and when the UK aid budget was facing multi-billion-pound cuts. The committee also called on the government to outline its plans for DfiD’s staff and experts and to clarify how its “refreshed international policy” would help towards meeting the UN’s sustainable development goals, to which the UK is committed. In an interim report on 9 June, the IDC had recommended the retention of DfiD. Just 10 days later, the prime minister announced the merger with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The committee outlined the “glowing reviews” it had heard of DfiD’s work to help the world’s poorest people and the department’s retention of development specialists which, the IDC said, was essential to the UK’s position as a power on the world stage. Expressing fears over whether poverty reduction would remain a key goal of government policy, the report called for a cabinet minister for development to be retained. There are fears the UK merger may reflect the worst aspects of similar, costly mergers in Australia and Canada. Both experienced a loss of experts that damaged those countries’ international reputations. The IDC welcomed Johnson’s commitment to continue spending 0.7% of gross national income on development, but called for a transparency in the government’s future aid strategy. It expressed concerns over scrutiny and recommended the Commons create a new select committee to oversee UK aid spending. The IDC chair, the Labour MP Sarah Champion, said: “We have now come to the end of our deep-dive into how effective UK aid is. Our evidence shows DfiD has a glowing reputation overseas, its expertise envied and its aid programmes delivering a lifeline for many of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable. DfiD gives the UK considerable international standing and is something we should all be proud of. “It is deeply disappointing that the government failed to recognise these strengths as it made its impulsive move to have the FCO swallow up DfiD. Now we are on the brink of this expertise being lost and our international reputation being damaged beyond repair. “The fact that there was no consultation, seemingly no evidence as to why this is a good idea, really lets down the communities that UK aid is there to support.” The merger has caused widespread dismay among international development groups and many praised the IDC’s findings. Stephanie Draper, chief executive of Bond, a UK network for NGOs, said the report called into question not only the timing but “the entire rationale of the government’s decision to merge DfiD and the FCO”. Danny Sriskandarajah, chief executive of Oxfam GB, said: “The committee is right – the demise of DfiD is likely to do real damage to the world’s poorest people and to Britain’s international standing. “British people expect our aid to be used for the benefit of those without clean water, medicines or food. But the timing and presentation of this merger clearly indicate that it was primarily about politics rather than becoming more effective in helping people to escape poverty.”",Global development; Foreign policy; Aid; Politics; Society; UK news; World news; Boris Johnson; Conservatives; House of Commons,Global development
2019-11-13T12:53:06Z,Cost of ending maternal deaths laid bare as $115bn funding shortfall revealed,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/nov/13/cost-of-ending-maternal-deaths-laid-bare-as-115bn-funding-shortfall-revealed-nairobi-summit,"The global push to stop mothers dying unnecessarily in childbirth, meet family planning needs and end violence against women could be undermined by a massive funding shortfall, researchers have found. World leaders have pledged to redouble efforts to end preventable maternal death, satisfy family planning demand and stop violence and harmful practices against women and girls by 2030. But figures published this week show that achieving these aims will require an additional $222bn investment over the next decade. Research conducted by the UN population fund (UNFPA) and Johns Hopkins University, in collaboration with Victoria University, the University of Washington and Avenir Health, found that only $42bn in aid is expected to be spent on advancing these goals as things stand. “We have a collective responsibility and opportunity to deliver on our promises – now,” said Natalia Kanem, executive director of the UNFPA. “We cannot wait another 25 years. It’s time to fill these resource gaps and make this a decade of delivery. It’s time to get the job done.” Ending preventable maternal deaths will cost a projected $115.5bn, with $68.5bn required for unmet family planning needs and $79.4bn to end gender-based violence and other harmful practices. “We now know how much and where we need to invest. These figures are a drop in the ocean compared with the dividend expected and the funds available,” said Kanem. “These are smart, affordable investments that will transform the lives of women and girls, their societies, and our world. The cost of inaction is much higher.” The figures were released at a summit in Nairobi this week to mark the 25th anniversary of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), where 179 ministers pledged to implement a programme of action that called for women’s reproductive health and rights to be central in all national and international development efforts. The three-day summit, hosted by the government of Kenya, Denmark and the UNFPA, is an attempt to get governments, NGOs, the private sector and foundations to recommit to promises made in 1994, and to push for action to achieve the sustainable development goals by 2030. “With strong financing momentum we can achieve these transformative results, complete the ICPD programme of action and meet the sustainable development goals on time by 2030,” said Kanem. Denmark has pledged $15m for the UNFPA, with the UK promising a further $545m. Attendees have been asked to endorse a statement pledging to back efforts to achieve universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights. “The Nairobi Statement and 1,000-plus commitments so far are powerful signals of our intention to secure reproductive health rights and rights and choice for all, once and for all,” Kanem added. “I thank the 164 member states, here voluntarily out of good will and concern, not to negotiate new documents or language, but to uphold existing agreements and to share and learn from each other.” Rasmus Prehn, Denmark’s minister for development cooperation, told the summit: “We are here for every woman and every girl across the globe. For dreams of a life in safety, dreams of a life without violence and a future where everyone lives on an equal footing. “We can make change together with determination, strong commitments and new, innovative partnerships and alliances and across sectors, organisations, states. Amina Mohammed, the UN’s deputy secretary general, said: “As critical accelerators for the sustainable development goals, the outcomes of ICPD must be carried forward. The success of the global agenda for sustainable development, our common framework for people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership, depends on it. “The UN system commits to integrate the outcomes of the Nairobi summit as an integral component in the decade of action to deliver on the sustainable development goals.” According to the UNFPA, more than 800 women die daily during pregnancy and childbirth, while 232 million women wanting to avoid pregnancy are not using a safe and effective method of contraception. Calling for synchronised action, Victoria Chou, a researcher with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said: “Closing the substantial gap with investment of urgently needed resources will ultimately improve health among women and their families, and that vision is what should motivate us looking forward after the Nairobi Summit.” Private sector organisations including the Ford Foundation, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Philips, World Vision and many others announced that they will mobilise $8bn in combined new pledges to end preventable maternal deaths, unmet need for family planning, gender-based violence and other harmful practices by 2030. The summit has not gone unopposed. A group of civil society organisations, led by Citizen Go, presented a petition calling on the Kenyan president to reject the summit commitments in their entirety. A protest is planned on Thursday.",Reproductive rights; Women's rights and gender equality; Global development; Contraception and family planning; Reproductive rights; Society; World news; Kenya,Global development
2019-06-16T16:47:49Z,Radical action needed to hit UK’s zero-carbon target | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/16/radical-action-needed-to-hit-uk-zero-carbon-target,"Theresa May is deceiving us, either deliberately or through ignorance, with regard to the goal of reducing carbon emissions to zero by 2050 (May puts 2050 zero emission target into law, 12 June). This is impossible for any economy based on mass consumption. Over decades, most British manufacturing has shifted abroad, in particular to Asia where labour is cheap. These items are usually produced with high carbon outputs, with electricity supplied through coal. For an accurate figure of Britain’s emissions, our consumption of goods produced overseas must be included. As Britain’s consumption has increased enormously over the past 30 years, this carbon addition will be substantial. It is a nonsense for rich countries, with increasing consumption that is excluded from carbon calculations, to pretend they are cutting carbon emissions. A British child during their lifetime may produce at least 200 times more carbon than a poor African child. And it is the poor child who will suffer first from climate change. For a successful response to climate change, reality must take precedence over public relations. Nature cannot be cheated. Michael Stone Moretonhampstead, Devon • Now that the government is claiming bragging rights on carbon emissions, would this be a good time to reprint in a prominent position the report, hidden in last Monday’s business section, which reveals that the UK gives £2.5bn per year to developing countries in support of fossil fuel projects (Government criticised for funding fossil fuel-burning plants abroad, 10 June)? Celia Forsyth Kendal, Cumbria • We welcome plans announced to cut the UK’s emissions. To achieve the target, the Committee on Climate Change estimates we will need a 10% shift away from travel in cars towards walking, cycling and public transport. That means thinking radically about how we design our towns and cities, the requirements on developers and how we target infrastructure investment towards schemes that prioritise active travel. But we can’t afford to wait. Our charter for walking neighbourhoods sets out steps to encourage walking, such as making cities greener, implementing default 20mph speed limits and involving communities in the design and maintenance of public spaces. The benefits reach beyond mitigating climate change: neighbourhoods that are green and walkable inspire people to be more active, promoting physical and mental health, improving air quality and creating places where people want to live and work. Gemma Cantelo Head of policy and advocacy, The Ramblers • On consecutive days last week we heard political commitments about the crisis caused by climate change and the impact of the UK’s progress on the sustainable development goals (SDGs). But neither announcement was linked to the other. Theresa May’s introduction of a legally binding agreement for the UK to cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 was preceded in parliament by Rory Stewart introducing a debate on the government’s approach to reporting on progress on the SDGs to the UN in July. The 17 SDGs represent an opportunity to tackle the root causes of climate change and biodiversity loss, eliminate extreme poverty and put the world on a more sustainable path. Yet four years after the goals were agreed, the government has not provided a coherent plan on how it is going to achieve them. It is due to report to the UN in July, but the international development secretary and a coterie of ministers were unable to tell parliament last week when this report would be published. We can only hope the new prime minister will put as much energy into achieving the UK’s obligations on the SDGs as they do in promoting their Brexit solutions during the Tory leadership race.

2020-06-15T14:16:53Z,"Covid-19 pandemic is 'fire drill' for effects of climate crisis, says UN official",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/15/covid-19-pandemic-is-fire-drill-for-effects-of-climate-crisis-says-un-official,"The coronavirus pandemic is “just a fire drill” for what is likely to follow from the climate crisis, and the protests over racial injustice around the world show the need to tie together social equality, environmental sustainability and health, the UN’s sustainable business chief has said. “The overall problem is that we are not sustainable in the ways we are living and producing on the planet today,” said Lise Kingo, the executive director of the UN Global Compact, under which businesses sign up to principles of environmental protection and social justice. “The only way forward is to create a world that leaves no one behind.” She said there were “very, very clear connections” between the Covid-19 and climate crises, and the Black Lives Matter protests around the world, which she said had helped to reveal deep-seated inequalities and “endemic and structural racism”. “We have seen illustrated to everyone that social inequality issues are part of the sustainable development agenda,” Kingo said. Human rights were “inseparable” from dealing with climate breakdown, she told the Guardian in an interview. “This horrible racism [seen in the killing of George Floyd] is about human rights. We have to make sure that we give the social part of the agenda equal focus.” She called on business leaders to take heed. “We want all chief executives to become social activists – to understand social equality,” she said. Not only was this the right thing to do, but “it creates stable markets for companies around the world” and reflects the desires of young people. “Young people are so engaged, so dedicated to this agenda, they don’t want to work for companies that do not have a solid responsibility strategy,” she said. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said building a fairer society would be essential to the world’s health, as well as to saving the planet from climate breakdown and ecological destruction. “Today, the fabric of society and the wellbeing of people hinge on our ability to build a fair globalisation,” he told the two-day UN Global Compact virtual conference of business leaders, which started on Monday. “Where once ‘do no harm’ was a common approach for the business community, today we are arriving at a new landscape of elevated expectations and responsibilities. But despite progress, serious threats would undermine our future, including climate change, poverty, loss of biodiversity and widening social inequalities. The pandemic has underscored the world’s fragilities, which extend far beyond the realm of global health.” Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, told the conference that the Covid-19 crisis had shown how urgent it was to tackle global heating. “This is a crisis that will involve the whole world and from which no one can self-isolate,” he said. He called for all companies to provide clear information to customers, the public and investors about how they plan to move to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. More than 10,000 companies are signed up to the UN Global Compact, and they are being urged to strengthen their commitments to cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Many have pledged to cut carbon in line with the Paris agreement goal of holding global temperature rises to no more than 2C. But scientific studies show that this may not be enough to stave off disaster, and that the consequences of even 1.5C of global heating will be severe. Kingo wants companies to revise their business plans in order to reduce carbon in line with a 1.5C goal. “We need to see leadership to drive this,” she said. A report by the UN for the 20th anniversary of the Global Compact found that only four in 10 companies had targets that would enable them to meet the UN’s sustainable development goals by the 2030 deadline, and fewer than a third thought their industry was moving fast enough. While 84% of companies participating in the UN Global Compact were taking action on the goals, fewer than half were “embedding” those targets into their core business activities, and only 37% were designing their business models to meet the goals. “The human community is completely interconnected and interdependent,” Kingo said. “Without solidarity, especially with those most vulnerable among us, we all lose. We are paying the price for turning a blind eye to obvious injustices in the world.”",Climate crisis; Sustainable development; Coronavirus; Black Lives Matter movement; United Nations; Environment; World news; Business,Environment
2020-09-15T13:15:36Z,World fails to meet a single target to stop destruction of nature – UN report,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/15/every-global-target-to-stem-destruction-of-nature-by-2020-missed-un-report-aoe,"The world has failed to meet a single target to stem the destruction of wildlife and life-sustaining ecosystems in the last decade, according to a devastating new report from the UN on the state of nature. From tackling pollution to protecting coral reefs, the international community did not fully achieve any of the 20 Aichi biodiversity targets agreed in Japan in 2010 to slow the loss of the natural world. It is the second consecutive decade that governments have failed to meet targets. The Global Biodiversity Outlook 5, published before a key UN summit on the issue later this month, found that despite progress in some areas, natural habitats have continued to disappear, vast numbers of species remain threatened by extinction from human activities, and $500bn (£388bn) of environmentally damaging government subsidies have not been eliminated. Six targets have been partially achieved, including those on protected areas and invasive species. While governments did not manage to protect 17% of terrestrial and inland water areas and 10% of marine habitats, 44% of vital biodiverse areas are now under protection, an increase from 29% in 2000. About 200 successful eradications of invasive species on islands have also taken place. The UN said the natural world was deteriorating and failure to act could undermine the goals of the Paris agreement on the climate crisis and the sustainable development goals. The UN’s biodiversity head, Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, said humanity was at a crossroads that would decide how future generations experience the natural world. “Earth’s living systems as a whole are being compromised. And the more humanity exploits nature in unsustainable ways and undermines its contributions to people, the more we undermine our own wellbeing, security and prosperity,” she said. The report is the third in a week to highlight the devastating state of the planet. The WWF and Zoological Society of London (ZSL)’s Living Planet Report 2020 said global wildlife populations were in freefall, plunging by two-thirds, because of human overconsumption, population growth and intensive agriculture. On Monday, the RSPB said the UK had failed to reach 17 of the Aichi targets and that the gap between rhetoric and reality had resulted in a “lost decade for nature”. The 20 Aichi biodiversity targets are broken down into 60 separate elements to monitor overall progress. Of those, seven have been achieved, 38 have shown progress and 13 elements have shown no progress. Progress remains unknown for two elements. A leading target to halve the loss of natural habitats, including forests, has not been met. While global deforestation rates have decreased by about a third in the past five years compared with pre-2010 levels, the degradation and fragmentation of biodiversity-rich ecosystems in the tropics remains high. Wilderness areas and wetlands have continued to disappear and freshwater ecosystems remain critically threatened. Half a trillion dollars of harmful government subsidies for agriculture, fossil fuels and fishing are highlighted in the report as a particular area of concern by its lead author, David Cooper, deputy executive secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity. “We are still seeing so much more public money invested in things that harm biodiversity than in things that support biodiversity,” he said. Although there has been progress in some regions, the proportion of overfished marine stocks has increased in the last decade to a third of the total, and many non-target species are threatened because of unsustainable levels of bycatch. As a result, the target to sustainably manage and harvest all fish and invertebrate stocks has not been met. Plastic waste and excess nutrients have not been brought to levels that do not damage ecosystem function and biodiversity around the world, according to the report. About 260,000 tonnes of plastic particles have accumulated in oceans with severe impacts on marine ecosystems, often with unknown implications. Electronics pollution is also highlighted as an issue of increasing concern, fuelled by high consumption rates. More than 60% of the world’s coral reefs are under threat, especially because of overfishing and destructive practices, and a 2015 target to minimise threats was missed. It was also missed in 2020, with the climate crisis, ocean acidification and costal development blamed for their poor state. The target on protecting life-sustaining ecosystems while taking into account the needs of women, indigenous communities and poor people were not met. The assessment of the state of nature on Earth found ecosystems that provide clean water, medicine and support livelihoods have not been protected, disproportionally affecting women and vulnerable communities. The report authors, however, pointed to the conservation efforts that led to as many as 48 species being saved from extinction in recent decades as a sign of hope. Cooper said: “Hidden behind those global aggregates there is important progress and, you know, that gives us signs that if you do put policies in place, they do work.” He added that the failure to meet the targets was down to certain governments not understanding the scale of the challenge faced by the natural world. “I think countries are taking it seriously, but perhaps sometimes they’re leaving it to the environment ministries and not elevating this enough to something that’s got to be the whole of government.” The report comes as parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity negotiate the targets for this decade. The final round of negotiations for agreement had been scheduled to take place in Kunming, China, last October but have been delayed by the coronavirus pandemic and are now expected to take place in May 2021. A significant part of the draft proposal is to protect 30% of the planet. Basile van Havre, a co-chair of the negotiations, said one of the main lessons of the Aichi biodiversity targets was that the next set must be achievable. “I think it was a very laudable objective to set aspirational targets in the last decades. They’re hard to reach and clearly you hear that people want to have realistic targets,” he said.

2020-09-04T06:15:17Z,The girls and women fighting to stop child marriage – photo essay,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/sep/04/the-girls-and-women-fighting-to-stop-child-marriage-photo-essay,"Twelve million girls are married every year before they reach 18, according to UN estimates. And in its first set of global statistics on child marriage rates among boys, the UN found one in 30 young men were married as children. Advances have been made, however. Ending child marriage by 2030 is a target in the UN’s set of sustainable development goals, and many countries have launched strategies to stop the practice. But progress is slow and likely to be badly affected by the coronavirus pandemic as closed schools and financial pressures take their toll on families. In April, the United Nations Population Fund predicted that an additional 13 million children could be married over the next decade because of disruption to programmes. But some girls and women are taking matters into their own hands and campaigning for change where they live. The girls who speak here were photographed in collaboration with the London-based NGO Girls Not Brides – an international network of more than 1,400 civil society organisations working to end child marriage and enable girls to fulfil their potential. Ruby, 16 – Nepal When she was 15, a man asked Ruby’s parents for permission to marry their daughter. In Nepal, about 40% of girls are married before they turn 18, and most marriages are arranged by family members. But Ruby knew that girls in Nepal can’t legally be married until they reach 20. With support from Janaki Women’s Awareness Society, based in Dhanusha, south of Kathmandu, which educates girls on their rights, she was able to persuade her parents to turn the proposal down. “I will get married after I’m 20. I want to learn to use a sewing machine. And then I want to open a big tailoring shop in the market, stitch clothes and earn my own money. I’ll stitch lehenga, suits, dresses and shirts. I like good embroidery designs and pearls.” Ruby making a henna pattern and with friends Ruby is encouraging her friends to do the same. “I told all my friends to study. To learn some skills to be independent and then get married. If you get married now, you will have children and life will be difficult.” Suci, 19 – Indonesia Suci began her campaign against child marriage by going door-to-door asking people to sign a petition. “But we wanted to do something bigger, so we decided to take our campaign on to the streets. We made a banner and marched through the village, telling people why child marriage needs to stop.” Suci’s drive to end child marriage began when her brother married a girl who was 15. She saw the difficulties the girl faced. Suci now leads a child protection group in her village in Lombok. She has visited Bangkok and Jakarta to speak about her work. About 14% of girls in Indonesia are married before 18, and the practice is common in rural areas. Poverty and gender inequality are the main drivers. Jenina, 23 – Kenya Jenina was married when she was 13. She lived with her in-laws, but because she did not get pregnant, they made life difficult for her and eventually she ran away. She is now back living with her parents, who are supporting her because they saw her much she suffered through the marriage. Jenina, who is from the Samburu community in northern Kenya, wishes she had refused to get married and told her parents she wanted to finish school. But she’s using her experience to warn other girls. Ghazal*, 18 – Lebanon When Ghazal was told she would be married, her first thought was: “I will wear a white dress and have a home and children. I can have the nice house I used to dream about in Syria.” She was 13 at the time. The man she married was 19. Three years earlier, Ghazal’s father was killed in the Syrian conflict. Weeks later, Ghazal’s mother took her and her three sisters across the border to Lebanon. She met her future husband after it was decided she would marry. “Three months later, I fell pregnant with our first child, Hana. And two months after she was born, our second child, Abas, was on the way,” Ghazal explains. Abas is now three, and Ghazal is still married to Khalid. Through the International Rescue Committee in Lebanon, she learned about reproductive health, decision-making in the home and how to maintain a healthy relationship. Ghazal’s kitchen and with her family in Lebanon “There are difficulties that we’re overcoming,” says Ghazal, with her son in her arms. “We’re not stable. We stay for two months in a house and then we move. We don’t know if we will go back to Syria. If we go back, they will take my husband immediately.” Khalid’s father was killed by the Syrian government. Ghazal is determined to stop her sister getting married so young. And, with the support of Khalid, will not let her daughter become a child bride. Yelina, 20 – Malawi Yelina almost got married when she was 17. A refugee from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, she was living in Dzaleka refugee camp in central Malawi with her father and stepmother. Yelina’s mother abandoned her as a child after she separated from her father. But she wasn’t getting on with her family. “My stepmother doesn’t want me there. She doesn’t treat me well. I thought that getting married would be a way to get away. It was the only choice I had left.” But then Yelina heard about the refugee-led organisation Solidarity of Refugee Women for the Social Welfare (Soferes) based in Dzaleka, which provides vocational training for girls at risk of child marriage. She took a hairdressing course and is now working at the small salon the organisation runs in the camp. “The money I get from this work, I use for my own needs and for the needs of my family,” Yelina says. The work has helped her cope with family life and given her options. “If there is someone hearing what I’m saying now, I would suggest to them to study rather than getting married.” * Name changed",Women's rights and gender equality; Global development; Child marriage; Society; World news; Women; Marriage; Photography; Family,Global development
2020-07-11T07:30:05Z,Covid-19 has revealed a pre-existing pandemic of poverty that benefits the rich,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jul/11/covid-19-has-revealed-a-pre-existing-pandemic-of-poverty-that-benefits-the-rich,"Poverty is suddenly all over the front page. As coronavirus ravages the globe, its wholly disproportionate impact on poor people and marginalised communities is inescapable. Hundreds of millions of people are being pushed into poverty and unemployment, with woeful support in most places, alongside a huge expansion in hunger, homelessness, and dangerous work. How could the poverty narrative have turned on a dime? Until just a few months ago, many were celebrating the imminent end of poverty; now it’s everywhere. The explanation is simple. Over the past decade, world leaders, philanthropists and pundits have embraced a deceptively optimistic narrative about the world’s progress against poverty. It has been lauded as one of the “greatest human achievements”, a feat seen “never before in human history” and an “unprecedented” accomplishment. But the success story was always highly misleading. As I show in my final report as UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, almost all of these rosy accounts rely on one measure – the World Bank’s $1.90 (£1.50) a day international poverty line – which is widely misunderstood, flawed and yields a deceptively positive picture. It has generated an undue sense of satisfaction and a dangerous complacency with the status quo. Under that line, the number of people in “extreme poverty” fell from 1.9 billion in 1990 to 736 million in 2015. But the dramatic drop is only possible with a scandalously unambitious benchmark, which aims to ensure a mere miserable subsistence. The best evidence shows it doesn’t even cover the cost of food or housing in many countries. And it obscures poverty among women and those often excluded from official surveys, such as migrant workers and refugees. Much of the touted decline is due to rising incomes in a single country, China. The consequences of this highly unrealistic picture of progress against poverty have been devastating. First, it is attributed to economic growth, justifying a “pro-growth” agenda characterised by deregulation, privatisation, lower taxes for corporations and the wealthy, easy movement of money across borders and excessive legal protections for capital. In my six years investigating governments’ anti-poverty efforts for the UN, I encountered this convenient alibi time and time again. Everything from tax breaks for the super-rich to destructive mega-projects that extract wealth from the global south are lauded as efforts to reduce poverty, when they do no such thing. Presenting the agenda of the wealthy as the best road to poverty alleviation has entirely upended the social contract and redefined the public good as helping the rich get richer. Second, the progress narrative has been used to drown out the appalling results so often brought about by this perversion of pro-growth policies. Many of the countries that have achieved great growth in GDP have also experienced exploding inequality, rising hunger, unaffordable health and housing costs, persistent racial wealth gaps, the proliferation of jobs that don’t pay a living wage, the dismantling of social safety nets and ecological devastation. These phenomena, directly related to neoliberal policies, are unaccounted for in the tale of heroic gains against poverty. Third, the rosy picture painted by the World Bank’s most publicised poverty measure has encouraged complacency. Billions of people face few opportunities, preventable death and remain too poor to enjoy basic human rights. About half the world, 3.4 billion people, lives on less than $5.50 a day, and that number has barely declined since 1990. Even high-income countries with ample resources have failed to seriously reduce poverty rates. The coronavirus has merely lifted the lid off the pre-existing pandemic of poverty. Covid-19 arrived in a world where poverty, extreme inequality and disregard for human life are thriving, and in which legal and economic policies are designed to create and sustain wealth for the powerful, but not end poverty. This is the political choice that has been made. Nowhere are these problems more evident than the UN’s sustainable development goals, which are clearly not going to be met without drastic recalibration. The SDG framework places immense and mistaken faith in growth and the private sector, rather than envisioning states as the key agents of change and embracing policies that will redistribute wealth and address precarity. Until governments take seriously the human right to an adequate standard of living, the poverty pandemic will long outlive coronavirus. This requires them to stop hiding behind the World Bank’s miserable subsistence line and abandon triumphalism about the imminent end of poverty. Deeper social and economic transformation is imperative, to avert a climate catastrophe, provide universal social protection, achieve redistribution through tax justice and ultimately to really get on track to ending poverty. • Philip Alston is John Norton Pomeroy professor of law at New York University School of Law and co-chair of the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice.

2020-10-20T16:25:02Z,Why digital equity is critical to an inclusive recovery from the pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/inclusive-sustainable-future/2020/oct/20/digital-equity-financial-inclusion-economic-recovery,"When the pandemic caused much of public life to grind to a halt earlier this year, many people found refuge online. Accessing the internet via computers, mobile devices or other technology became a portal not only to work, but also to classrooms, social lives, bank accounts and basic necessities. But for millions around the globe, this transition wasn’t realistic – or even possible. The digital divide refers to the gap between those who have access to information and communications technologies and those who lack it. This is a global issue: a recent study commissioned by Visa and conducted by global data intelligence company Morning Consult found that about half of North Americans and Australians and 40% of UK residents have trouble accessing the internet due to cost, bandwidth constraints and reliability issues. In some countries like South Africa and India, this number is much higher – 60% and 70%, respectively. Progress toward digital equity varies across different regions: although all European Union countries improved their International Digital Economy and Society Index (I-DESI) scores from 2019-2020, countries like Turkey, Mexico and Brazil still have significant strides ahead. Digital equity is a critical part of inclusive development around the globe. What’s more, it’s integral to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined by the United Nations. The UN also points out that digital equity will be a key part of economic recovery from the pandemic. Advancing an equitable digital world will require collaboration on a massive scale – so here’s what to know. What is digital equity? Much like digital transformation itself, digital equity is an evolving concept. “What digital equity means today is different than what it meant 10 years ago, and will be different in another 10 years,” says Amina Tirana, a fellow at the Visa Economic Empowerment Institute. Today, explains Tirana, the term refers to the assurance that all individuals and businesses have the opportunity to participate and receive full benefits from digital platforms. “Importantly, this includes data and communication connections, and also the availability of appropriate services and the knowledge of how to participate in the digital economy,” she says. “So, it’s not just technology, but also the purpose for which it’s used and the ability to use it.” The fact that we are not currently living in a digitally equitable world is evident in myriad ways around the globe. In the US, un- or underbanked citizens are often unable to access funds via digital platforms or apply for loans and aid online. In Nigeria, people selling pottery at open-air markets are reluctant to accept mobile payments on their smartphones because the data-related charges are cost-prohibitive; however, they will accept payments via old USSD phones, which are much more affordable than data-intensive devices. The Morning Consult survey found that while the vast majority of respondents access the internet daily, those in wealthier countries were more likely to have at-home internet connections. In India and South Africa, respondents reported using mobile data networks far more frequently. The complexities and root causes of these issues must be explored. For one, national infrastructure is a determinant of how technology is adopted across local markets. For example, in countries such as India and South Africa, there is less telecommunications infrastructure reaching individual households. Ultimately, this has led to mobile-based technology leapfrogging traditional forms of accessing the internet. Cost is also an important factor. In addition to hefty fees for data, the cost of hardware and equipment is a barrier for some. “Every country is unique, and every community has its own patterns,” says Tirana. “We need to think about digital equity and inclusion not in a single, static way, but relevant to local contexts.” Digital equity is split along gender lines, too. “It is well-established that women have much less access to digital resources,” says Tirana. This is particularly problematic since women’s economic habits are foundational to communities and households – one of the reasons why gender parity is specifically outlined as Goal Five of the UN’s SDGs. “When a woman has an extra dollar, it usually goes to household well-being, such as more food and schooling,” says Tirana. This spending helps fuel development in local economies and ladders up to increased global GDP . In fact, a 2015 report by McKinsey Global Institute suggests that gender equality could add a whopping $12 trillion to global growth. How the digital divide affects small businesses Small businesses are the backbone of many local economies. Micro businesses in particular – mom-and-pop stores with just one or two workers – contribute significantly to household incomes in many developing nations. “These types of businesses are part of the fabric of a community – they’re where many people live and shop,” says Tirana. “So if these businesses start to falter, you can imagine the significant ripple effect.” Small and micro businesses have suffered heavily in recent months. Many micro businesses work exclusively with cash, which presented a challenge when in-person transactions all but halted due to the pandemic. A digital presence for small and micro businesses is proving critical for their survival and recovery. This is increasingly true as consumers make changes to their use of cash and digital payments. The Morning Consult survey found that since COVID-19, between 40% and 54% of respondents across seven countries are using their credit and debit cards more. Many are turning to digital payments platforms more frequently. A lack of access to digital resources also impacts a business’s ability to receive government aid. Companies that do not have digital records or accounts are more easily overlooked for dissemination of relief funds. What’s more, a lack of access can be a direct impediment to individuals’ ability to make a living. While 61% of American respondents to the Morning Consult report said they need the internet to do their jobs, almost all (95%) of respondents in India reported needing connectivity through their mobile device for work. Solutions for a more digitally equitable world Advancing an equitable digital world – bridging the digital divide being one important step – requires more than simply equipping small businesses and families with devices and a WiFi connection. It’s also necessary to provide education on how to effectively use digital platforms, explains Tirana. “Businesses must be able to pivot to a new context, and certainly being connected to digital commerce is part of it, but another part is having the skills and confidence to be able to adapt accordingly and use those tools to your purpose,” she says. To this end, Visa recently announced an initiative to digitally enable 50 million small and micro businesses during the global recovery from the pandemic. Efforts will include community support for digital payments, as well as digital literacy and skills training programs. The Visa Foundation also pledged $200 million in support with a focus on women’s economic advancement over the next five years. Tirana stressed that collaboration among corporate players, NGOs, nonprofits and government entities is crucial to achieving these ambitious goals. “No one can do this alone. We need to create a new kind of leadership,” she says. Visa has long seen success with some of its ongoing initiatives to improve financial inclusion, one way in which progress can be made towards achieving digital equity. In the Dominican Republic, Visa developed a virtual prepaid solution to rapidly expand the government’s emergency disbursement program during the pandemic from 800,000 to 1.5 million beneficiaries. In Guatemala, the company used its Visa Direct solution to support the country’s emergency relief program, reaching 2 million households over the past three months. Finally, in Africa, Visa’s collaboration with fintech company PalmPay enables greater access to real-time digital payments. “A network is a community of people sending, receiving and communicating,” says Tirana. “We want to use the power of ours – along with our partners’ – to enable inclusive and equitable economic recovery, and then going forward, more resilience.” An unprecedented crisis calls for an equally extraordinary response. Economic recovery in the wake of COVID-19 will require collaborative partnerships, as well as an innovative mindset to uncover areas of opportunity and bridge long-standing chasms of social, digital and financial inequality.",,Rebuilding an inclusive and sustainable future
2020-07-07T10:44:41Z,"'We squandered a decade': world losing fight against poverty, says UN academic",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jul/07/we-squandered-a-decade-world-losing-fight-against-poverty-says-un-academic,"International institutions are losing the fight against global poverty despite “self congratulatory” messages to the contrary, according to the UN’s outgoing special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights. In his final report in the post, the Australian academic Philip Alston warns that states and global organisations are “completely off track” to meet the goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030, with more people instead likely to become highly impoverished by new shocks, including coronavirus and existing challenges like the climate crisis. He told the Guardian he was sceptical about the role of the private sector in poverty reduction. Blaming squandered opportunities, bad policies and hubris, Alston said: “Even before Covid-19, we squandered a decade in the fight against poverty, with misplaced triumphalism blocking the very reforms that could have prevented the worst impacts of the pandemic.” Amid a round of international events in the coming weeks to examine the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs), Alston suggests the framework they provide for poverty eradication appeared more tailored for “colourful posters” and “bland reports”. “Rather than providing a roadmap for states to tackle the critical problems of our time, the energy surrounding the SDG process has gone into generating colourful posters and bland reports that describe the glass as one-fifth full rather than four-fifths empty. Covid-19 and the accompanying economic debacle should provide an impetus to revisit the framework of the 2030 agenda.” Alston is particularly scathing about reliance on one of the key metrics used internationally to measure extreme poverty – the World Bank’s so-called international poverty line of $1.90 (£1.52) a day as the measure of the amount per day below which people are said to be extremely impoverished. He points to the fact that a large percentage of the world’s population live in high levels of precarity close to that limit, with nearly half living on below $5.50 a day, a figure that has barely changed in three decades. “The result is a Pyrrhic victory, an undue sense of immense satisfaction, and dangerous complacency. Using more realistic measures, the extent of global poverty is vastly higher and the trends extremely discouraging,” Alston said. “Even before the pandemic, 3.4 billion people, nearly half the world, lived on less than $5.50 a day. That number has barely declined since 1990.” He also criticises the widespread insistence, driven in large part by the World Bank’s policies, on the private sector in poverty reduction, telling the Guardian there was little evidence that it is more efficient. “The rush to fund the SDGs through ever-greater reliance on the private sector, whether through public-private partnerships or philanthropy, is a blind alley. Too many ‘win-win’ promises are fairy tales,” Alston said. “Instead multinational companies and investors draw guaranteed profits from public coffers, while poor communities are neglected and underserved.” Given the state of affairs before the coronavirus pandemic, he is also deeply sceptical that there is any prospect for improvement. “Covid-19 is projected to push hundreds of millions into unemployment and poverty, while increasing the number at risk of acute hunger by more than 250 million. But the international community’s abysmal record on tackling poverty, inequality and disregard for human life far precede this pandemic,” said Alston. “Over the past decade, the UN, world leaders and pundits have promoted a self-congratulatory message of impending victory over poverty, but almost all of these accounts rely on the World Bank’s international poverty line, which is utterly unfit for the purpose of tracking such progress,” said Alston. The expert condemned the near universal reliance on the bank’s line, which he said is deeply flawed and yields a deceptively positive picture.” Although the World Bank claims that the number of people in extreme poverty fell from 1.9 billion in 1990 to 736 million in 2015, says Alston, he adds that is “scandalously unambitious”, and evidence shows it doesn’t even cover the cost of food or housing in many countries. The poverty decline it purports to show is due largely to rising incomes in a single country, China. And it obscures poverty among women and those often excluded from official surveys, such as migrant workers and refugees. Speaking to the Guardian from New York, Alston expanded on his point about China, saying that while the country’s leaders did appear genuinely committed to poverty reduction – like other countries – that often amounted to a statistical exercise in pushing people over the World Bank’s $1.90 threshold. “One of ‘miracle’ case studies always used is China. But I remember visiting China, and meeting with key people in charge of a taskforce eradicating extreme poverty, where it would be clear the discussion was how you could take [a] village or situation to get people the extra three cents a day [to get them over the threshold], not about how to improve their miserable situation. It was a statistical challenge.” Remarking on his period in the past he added: “I think saddest things in the west is that support for poverty elimination has largely evaporated.” Alston explained it largely in terms of the focus of political interest. “It was [senator] Bernie Sanders who said to me at one stage, look how many colleagues have rallies in very poor areas. They don’t see votes in them. And the overwhelming success of the ideological campaign that supports neoliberal policies is that it has succeeded in convincing people that those in poverty have no one to blame but themselves, while supporting the notion that trickle down policies will address it.”",Sustainable development goals; Global development; World Bank; Business; Economics; Global economy; World news; Poverty,Global development
2020-04-09T05:00:38Z,Coronavirus could turn back the clock 30 years on global poverty,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-could-turn-back-the-clock-30-years-on-global-poverty,"Half a billion people could be pushed into poverty as economies around the world shrink because of the coronavirus outbreak, a new study has warned. Poverty levels in developing countries could be set back by up to 30 years, research released by the United Nations University’s World Institute for Development Economics Research warned on Thursday. “The impact will be quite devastating,” said co-author Andy Sumner, international development professor at King’s College London, who warned of a “poverty tsunami”. “Covid could lead to a very large increase in global poverty, in fact it could send the world back 10 years and could send some regions back 30 years,” said Sumner. The researchers used World Bank data to measure the effects of reduced amounts of money being spent in economies at three poverty levels – $1.90 (£1.53), $3.20 and $5.50 per day. The results showed that even if consumption shrunk by 5% – the smallest impact they modelled – it would lead to the first increase in income-related poverty since 1990. With international financial leaders meeting next week, the research has prompted calls for quick action to safeguard vulnerable populations who will not be able to ride out strict quarantine measures of the type being implemented in Europe. Oxfam has called for world leaders to agree a $2.5tn economic rescue plan to “to keep poor countries and poor communities afloat”. Sumner said urgent action is needed to create a system of safety nets that would soften the immediate blow of income loss, as well as policies to ensure people are not left mired in long-term poverty. “I don’t think you can wait another 30 years for people to return again to where they were,” said Sumner. “The time it takes to reduce poverty can be quite a while so governments have to think about how to speed that up anyway, regardless of Covid-19, but you’re going to need some quite bold redistributive programmes.” He said the potential impact of Covid-19 raised questions about the progress of the sustainable development goals set by the UN in 2015, including on universal healthcare access. Sumner said many developing countries would suffer because of their informal economies, with many people forced to continue working despite lockdowns or, as in India, having to return to villages where they will have few resources and potentially spread the virus. Human Rights Watch warned in March that a lockdown in India, where 80% of people work in the informal sector, left tens of thousands of migrants workers stranded, and could worsen hunger and homelessness. The International Labour Organization said the world’s 2 billion informal workers are most at risk because they are forced to continue working in high-risk environments and often live in cramped accommodation with limited access to sanitation. The report’s authors based their research on models that calculated whether consumption would shrink by 5%, 10% or 20%. The worst impacts were likely to be felt in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where the report estimated 80% of people newly forced into poverty would be located, based on a poverty level of $1.90 a day and a contraction of 10%. East Asia would host a higher proportion, however, if the broader understanding of poverty levels was taken into account, making up 40% of the newly poor at the $5.50 per day line of poverty. Oxfam said a new global economic plan should include the cancellation of $1tn of debt owed by developing countries, adding that the same amount should be put into an international reserve that countries could use to build up their health systems. “For the billions of workers in poor countries who were already scraping by – pulling rickshaws, picking tea or sewing clothes – there are no safety nets such as sick pay or government assistance,” said Danny Sriskandarajah, head of Oxfam GB. “Our world is facing a huge challenge, but we can get through it if we pull together. Next week’s World Bank and G20 meetings are an important opportunity for world leaders to collaborate on a joint economic rescue package to protect the most vulnerable people.”",Global health; Coronavirus; Global development; Infectious diseases; World news; Poverty; Society; Sustainable development goals,Global development
2020-04-28T05:30:00Z,'Calamitous': domestic violence set to soar by 20% during global lockdown,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/28/calamitous-domestic-violence-set-to-soar-by-20-during-global-lockdown-coronavirus,"At least 15m more cases of domestic violence are predicted around the world this year as a result of pandemic restrictions, according to new data that paints a bleak picture of life for women over the next decade. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA) has also calculated that tens of millions of women will not be able to access modern contraceptives this year, and millions more girls will undergo female genital mutilation or be married off by 2030. Natalia Kanem, the fund’s executive director, called the findings “totally calamitous”. Authorities around the world have reported rising cases of abuse as a result of Covid-19 lockdowns. The figures, published on Tuesday by the UNFPA and its partners Avenir Health, Johns Hopkins University in the US and Victoria University in Australia, assume a 20% increase in violence during an average three-month lockdown in all 193 UN member states. The figures take into account the anticipated high levels of under-reported cases. Researchers expect 15m additional cases of domestic violence for every three months that lockdown is extended. They also estimate that the disruption to violence prevention programmes because of the pandemic and the diversion of resources elsewhere could mean a third fewer cases of violence are averted by 2030. Researchers also project that up to 44 million women in 114 low and middle-income countries will be unable to access contraceptives if lockdown and Covid-19 related restrictions continue for three months and cause major disruption to services. This would result in an estimated 1 million unintended pregnancies. The International Planned Parenthood Federation has reported that more than 5,000 clinics have closed in 64 countries and Marie Stopes International predicts that Covid-19 restrictions on its services could mean 3 million additional unintended pregnancies, 2.7 million unsafe abortions and 11,000 pregnancy-related deaths. The pandemic is also expected to derail efforts to end FGM. Researchers had expected the scaling up of FGM prevention programmes over the next 10 years would mean 5.3 million fewer girls being cut. This figure is projected to be reduced by a third. Meanwhile the disruption to programmes to prevent child marriage will result in an additional 13 million children being married over the next decade. World leaders have pledged to eliminate violence against women and girls, FGM and child marriage, as well as ensure universal access to family planning by 2030, under the sustainable development goals. “It’s a calamity. Totally calamitous,” said Kanem. “It is so clear that Covid-19 is compounding the no longer subterranean disparities that affect millions of women and girls.” She said the pandemic “threatened the gains carefully eked out” over recent years. “We are very worried indeed.” She said UNFPA teams in the Arab states and east and southern Africa had reported that “people were rushing to marry their daughters” already, while deaths in childbirth in one east African country had tripled this year. Wendo Aszed, the founder of Dandelion Africa, which runs economic empowerment programmes in Kenya’s Rift Valley, said it had been forced to reduce its mobile family planning services by 40% because of coronavirus restrictions. Many women in the region have up to eight children and live on about $1.50 (£1.20) a day. “On a bad day we will have 300 people [attend mobile clinics]. Some days we get up to 700 people showing up,” said Aszed. “That has been really impacted. We cannot treat women in these places.” She said that from mid-March to mid-April, more than 40 cases of violence have been reported to her organisation, more than the total number it dealt with last year. “A lot more women are a lot more aware that they can report and can leave marriages,” she said. “Women are fed up and they are seeing opportunities. With Covid things could get a lot worse so they need to deal with this problem and then can deal with Covid.” Traci Baird, president of EngenderHealth, said UNFPA had “put numbers to things that we have been discussing for weeks”. “The magnitude of the problem is absolutely enormous and that should motivate and mobilise us to take action now and be prepared to manage and support countries, and partners and families, in catching up after. “We know what works, we have best practices that have impact,” she added. “We have to do things better and faster and smarter. We don’t have time to do learnings and ramp up phases, or workshops and meetings. We have to get back to work.”",Reproductive rights; Infectious diseases; Contraception and family planning; Women's rights and gender equality; Domestic violence; Health; Science; Global development; Coronavirus; World news; Society,Global development
2020-03-17T07:00:48Z,True numbers of FGM victims could be far higher as countries fail to record cases,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/17/true-numbers-of-fgm-victims-could-be-far-higher-as-countries-fail-to-record-cases,"The number of women and girls who have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM) could be much higher than previously estimated, as a new report shows the practice is carried out in more than 90 countries around the world. The UN estimates that 200 million women and girls have undergone FGM. But this figure is drawn from only 31 countries – 27 in Africa – where national data has been collected. After pulling together data from indirect estimates, smaller surveys, academic studies and from anecdotal evidence, researchers from Equality Now, the End FGM European Network and the US End FGM/C Network found that hundreds of thousands of cases have been documented across 92 countries in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, North America and Latin America. FGM involves the partial or total removal of the female external genitalia for non-medical reasons. In the report, published on Tuesday, the three organisations are calling on governments to commission national surveys to create a more accurate picture of global prevalence rates, which would allow a more cohesive response to the problem. Divya Srinivasan, a lawyer and Equality Now’s south Asia consultant, said the purpose of the report was to “spotlight that it is happening all over the world”. Srinivasan said the focus on stopping FGM has been targeted in Africa, where there has been some success. A study published in 2018 showed that prevalence rates had fallen sharply across Africa since the mid-1990s. In east Africa the rates fell from 71.4% in 1995 to just 8% in 2016. “But we assume it’s not happening in the rest of the world. The international community and governments need to scale up efforts across the world,” she said. Limited data means governments can “turn a blind eye and pretend it’s not happening”. According to the report, more than 500,000 women and girls in the US have undergone FGM or are at risk of doing so. In Australia, more than 50,000 women and girls had been cut, while an estimated 600,000 have undergone the practice across the EU. In the UK, 137,000 women and girls had been cut and more than 67,000 are at risk. About 70,000 had undergone FGM in Germany. Cases were also found in regions of India, Iran, Israel and Russia. But Srinivasan, who co-authored the report, said these figures are likely to be underestimates as they are largely based on figures related to diaspora communities from countries where FGM is known to be practised. In the US, for example, the figure excludes Christian communities. In an interview for the report, Jenny, who grew up in a conservative Christian home in the US midwest, said she underwent FGM when she was five. She was taught to believe that women should be submissive and that “sex for pleasure was wrong for women”. It is only recently that she has begun to talk about her experience, and started a petition to get the practice banned in Kentucky, one of 15 US states where FGM is legal. A bipartisan bill to ban FGM in Kentucky unanimously passed in January and is now heading to the Senate for consideration. “I think it is important for people to understand just because so few Americans have spoken up, it does not mean it is not happening here,” said Jenny. “There is such a silence that surrounds this practice, that until we are talking about it more, we are really never going to know the amount of girls in the US that have been affected. We have to remove the shame, make it a subject safe to talk about.” In 2015, 193 governments agreed to eliminate FGM by 2030 as part of their commitment to meet the sustainable development goals.",Women's rights and gender equality; Global development; Female genital mutilation (FGM); Health; Global health; Health & wellbeing; Society; Women; World news; Women's health,Global development
2020-03-30T15:00:26Z,UN calls for $2.5tn emergency package for developing nations,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/un-calls-trillion-emergency-package-help-developing-nations-coronavirus,"The United Nations has called for a $2.5tn emergency package to help developing countries cope with the crippling impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on their vulnerable economies. The UN said there was a “looming financial tsunami” and urged rich countries of the west to provide the sort of assistance for emerging economies as they were providing for themselves. The organisation’s Geneva-based economics arm, the UN conference on trade and development (Unctad), called for drops of money by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), extensive debt relief and a new Marshall plan to strengthen health systems. It said the $2.5tn (£2tn) cost of the package would be the equivalent of developed countries meeting the target of spending 0.7% of their national income on aid – something only Britain and a handful of other nations have achieved. Unctad said the speed at which shock waves from the pandemic had affected developing economies was even more dramatic than in the financial crisis of 2008, and expressed pessimism about the chances of a rapid bounceback. The IMF has been deluged with requests for help from more than 80 countries since the full impact of Covid-19 became evident this month. Both the IMF and the World Bank have expressed concerns about the possibility of a new debt crisis among developing countries. Unctad said in a new report that in the two months since the coronavirus began spreading beyond China, developing countries had taken an “enormous hit” from the flight of capital, higher interest rates on their debt, a fall in the value of their currencies, and lost export earnings. “The economic fallout from the shock is ongoing and increasingly difficult to predict but there are clear indications that things will get much worse for developing economies before they get better,” said the Unctad secretary general, Mukhisa Kituyi. The UN body said that as a result of a darkening global outlook, budgetary and foreign exchange constraints were bound to tighten further over the course of the year, leaving developing countries with a $2-3tn financing gap to fill. It said the lack of resources and capacity to deal with the consequences of a combined health pandemic and a global recession would be catastrophic for many developing countries and halt their progress towards the sustainable development goals, a series of anti-poverty targets that the international community has pledged to meet by 2030. In the past few weeks, members of the G20 group of developed and developing countries have announced individual stimulus packages totalling $5tn and pledged to support poorer nations. Unctad said expressions of international solidarity needed to be turned into concrete action with a four-point plan that would include: A $1tn liquidity injection provided by the IMF. The fund has the ability to boost the reserves of member countries through special drawing rights and Unctad said these should be supplemented and allocated to help those countries left behind as a “kind of helicopter money drop”. A debt jubilee for distressed economies, with the immediate suspension of payments followed by significant debt relief. The UN said the template should be the debt relief that was provided for Germany after the second world war, and that $1tn should be cancelled this year. A Marshall plan for a health recovery funded from some of the missing aid long promised but not delivered by rich countries. Unctad said an additional $500bn – a quarter of the last decade’s missing overseas development assistance – largely in the form of grants, should be earmarked for emergency health services and related social relief programmes. Capital controls to curtail the surge in capital outflows, to reduce illiquidity driven by selloffs in developing country markets, and to arrest declines in currency and asset prices. Richard Kozul-Wright, Unctad’s director of globalisation and development strategies, said: “Advanced economies have promised to do ‘whatever it takes’ to stop their firms and households from taking a heavy loss of income. But if G20 leaders are to stick to their commitment of ‘a global response in the spirit of solidarity’, there must be commensurate action for the 6 billion people living outside the core G20 economies.”",Coronavirus; Global economy; International Monetary Fund (IMF); United Nations; Business; World news; Economics; Inequality; Unctad,World news
2020-05-26T23:01:14Z,"Improve water supply in poorer nations to cut plastic use, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/27/improve-water-supply-in-poorer-nations-to-cut-plastic-use-say-experts,"Focusing on improving the water supply in developing nations could be a powerful way to fight the scourge of plastic waste in the oceans, experts have said, highlighting that the issue has received little attention. People in developing countries, and many middle-income countries, often rely on plastic bottles of water as their piped water supply can be contaminated or unsafe, or perceived as such. Hundreds of billions of plastic water bottles are produced each year. In rich countries, they are a thoughtless luxury, but in many poor and emerging economies people have few alternatives. “It is an issue, as the water supply system has problems with water quality in many countries,” said Brajesh Dubey, professor of civil engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, co-author of a new “blue paper” on the problem of plastic waste in the oceans. “The obvious solution is building a safe water supply infrastructure which ensures quality supply.” The extent of the growing plague of plastic waste in our oceans has been laid bare in recent years, prompting widespread calls for action around the world. Cleaning up plastic waste that is already in the sea has been one of the main areas of focus so far. This is necessary to remove the menace to marine life, but methods of preventing plastic waste from reaching the ocean in the first place must also take priority, according to the report published on Wednesday. Its key recommendations are to improve wastewater and stormwater management, and to build local systems for safe food and water which would remove the need for plastic bottles. Wastewater and stormwater management are needed to stop plastic containers from finding their way into rivers, and therefore the sea, when they are discarded. Better local water supplies would remove the dependency that millions of people have on plastic bottles. Other experts agreed and called for urgent action to improve water and sewage supplies around the world, which could rescue people from poverty and ill-health, as well as cut plastic waste. “Without a shred of a doubt, access to a safe and affordable drinking water supply would significantly reduce the amount of plastic used, and ultimately discarded, to deliver water to unserved populations,” said Richard Connor, editor-in-chief of the UN World Water Report, who was not involved in Wednesday’s paper. “So would improved stormwater processing, although the impact of the latter would be mitigated if people didn’t need to rely on plastic bottled water in the first place.” Providing a safe water supply must also be accompanied by sewage and solid waste collections, added Jonathan Farr, senior policy analyst at the charity WaterAid, pointing to the problem of ditches filling with plastic bottles. “The priority has to be to guarantee people a safely managed water supply. There are 2 billion people without a safely managed water supply. You can’t imagine resilient or prosperous countries without that.” Even in rich countries where the water supply is reliable and safe, people often drink bottled water, but ways can be found to wean them off it. Connor points to the example of Italy, where before the coronavirus crisis there were an increasing number of water kiosks offering refills for small sums. In the UK, there has been a move to reopen and set up free water fountains in public areas. These initiatives have been stalled by the coronavirus crisis, throwing their future into doubt. Building safe water supply and sewage networks in the dozens of countries that need it will take years. In the meantime, countries should also focus on the proper collection and recycling of plastic bottle waste, experts told the Guardian. “[Improving the water supply] will not happen overnight – in the interim, what is needed is the development of proper plastic recycling infrastructure, with proper collection and recycling,” said Dubey. “The bottles are typically from PET [polyethylene terephthalate], which has a good recycling value. What is lacking is proper collection systems and capacity locally for recycling.” A deposit and return system for plastic bottles would help, said Anne Katrine Normann and Jan-Gunnar Winther of Norway’s Centre of the Ocean and the Arctic, which published a separate paper last week on ocean management. “If it was easy to deposit used plastic bottles, it would facilitate both reuse and recycling,” they said. “It is also a matter of continuously informing people about waste treatment and the environmental impacts of plastic litter, as it takes both time and effort to change attitudes. “Society, business and nature will benefit from the accelerated reuse and recycling of plastics.” They also called for more research into the impact of a lack of clean drinking water on plastic waste levels, to spur further work on this aspect of the problem. Wednesday’s “blue paper” was commissioned by the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy, made up of 14 heads of government in support of the UN’s sustainable development goals. The report found that the growing quantities of plastic in the ocean, which are creating an unprecedented hazard for marine life – and the impacts of which are largely unknown – was “symptomatic of many societal challenges” threatening the health of the oceans, directly and indirectly. These include: The lack of access to sanitation and wastewater and stormwater processing for millions of people around the world. The need for safe use and disposal of chemicals. The development and degradation of coastal zones. The need for an efficient use of natural resources. The need for improved access to safe food and water.",Water; Environment; Access to water; World news; Plastics; Oceans,Environment
2020-04-02T11:58:32Z,UN secretary general: recovery from the coronavirus crisis must lead to a better world | António Guterres,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/un-secretary-general-coronavirus-crisis-world-pandemic-response,"Only by coming together will the world be able to face down the Covid-19 pandemic and its shattering consequences. At an emergency virtual meeting last Thursday, G20 leaders took steps in the right direction. But we are still far away from having a coordinated, articulated global response that meets the unprecedented magnitude of what we are facing. Far from flattening the curve of infection, we are still well behind it. The disease initially took 67 days to infect 100,000 people; soon, 100,000 people and more will be infected daily. Without concerted and courageous action, the number of new cases will almost certainly escalate into the millions, pushing health systems to breaking point, economies into a nosedive and people into despair, with the poorest hit hardest. We must prepare for the worst and do everything to avoid it. Here is a three-point call to action – based on science, solidarity and smart policies – for doing just that. First, suppress transmission of the coronavirus. This requires aggressive and early testing and contact tracing, complemented by quarantines, treatment and measures to keep first responders safe, combined with measures to restrict movement and contact. Such steps, despite the disruptions they cause, must be sustained until therapies and a vaccine emerge. Crucially, this robust and cooperative effort should be guided by the World Health Organization, a member of the United Nations family; countries acting on their own – as they must for their people – will not get the job done for all. Second, tackle the devastating social and economic dimensions of the crisis. The virus is spreading like wildfire, and is likely to move swiftly into the global south, where health systems face constraints, people are more vulnerable, and millions live in densely populated slums or crowded settlements for refugees and internally displaced persons. Fuelled by such conditions, the virus could devastate the developing world and then re-emerge where it was previously suppressed. In our interconnected world, we are only as strong as the weakest health systems. Clearly, we must fight the virus for all of humanity, with a focus on people, especially the most affected: women, older people, youth, low-wage workers, small and medium enterprises, the informal sector and vulnerable groups. The United Nations has just issued reports documenting how the viral contagion has become an economic contagion, and setting out the financing needed to address the shocks. The International Monetary Fund has declared that we have entered a recession as bad as or worse than in 2009. We need a comprehensive multilateral response amounting to a double-digit percentage of global gross domestic product. Developed countries can do it by themselves, and some are indeed doing it. But we must massively increase the resources available to the developing world by expanding the capacity of the IMF, namely through the issuance of special drawing rights, and of the other international financial institutions so that they can rapidly inject resources into the countries that need them. I know this is difficult as nations find themselves increasing domestic spending by record amounts. But that spending will be in vain if we don’t control the virus. Coordinated swaps among central banks can also bring liquidity to emerging economies. Debt alleviation must also be a priority – including immediate waivers on interest payments for 2020. Third, recover better. We simply cannot return to where we were before Covid-19 struck, with societies unnecessarily vulnerable to crisis. The pandemic has reminded us, in the starkest way possible, of the price we pay for weaknesses in health systems, social protections and public services. It has underscored and exacerbated inequalities, above all gender inequity, laying bare the way in which the formal economy has been sustained on the back of invisible and unpaid care labour. It has highlighted ongoing human rights challenges, including stigma and violence against women. Now is the time to redouble our efforts to build more inclusive and sustainable economies and societies that are more resilient in the face of pandemics, climate change and other global challenges. The recovery must lead to a different economy. Our roadmap remains the 2030 agenda and sustainable development goals. The United Nations system is fully mobilised: supporting country responses, placing our supply chains at the world’s disposal, and advocating for a global ceasefire. Ending the pandemic everywhere is both a moral imperative and a matter of enlightened self-interest. At this unusual moment, we cannot resort to the usual tools. Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures. We face a colossal test which demands decisive, coordinated and innovative action from all, for all. • António Guterres is secretary general of the United Nations",Coronavirus; Infectious diseases; World news; World Health Organization; Society; United Nations; Medical research; Poverty; Health,Opinion
2020-02-18T05:01:17Z,World leaders urged to 'step back from precipice' of ecological ruin,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/18/world-leaders-urged-to-step-back-from-precipice-of-ecological-ruin-aoe,"Humanity’s ongoing destruction of nature threatens the survival of our species, a group of former foreign ministers has warned, calling on leaders to step back from “the precipice” of irreversible ecological ruin and protect the planet. The planet’s rapidly warming oceans must be the focus of increased conservation efforts due to their importance in producing oxygen and food for billions of people, the former ministers added, as governments prepare to begin negotiations for a Paris-style UN agreement on nature next week. In a statement signed by 23 diplomats – including former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright and former British foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind – world leaders are urged to back the draft UN agreement to protect almost a third of the world’s oceans and land. Next week’s meeting in Rome – originally scheduled to take place in Kunming, China but moved to the Italian capital in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak – will be the first time governments formally react to the 20-point proposals to halt and reverse biodiversity loss. The current draft commits countries to protect 30% of the planet, introduce controls on invasive species, and reduce pollution from plastic waste and excess nutrients by 50%. “The loss and degradation of nature jeopardises human health, livelihoods, safety and prosperity. It disproportionately harms our poorest communities while undermining our ability to meet a broad range of targets set by the United Nations’ sustainable development goals. We must rise above politics and ideology to unite the global community around the urgent cause of protecting our planet and way of life,” reads the statement, which was released through non-profit thinktank Aspen Institute. The former ministers highlighted the climate crisis, the “excessive exploitation” of natural resources, and ecosystem degradation as grave threats to international security, warning they “imperil the future for our grandchildren”. “Humanity sits on the precipice of irreversible loss of biodiversity and a climate crisis that imperils the future for our grandchildren and generations to come. The world must act boldly, and it must act now,” the statement continues. The comments follow those by indigenous groups, scientists and business leaders ahead of the meeting in Rome. “The marine environment deserves special attention, as it covers 70% of our planet, and even people who live far inland depend on the ocean to produce half of the oxygen we breathe, to serve as the primary source of protein for over 3 billion people, and to help maintain a liveable climate,” the statement continues. “In addition to protecting 30% of the ocean, we also call on nations of the world to manage the entirety of their ocean territories in a manner that is sustainable, equitable, and integrated across sectors. This combination of protection and sustainable management will ensure the health and productivity of the global ocean on which we all depend.” Last month, the UN’s new biodiversity chief warned humanity will have “given up” on planet Earth if world leaders cannot reach an agreement this year to stop the mass extinction of wildlife and destruction of life-supporting ecosystems. When asked what not taking action would mean, Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, the acting executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, told the Guardian: “The risks will be major. One is that we will not have listened to the science and the evidence provided. Because we will not have listened, it means the global community will have said: let biodiversity loss continue, let people continue to die, let the degradation continue, deforestation continue, pollution continue, and we’ll have given up as an international community to save the planet. “I hope that’s not where any of us would want to be.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",Environment; Biodiversity; Conservation; Wildlife; Oceans; United Nations; World news,Environment
2020-02-28T15:53:08Z,Zimbabwe's president appeals for help to end country's 'financial isolation',https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/28/zimbabwe-president-appeals-for-help-to-end-countrys-financial-isolation,"The president of Zimbabwe has appealed for help in pulling his debt-ridden country out of “financial isolation”. Emmerson Mnangagwa made his passionate call for international funding after he failed to secure new loans from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, African Development Bank and the Paris Club due to outstanding foreign debts of $8bn (£6.2bn). Addressing the Africa forum on sustainable development in Zimbabwe’s northern town of Victoria Falls this week he said: “Our five-year national development plans running up to 2063 will endeavour to achieve an upper middle-income status by 2030. “The need to remain alive to the shocks of drought and the impact of climate change through the necessary social safety nets cannot be overemphasised,” he said. “We appeal for multilateral support to augment our efforts.” His pleas come amid Zimbabwe’s worst hunger crisis in a decade, with 5.5 million people in rural areas facing starvation. Humanitarian agencies have said $200m (£155m) is needed to ensure people have food. The country is also facing rising poverty levels and hyperinflation. Mnangagwa knows that only immediate political and economic reforms will secure fresh funding but he has stressed that change will cost money. “It should be understood that we are undertaking the reforms without the requisite external financial support as is the norm. It is regrettable that the funding gap for the sustainable development goals in Africa remains low and weighs down on the attainment of [the] SDGs in Africa,” he said. The forum heard that no African country is on track to achieve the 17 goals – the UN blueprint to end poverty, protect the planet and address inequalities – by the 2030 deadline. Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, Rwanda, Kenya, South Africa and Cape Verde have all made significant advances in reducing poverty, improving health, protecting the environment and reducing gender inequalities. Amina Mohammed, UN deputy secretary general, said climate change had weakened Africa’s chances of meeting the SDGs, citing the current locust outbreak as a threat to food security. “Major scientific and analytical reviews have made it clear that we are not on track to achieve the SDGs by 2030, and just a few weeks ago the African Union first report on the implementation of agenda 2063 demonstrated that, despite earlier progress, there is still an urgent need for enhanced action,” she told the forum. “As we begin this exciting decade, it is vital that we recognise the progress being made in Africa on multiple fronts. Africa continues to have some of the world’s fastest-growing economies, and growth is projected to remain stable in 2020.” She said progress had been made in “the quest for peace and security” but the number of people living in poverty had risen since 2013 and youth unemployment rates are more than twice that of adults. “There have been considerable gains in health outcomes – with less women and children dying in childbirth or because of diseases; improvements in access to education and electricity; and a dramatic rise in internet connectivity,” she added. Delegates were lauded for increased commitments on climate action, with most African countries having signed the Paris agreement, and 48 countries have ratified the convention. Initiatives like the African Continental Free Trade Agreement are also expected to spur growth. “Since no country is on track to deliver by 2030, every country must increase its ambition,” said Mohammed. “That starts with national plans, policies, budgets and institutions that are commensurate with what it will take to deliver universal access to quality social services and an economy that provides decent jobs for all. It also requires national financing frameworks that support governments in mobilising and aligning financing from all sources.” Paul Mpuga, economic affairs officer at the Economic Commission for Africa, said funding was a huge issue for a continent that needs $2.5tn to achieve the SDGs by 2030. “We have the funding gap challenge because the requirements to realising sustainable development are huge,” Mpuga said. “This is going to be an uphill task. Realising [the] SDGs is not going to be easy. Most countries may not … but the potential is strong if they take action in good governance.”",Governance; Sustainable development goals; Global development; Sustainable development; Environment; Zimbabwe; Africa; World news,Global development
2020-01-16T20:37:34Z,"US-China tensions could slow global economy, UN warns",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/16/us-china-tensions-could-slow-global-economy-un-warns,"The world economy risks suffering a sharp slowdown in 2020 that would derail international efforts to tackle the mounting climate emergency and heightened poverty around the world, the United Nations has warned. In a flagship report ahead of the annual gathering of world leaders in Davos next week, the international governmental organisation sounded the alarm that trade tensions between major countries threatened to serve as a brake on growth, with damaging consequences for sustainable development. The UN said that rumbling trade tit-for-tats between the US and China had dragged down economic growth in 2019 to the lowest level in a decade, with the prospect that a renewed flareup, financial turmoil, or an escalation of geopolitical tensions could derail a recovery this year. The warning comes after Donald Trump signed the first phase of a new trade deal with China on Tuesday, dialling down the trade standoff between the world’s two biggest economic superpowers. Although the UN said that easing trade tensions should help to propel global GDP growth to around 2.5% this year from a 10-year low of 2.3% in 2019, it warned the potential for relapse was high. Failure to keep the risks in check would mean GDP growth in 2020 slumping to about 1.8%, with knock-on consequences for government efforts to hit their sustainable development goals, it added. António Guterres, secretary-general of the UN, said: “These risks could inflict severe and long-lasting damage on development prospects. They also threaten to encourage a further rise in inward-looking policies, at a point when global cooperation is paramount.” In a pivotal year for the US as Trump seeks reelection, the UN forecasts the US growth rate would slow sharply from 2.2% in 2019 to 1.7% this year. It said subdued business confidence following the two-year trade conflict, as well as the waning impact of tax cuts introduced by Trump earlier in his presidency, were set to drag down growth in the world’s largest economy. It also predicts that growth in China would ease to around 6% this year, down from 6.1% in 2019, continuing a gradual slowdown in the world’s second largest economy following years of rapid development. Against a backdrop of continued global uncertainty over trade, economic growth in the EU is forecast to remain relatively weak compared with recent years, amid weaker levels of manufacturing output. GDP growth is expected to accelerate slightly from 1.4% in 2019 to 1.6% this year. Beyond the headline measurement of GDP, which is often criticised for failing to capture many aspects of living standards, the UN warned that other measures of wellbeing painted a bleak picture in several parts of the world. It said that the climate emergency, persistently high inequalities and rising levels of food insecurity and undernourishment continued to affect the quality of life in many nations. Economic growth while limiting carbon emissions should be a priority, it added, saying that the two aims were not necessarily conflicting ambitions. It said the mission for a greener world economy would bring not only environmental and health benefits, but also growth opportunities for nations as they invest in a low-carbon future. Elliott Harris, UN chief economist, said governments around the world should move beyond a narrow focus on promoting GDP growth, and instead aim to enhance well-being in all parts of society. “This requires prioritising investment in sustainable development projects to promote education, renewable energy, and resilient infrastructure,” he added.",Global economy; China; Davos; World news; US economy; Donald Trump; United Nations,Business
2020-06-11T17:30:02Z,Adani mine: three major insurers to have no further involvement in coal project,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/12/adani-mine-three-major-insurers-to-have-no-further-involvement-in-coal-project,"Three major insurance groups that provided cover for parts of the Adani coal project in Queensland have said they will not provide future policies to the project. AXA XL, Liberty Mutual and HDI have told Guardian Australia they will not have any further involvement in the project after previously providing insurance cover that has now expired. The names of the three companies, together with one other insurer, appear on a file seen by Guardian Australia as having provided insurance cover for the project. Construction has started on the Adani coal site – one of the most controversial fossil fuel projects in Australia’s history. The mine and its railway will export coal through Adani’s Abbot Point terminal to power plants. Insurance broker Marsh has reportedly been working with Adani since 2015 and like other companies has come under pressure from campaigners to walk away due to coal’s contribution to the climate crisis. A spokesperson for AXA XL told Guardian Australia the company “do not currently have a live insurance policy for the Carmichael mine’s assets, neither directly nor through packages, and we do not intend to do so in the future.” The spokesperson said the policy had provided “a period of residue cover for work defaults” and that this expired in 2021. The decision to break ties with the Adani project was related to a new company policy on coal, announced in January 2020. The spokesperson added that “we are all committed to a long-term ‘exit’ strategy reducing exposure to the thermal coal industry to zero by 2030 in the European Union and OECD countries, and by 2040 in the rest of the world”. A spokesperson for Liberty Mutual said the firm and its subsidiary Liberty Specialty Markets “do not have any current policies in place for the Adani Carmichael mine project”. Guardian Australia asked if the company had any ongoing involvement in the mine and its railway project. In a statement, the spokesperson added: “In January 2019, we informed the appropriate parties we would not be participating in the insurance program for the operational phase of the project. We will not have any further involvement in the Adani Carmichael mine project.” A previous policy covering early-works site construction had expired in October 2019 and the company remained “contractually obligated to a 24-month maintenance period for any defects that may arise in that specific construction following the conclusion of the period of insurance”. The spokesperson said the company recognised the risk of climate change and had a new “Office of Sustainability” that would “embed responsible investment and risk management policies into our decision-making.” The company’s 2019 environment review said “the world needs to retain some level of balance between fossil fuels and renewable sources while making the transition to a fully decarbonised system”. The company had a policy, the report said, to make no new investments in debt or equity securities of companies that generate more than 25% of their revenues from thermal coal mining and to “phase out coverage and investments for existing risks that exceed this threshold by 2023”. Two other insurers named on the files seen by Guardian Australia were Aspen RE and HDI. A statement from HDI Global said the company “is not an insurer of the Adani Carmichael coal mine project” and Guardian Australia understands this includes the railway that is part of the Carmichael project. The statement said the company could not rule out that one or more of its Australian customers could be among the mine’s contractors. The statement said the company – part of the German-owned Talanx Group – would no longer underwrite any risks for newly planned coal-fired power stations or coalmines. By 2038, the company aimed to no longer have any coal plants or mines in its portfolio. “It is part of our fundamental business principles not to grant any direct insurance cover to projects like the Adani Carmichael coal mine,” the statement said. A Marsh employee who has been a commercial risk manager for more than two years with the company, but who asked not to be named, said the insurance broker had “lost domestic clients over this already” and that some colleagues were “concerned about where Marsh stands on climate change and what we represent”. There was concern among some employees, the manager claimed, of the impact of the mine on the land and culture of the Wangan and Jagalingou people. In May, the company’s parent group, Marsh &amp; McLennan, released a one-page “client engagement principles” document, saying the firm had a commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals on climate change. That goal does not include specific temperature targets, unlike the UN’s Paris climate agreement. The document was branded as “greenwash” by campaigners. A spokesperson for Marsh told Guardian Australia the company had a “long-standing policy not to comment on the identity of clients” and pointed to its client engagement principles. “These principles do not contain a bright-line policy against any industry. Rather, we will evaluate proposed engagements that potentially conflict with these goals and determine whether work can proceed as proposed or with limitations.” The spokesperson said Marsh had adopted recommendations of the international Financial Security Board’s taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures – a project chaired by Michael Bloomberg that encourages financial institutions and companies to disclose their exposure to risks from climate change. A spokesperson for Aspen Insurance said the company could not discuss individual policies, adding: “We are currently reviewing our underwriting appetite around fossil fuel but cannot comment further at this time.” Aspen “understands the importance of environmental, social and governance issues,” the spokesperson said, and the company had joined a UN leadership platform “for the development, implementation and disclosure of responsible business practices.” In January, the Australian coach company Greyhound cut ties with a contractor building the Adani mine railway after Guardian Australia revealed its association with the coal project. Pablo Brait, a campaigner at Market Forces, a group working to highlight financial links between companies and fossil fuel projects, said: “The fact that there are more than a dozen insurers who have said that they won’t go near the Adani project speaks to the reputational risk that any company that underwrites it faces. “Most insurance policies have expiry dates and we encourage any company underwriting the project either with Adani directly or through a contractor to refuse to renew any policies when they come up for renewal or expire.” An Adani spokesperson said: “Details on insurance providers for the Carmichael Project are commercial in confidence, however we have the requisite insurance requirements in place.”",Carmichael coalmine; Adani Group; Business; Insurance industry; Coal; Fossil fuels; Environment; Queensland; Australia news,Environment
2019-12-16T23:01:33Z,UK falls six places in gender equality rankings,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/16/uk-falls-six-places-in-gender-equality-rankings,"The UK has fallen six places down the global rankings for gender equality. Despite successive prime ministers pledging to take decisive action to tackle the gender imbalances in politics and wider British society, the UK has dropped from the 15th most equal nation in world to 21st. The World Economic Forum (WEF) said Albania, Canada, Costa Rica, Latvia, Switzerland, South Africa and Spain had all leapfrogged the UK in closing the gender gap across politics, economics, health and education since the last audit in 2018. The WEF, which organises the annual meeting of politician and business leaders in Davos, Switzerland, said so little progress had been made in tackling the problem that it would take 100 years to close the global gender gap. “This year’s report highlights the growing urgency for action,” said Klaus Schwab, the founder and executive chairman of the WEF. “Without the equal inclusion of half of the world’s talent, we will not be able to deliver on the promise of the fourth industrial revolution for all of society, grow our economies for greater shared prosperity or achieve the UN sustainable development goals. “At the present rate of change, it will take nearly a century to achieve parity, a timeline we simply cannot accept in today’s globalised world, especially among younger generations who hold increasingly progressive views of gender equality.” The WEF said even the 100-year timeline would be achieved only if countries continued to make progress in tackling gender inequalities. “At the slow speed experienced over the period 2006–2020, it will take 257 years to close this gap,” it said. Iceland is ranked as the nation closest to achieving gender parity, having closed 88% of its gender gap, followed by Norway (84.2%), Finland (83.2%) and Sweden (82%). The UK scored 76.7%, a slight fall compared with 2018. Most other industrialised western nations improved their performance. Spain jumped from 29th place to 8th. The WEF said the UK performed poorly because women were sparsely represented in politics – although last week a record 220 women were elected to parliament – and men on average were paid a lot more than women. “[The] UK’s economic gender gap comes in at 58th worldwide, brought down by big gaps in the estimated earned income of women compared to men (it ranks 102 here) as well as straightforward wage inequality (76th),” the WEF said. The Global Gender Gap report 2020 said the gender wage gap in the UK was 16%, comparedwith 7% in Sweden and Norway. In the UK, more than three times the number of women are in part-time roles comparedwith men. It said there were also “massive inequalities in almost all of [the UK’s] fastest-growing job clusters of the future”, including cloud computing, engineering and artificial intelligence. The UK also does poorly for primary school enrolment, ranking 88th out of the 153 countries in the table. This is a measure of the proportion of primary school age children enrolled at school.",Gender pay gap; World news; Business; Equal pay,World news
2020-03-05T05:01:01Z,Nine out of 10 people found to be biased against women,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/05/nine-out-of-10-people-found-to-be-biased-against-women,"Almost 90% of people are biased against women, according to a new index that highlights the “shocking” extent of the global backlash towards gender equality. Despite progress in closing the equality gap, 91% of men and 86% of women hold at least one bias against women in relation to politics, economics, education, violence or reproductive rights. The first gender social norm index analysed data from 75 countries that, collectively, are home to more than 80% of the global population. It found that almost half of people feel men are superior political leaders and more than 40% believe men make better business executives. Almost a third of men and women think it’s acceptable for a man to beat his wife. The UN Development Programme (UNDP), which published its findings on Thursday, is calling on governments to introduce legislation and policies that address engrained prejudice. “We all know we live in a male-dominated world, but with this report we are able to put some numbers behind these biases,” said Pedro Conceição, director of the UNDP’s human development report office. “And the numbers, I consider them shocking. “What our report shows is a pattern that repeats itself again and again. Big progress in more basic areas of participation and empowerment. But when we get to more empowering areas, we seem to be hitting a wall.” Conceição said the data show that perceptions and expectations in society about the role of women are prejudiced against them. “While in many countries these biases are shrinking, in many others the biases are actually sliding back. If you take the overall average of the information we have, we show that on average we are sliding back – that biases, instead of shrinking, are growing back.” The figures are based on two sets of data collected from almost 100 countries through the World Values Survey, which examines changing attitudes in almost 100 countries and how they impact on social and political life. The figures cover periods from 2005-09 and 2010-2014, the latest year for which there is data. Of the 75 countries studied, there were only six in which the majority of people held no bias towards women. But while more than 50% of people in Andorra, Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden were free from gender prejudice, even here the pattern was not one of unmitigated progress. Sweden, for example, was one of several countries – including South Africa, India, Rwanda and Brazil – in which the percentage of people who held at least one bias increased over the nine years the data covered. More than half of people in the UK and the US held at least one bias. “UNDP is very conscious of the backlash against women’s rights. We are aware and we are concerned, so we think the report … is an answer to push back the pushback,” said Raquel Lagunas, acting director of UNDP’s gender team. “We cannot pick and choose, [saying]: ‘These human rights are for women, and these ones are not.’” Lagunas said it was difficult to predict whether attitudes have changed more recently, but suggested the report’s findings “may make the road ahead more difficult”. “We can see big progress in the next five years [in some countries] and still at the same time see pushback in other countries,” she said. “We need to invest and double efforts to address the hardcore areas of power – political power, economic power – and we think, we hope, this publication is going to have impact in the countries we [UNDP] work, and open conversations with governments, because gender equality is a choice.” The report comes as rights campaigners call on world leaders to accelerate action to meet global targets on gender equality. “As representatives of leading organisations championing gender equality, we’re raising the alarm about the pace of progress. There is no time left for business as usual: gender equality can be achieved for billions of girls and women by 2030, but it requires everyone to move faster,” read an open letter, signed by nine presidents and CEOs of organisations including Plan International, Women Deliver, the One Campaign and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. “We’ve found that, if the current pace continues, 67 countries – home to 2.1 billion girls and women – will not achieve any of the key gender equality targets we studied by 2030.” These countries are not just the poorest. If trends over the past two decades continue, the US will be among them. In June, a gender index published by the Equal Measures 2030 partnership found that no country was on track to achieve gender equality by 2030, the deadline to achieve the UN sustainable development goals.",Women's rights and gender equality; Global development; Gender; World news; United Nations; Women; Life and style,Global development
2020-03-12T07:00:25Z,UN under fire over choice of ‘corporate puppet’ as envoy at key food summit,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/12/un-under-fire-over-choice-of-corporate-puppet-as-envoy-at-key-food-summit,"A global summit on food security is at risk of being dominated by big business at the expense of farmers and social movements, according to the UN’s former food expert. Olivier De Schutter, the former UN special rapporteur on the right to food, said food security groups around the world had expressed misgivings about the UN food systems summit, which is due to take place in 2021 and could be crucial to making agriculture more sustainable. “There’s a big risk that the summit will be captured by corporate actors who see it as an opportunity to promote their own solutions,” said De Schutter, who criticised the opaque evolution of plans to hold the meeting, which he said emerged from “closed-door agreements” at the World Economic Forum in Davos. His comments followed protests last month over the announcement that Agnes Kalibata, the former Rwandan minister for agriculture, would lead the event, despite her role as president of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (Agra), which has been accused of promoting damaging, business-focused practices. De Schutter emphasised that his comments were not directed at Kalibata personally. In February, 176 organisations from 83 countries signed a letter to the UN secretary general, António Guterres, saying Kalibata’s appointment was “a deliberate attempt to silence the farmers of the world” and signalled the “direction the summit would take”. Kalibata was appointed by Guterres to serve as his envoy to the summit. Last year, the US national academy of sciences awarded Kalibata the public welfare medal for her work in improving livelihoods. The UN pointed to her accomplishments as an agricultural scientist and policymaker and said her time as minister had driven “programmes that moved her country to food security, helping to lift more than a million Rwandans out of poverty”. But signatories to the letter, published on the website of the Oakland Institute, accused Agra of being “puppets of agro-industrial corporations and their shareholders”. Agra was established in 2006 as an African-led, Africa-based institution. According to its website, it “puts smallholder farmers at the centre of the continent’s growing economy by transforming agriculture from a solitary struggle to survive into farming as a business that thrives”. Over the past decade Agra has been funded by the UK, as well as Canadian and US government agencies. De Schutter, who is now co-chair of the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems, said the opinions of the Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) committee on world food security (CFS) risked being drowned out during the summit. The CFS was formed in 2009 with the aim of giving farmers and communities an equal say with big businesses. “If anything, [CFS] has been more successful than anticipated,” said De Schutter. “The reality is the private sector has felt, whether correctly or not, it was marginalised in the CFS and thus it was tempting for them to establish other forums where they might feel more comfortable and set the tone for discussions.” He called for the summit to be built around the CFS and to highlight and support sustainable systems that worked for small-scale farmers. The letter to Guterres said: “With 820 million people hungry and an escalating climate crisis, the need for significant global action is urgent to deliver on the sustainable development goals by 2030”. However, Agra’s involvement would “result in another forum that advances the interests of agribusiness at the expense of farmers and our planet”, said the signatories. The letter also accused Agra of “diverting public resources to benefit large corporate interests”. Since 2006, Agra has worked to open up Africa – seen as an untapped market for corporate monopolies controlling commercial seeds, genetically modified crops, fossil fuel-heavy synthetic fertilisers and polluting pesticides. “This is an ill-conceived approach focused on monocultural commodity production by large agribusiness at the expense of sustainable livelihoods, human development, and poverty eradication,” the letter said. The UN said Kalibata’s role was to work with governments and stakeholders “to galvanise action and leadership” for the summit, speeding up efforts “to make food systems inclusive, climate adapted and resilient, and support sustainable peace”. Waiganjo Njoroge, Agra’s interim head of communications, said Kalibata was “committed to enabling an inclusive process that will draw upon the thoughts, evidence, and commitments from stakeholders all around the world”. He defended her record of “delivering an agricultural transformation that pulled millions of smallholder farmers out of poverty in her home country” and said she was “now driving a similar transformation across the continent”. In an article published by Thomson Reuters Foundation, Kalibata wrote: “We need to harness all innovative ideas and develop deeper partnerships to make this happen. As the summit’s special envoy, I will steward a global conversation to define the food systems we want for our future. This will be done by learning from each other, particularly smallholder farmers, indigenous peoples, and those who deal with food systems every day.”",Food security; Global development; Rwanda; Africa; United Nations; Farming; Pesticides; World news,Global development
2020-01-10T13:26:43Z,Ballooning debt forces poor countries to cut public spending,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/10/ballooning-debt-forces-poor-countries-to-cut-public-spending,"Poorer countries are cutting public spending in response to a “growing debt crisis”, campaigners have warned. Debt in some countries has trebled according to new figures that calculate debt reimbursements, and their impact on government expenditure, in 60 countries. The research, based on 60 countries for which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have data, consolidates figures on past debt payments from 2015 to 2018 and weighs up scenarios for the near future. Sarah-Jayne Clifton, director of the Jubilee Debt Campaign, the charity that published the numbers, said: “The world must wake up to the growing debt crisis in poor countries. Ballooning debt payments and cuts in public spending are a recipe for disaster.” Meeting the UN sustainable development goals to cut poverty and inequality requires “large increases in public spending”, Clifton said. In many countries, however, researchers found that the opposite is happening. In states with the highest debt repayments, public expenditure per person – which had been rising in countries with the lowest debt commitments – is dropping. Between 2015 and 2018, 14 of the 15 countries spending more than 18% of their revenue on servicing debt cut public expenditure per person by an average of 13%. Conversely, the 30 countries with the lowest repayments increased their public spending by 14% over the same period. By 2022, governments’ foreign debt payments could be three times as costly as they were in 2011, and higher even than at the turn of the millennium, when debt relief was high on the international agenda. Researchers predict that, by 2022, average foreign debt payments for the 63 poorest governments in the world will increase by between 133% and 216% on 2011 levels. Even in the best-case scenario – where there is strong economic growth and no economic shocks – debt payments are expected to continue to increase over the next three years. But if there are significant economic shocks – such as drops in commodity prices, rises in interest rates or widespread disasters due to global heating – researchers predict that average debt payments could reach the highest level in more than 20 years. “We need the IMF and World Bank to stop bailing out the reckless lenders who are contributing to runaway debts and play their part in bringing about fair and rapid debt restructurings for countries in crisis,” said Clifton. At more than 50%, Congo-Brazzaville was found to have made the most severe spending cuts between 2015 and 2018. Chad cut its spending by 35%. The debt crisis in both countries follows loans from oil traders. In Mozambique, public spending cuts of 21% follow secret loans from banks based in London. While Zambia’s revenue has been hit by drops in copper prices, its rising debt payments were found to be primarily due to high-interest bonds and other loans from commercial banks. In 2019 the country’s public spending is expected to be 18% lower than in 2015, with more cuts predicted by the IMF in the next few years. Following the Ebola crisis, Sierra Leone’s debt payments have risen. Public expenditure in 2018 was 10% less per person than in 2015, with even greater cuts in 2016 (17%). Nearly half of the government’s external debt burden is owed to the IMF. Mark Perera, policy and advocacy manager at the European Network on Debt and Development, said: “These figures show that citizens are bearing the greatest burden as debt crises unfold. Public services are being weakened, human rights eroded and there are less resources to deal with climate change. “Governments need to come together to agree fundamental reforms to how we prevent and tackle debt crises, including through a multilateral legal framework for debt crisis resolution, and binding rules for responsible borrowing and lending.”",Global development; Debt relief; World news; International Monetary Fund (IMF); Economics; Aid; Business; Society,Global development
2020-09-29T10:30:15Z,All eyes on China: what to look out for at the UN biodiversity summit,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/29/all-eyes-on-china-what-to-look-out-for-at-the-un-biodiversity-summit-aoe,"The year 2020 was meant to be a super year for nature and biodiversity, according to the UN. But with swathes of the planet in lockdown, Covid-19 has highlighted the risk of humanity’s unstable relationship with nature, with repeated warnings linking the pandemic with the destruction of ecosystems and species. On Wednesday, the world will gather to discuss the biodiversity crisis at a virtual summit in New York. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, Prince Charles and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, will open proceedings. Here is what to look out for. Will China step up? Next year China will for the first time host major international talks on the environment – postponed from this year – at Cop15 in Kunming, where the international community will agree a Paris-style agreement for nature. The stakes are high: governments failed to meet any of the UN targets to slow biodiversity loss for the previous decade and the drum beat of warnings about the state of the planet’s health is growing louder. Now the world’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter is tasked with using its growing might to corral 196 countries into agreeing a plan worthy of the crisis. China’s modern record on the environment is poor. Rapid economic development and huge infrastructure projects such as the Belt and Road Initiative have come at a huge cost to nature, destroying precarious ecosystems and leaving many cities with severe air pollution. But Beijing is uniquely placed to influence countries eager to follow its development model but distrustful of the conservation-focus approach of some European nations whose wild areas largely disappeared with industrialisation. “I think China is absolutely critical to the issue of both climate change and biodiversity and land degradation. We are not going to solve these problems without leadership from China,” says Sir Robert Watson, former chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), which informs the UN biodiversity negotiations with the latest science. Some privately suspect that President Xi will surprise world leaders with another major environmental commitment during his speech at the summit’s opening, just days after he ramped up China’s carbon commitments by pledging to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. “They’ve had some really bad examples of land degradation when they deforested the Yangtze basin. Now, as I understand it, they’ve done a fairly significant replanting of trees in the Yangtze basin because it was leading to extreme floods and dust bowls. They also, of course, have terrible air pollution in their cities. I’m somewhat optimistic that China wants to show it is an economic power and play a leadership role in the world,” Watson says. “I would argue that governments around the world need to work closely with China and see if, collectively, we can move in the right direction.” The absentees and the reluctant Summit organisers have been overwhelmed with requests from world leaders to speak on Wednesday. The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, South African prime minister Cyril Ramaphosa and Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, are among dozens of leaders jostling to make statements at the oversubscribed event. But the talks will be marked by those who are not scheduled to speak. The US president, Donald Trump, will not appear and nobody from his administration is scheduled to address the event. Brazilian foreign minister Ernesto Araújo – who has previously dismissed the climate crisis as a Marxist plot – had been listed to represent his country in the place of president Jair Bolsonaro but the South American leader will now speak. Russian president Vladimir Putin will not appear, sending the head of the ministry of natural resources, Dmitry Kobylkin, in his place. All three men oversee vital life-sustaining ecosystems with global significance and Brazil has traditionally been a major player in UN environmental circles through its impressive diplomatic machine. But under Bolsonaro, the Amazon rainforest continues to burn and many fear Brazil’s leader is steering his country towards environmental ruin. Last week the president hit back at the UN general assembly for a second year in a row about how the Amazon has been treated under his leadership, claiming Brazil was the target of a “brutal disinformation campaign”. While the US is not a party to the UN convention on biodiversity, Bolsonaro’s stance on the environment could have a major sway over the final Kunming agreement. Governments will listen to what Bolsonaro has to say with great interest. One to watch In between the world leaders, heads of state and royalty, indigenous youth activist Archana Soreng will also speak at the summit’s opening. The member of the Khadia tribe in India is part of the UN secretary general’s youth advisory group on climate change and will be a powerful voice for her generation. Ambition to protect the planet Before the coronavirus pandemic disrupted talks, Wednesday’s summit was meant to be the moment international leaders gave their input before negotiators headed to Kunming to thrash out a final agreement. While there is a danger that governments might ignore the environmental targets while grappling to rescue economies and save lives, there is cautious optimism that the opposite has happened. Repeated warnings linking Covid-19 and zoonotic diseases to the destruction of nature have focused minds. “Look at the number of governments and states which have registered to make statements. That clearly by itself says something,” the UN’s biodiversity head, Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, told the Guardian. “Noticeable trends have emerged in this period of pandemic and in lockdowns. It has really brought up the voices of many actors we probably would not have seen or noticed.” Despite the optimism, the ambition of the “Paris agreement for nature” will be reflected in the detail of measurable, targeted actions. As things stand, the draft Kunming agreement has headline targets of protecting 30% of the world’s land and sea by 2030, introducing controls on invasive species and reducing pollution from plastic waste and excess nutrients. Ahead of Wednesday’s summit, 64 leaders and the EU published an ambitious 10-point pledge that many privately hope will bounce other countries into being more ambitious. Watch out for how that translates into statements by countries such as Australia, China and India that did not sign the pledge. Giving nature a financial value Expressing nature’s value in financial terms has become a big focus of conservation efforts. With the cost of deforestation, pollution and species extinction absent from most economic models, calculating the economic contribution of ecosystem services that healthy forests, rivers and oceans provide to humanity has helped reframe the conservation debate. Ahead of the talks, the insurance company Swiss Re calculated that more than half (55%) of global GDP, equal to $41.7tn, is dependent on high-functioning biodiversity and ecosystem services. But the research also found that major economies in south-east Asia, Europe and the US are exposed to ecosystem decline. The EU, Germany, Norway, Costa Rica and the UK are leading efforts to increase funding for nature. But to take meaningful action on the environment, many developing nations with high biodiversity – including Brazil and a number of African countries – want the creation of a global financial system that recognises their ecosystem services. The UN’s co-chair on the Kunming process, Basile van Havre, who is tasked with combining all of the negotiating positions into a final agreement, said he understood their position. “I think they’re putting on the table some concerns that need to be heard. There are commodities leaving Brazil and going to other places in the world, and they’re feeding economies in the other places. So, if I buy food items in the supermarket, how do we flow the money back to Brazil to support conservation? I totally understand the need of those local communities.” While these issues will be sorted in the midnight negotiating hours in Kunming next year, watch for world leaders laying out their countries’ positions on ecosystem services on Wednesday. The private sector and vested interests Alongside governments, banks and private companies have announced commitments to protect nature ahead of Wednesday’s summit. HSBC, Allianz and Axa are among 26 financial institutions – representing more than €3tn in assets – calling on world leaders to reach an agreement to protect ecosystem function. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest investor, will also take part in the leaders’ dialogue on harnessing science, technology and innovation for biodiversity. But like the fossil fuel industry with climate talks, there could be significant pushback from major chemical and agricultural companies that might lose out through restrictions on fertiliser, farming practices and pollution through any agreement. Half a billion dollars of environmentally harmful government subsidies was highlighted as a key failure in the UN report on biodiversity targets. “The landscape in the private sector is a bit different on nature and that’s one advantage we have,” Van Havre notes. “All that system of agri-food is very active and very worried because their bottom line depends on effective natural systems. They’re very engaged. They’ve learned from their climate change experience. So we’re not dragging them, they’re dragging us. “It’s a very different world from the energy sector. We’re going to need to feed more people. So if anything, they have a bigger place in the world, it’s just a very different place.” The summit as a focal point for campaigners Ahead of the meeting, conservation groups and organisations have fired off a slew of press releases about biodiversity and their campaigning goals. Business leaders and philanthropists have announced increased funding for the preservation of nature alongside foreign ministers. The Wildlife Trusts has launched a £30m fundraising appeal alongside the UK’s new commitment to protect 30% of land and sea by 2030. Most events have been based around the four-day Nature for Life events, with discussions on the sustainable development goals, business and nature, global ambition and local action. • This article was amended on 30 September 2020 to reflect an update to the list of leaders expected to address the summit.

2020-04-08T06:00:09Z,Amsterdam to embrace 'doughnut' model to mend post-coronavirus economy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/amsterdam-doughnut-model-mend-post-coronavirus-economy,"A doughnut cooked up in Oxford will guide Amsterdam out of the economic mess left by the coronavirus pandemic. While straining to keep citizens safe in the Dutch capital, municipality officials and the British economist Kate Raworth from Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute have also been plotting how the city will rebuild in a post-Covid-19 world. The conclusion? Out with the global attachment to economic growth and laws of supply and demand, and in with the so-called doughnut model devised by Raworth as a guide to what it means for countries, cities and people to thrive in balance with the planet. Raworth’s 2017 bestselling book, Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st-Century Economist, has graced the bedside table of people ranging from the former Brexit secretary David Davis to the Guardian columnist George Monbiot, who described it as a “breakthrough alternative to growth economics”. The inner ring of her donut sets out the minimum we need to lead a good life, derived from the UN’s sustainable development goals and agreed by world leaders of every political stripe. It ranges from food and clean water to a certain level of housing, sanitation, energy, education, healthcare, gender equality, income and political voice. Anyone not attaining such minimum standards is living in the doughnut’s hole. The outer ring of the doughnut, where the sprinkles go, represents the ecological ceiling drawn up by earth-system scientists. It highlights the boundaries across which human kind should not go to avoid damaging the climate, soils, oceans, the ozone layer, freshwater and abundant biodiversity. Between the two rings is the good stuff: the dough, where everyone’s needs and that of the planet are being met. On Wednesday, the model will be formally embraced by the municipality of Amsterdam as the starting point for public policy decisions, the first city in the world to make such a commitment. “I think it can help us overcome the effects of the crisis”, said Amsterdam’s deputy mayor, Marieke van Doorninck, who joined Raworth in an interview with the Guardian via Skype before the launch. “It might look strange that we are talking about the period after that but as a government we have to … It is to help us to not fall back on easy mechanisms.” “When suddenly we have to care about climate, health, and jobs and housing and care and communities, is there a framework around that can help us with all of that?” Raworth says. “Yes there is, and it is ready to go.” The central premise is simple: the goal of economic activity should be about meeting the core needs of all but within the means of the planet. The “doughnut” is a device to show what this means in practice. Raworth scaled down the model to provide Amsterdam with a “city portrait” showing where basic needs are not being met and “planetary boundaries” overshot. It displays how the issues are interlinked. “It is not just a hippy way at looking at the world,” says Van Doorninck, citing the housing crisis as an example. Residents’ housing needs are increasingly not being satisfied, with almost 20% of city tenants unable to cover their basic needs after paying their rent, and just 12% of approximately 60,000 online applicants for social housing being successful. One solution might be to build more homes but Amsterdam’s doughnut highlights that the area’s carbon dioxide emissions are 31% above 1990 levels. Imports of building materials, food and consumer products from outside the city boundaries contribute 62% of those total emissions. Van Doorninck says the city plans to regulate to ensure builders use materials that are as often possible recycled and bio based, such as wood. But the doughnut approach also encourages policymakers to lift their eyes to the horizon. “The fact that houses are too expensive is not only to do with too few being built. There is a lot of capital flowing around the world trying to find an investment, and right now real estate is seen as the best way to invest, so that drives up prices,” she says. “The doughnut does not bring us the answers but a way of looking at it, so that we don’t keep on going on in the same structures as we used to.” The port of Amsterdam is the world’s single largest importer of cocoa beans, mostly from west Africa, where the labour is often highly exploitative. As an independent private company it could reject such products and take the economic hit, but at the same time almost one in five households in Amsterdam qualify for social benefits due to low incomes and savings. Van Doorninck says the port is looking at how it moves on from dependence on fossil fuels as part of the city’s new vision, and she expects that to naturally evolve into a wider debate over other pressing dilemmas brought to the forefront by the doughnut model. “It gives space to talk about whether you want to be the place where products are being stored that are produced by child labour or by other forms of labour exploitation,” she says. Raworth adds: “Who would expect in a portrait of the city of Amsterdam that you would include labour rights in west Africa? And that is the value of the tool.” Both recognise the need for national government and supranational authorities to get on board. Raworth’s last meeting just before the lockdown in Belgium was with the European commission in Brussels, where she says great interest was expressed. “The world is experiencing a series of shocks and surprise impacts which are enabling us to shift away from the idea of growth to ‘thriving’, Raworth says. “Thriving means our wellbeing lies in balance. We know it so well in the level of our body. This is the moment we are going to connect bodily health to planetary health.” • This article was amended on 8 April 2020 to remove a superfluous zero from the figure of online applications for social housing, which is 60,000.",Netherlands; Europe; World news; Coronavirus; Economics; Business; Cities,World news
2020-01-07T17:36:08Z,IMF boss says raise taxes on the rich to tackle inequality,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/07/imf-boss-says-raise-taxes-on-the-rich-to-tackle-inequality,"Raising income tax on the wealthy will help close the growing gap between rich and poor and can be done without harming growth, the head of the International Monetary Fund has said. Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director, said higher marginal tax rates for the better off were needed as part of a policy rethink to tackle inequality. In a sign of how the IMF has moved away from the tax-cutting approach that once formed a central part of its policy advice, Georgieva said there needed to be a different approach to tackling what had become “one of the most complex and vexing challenges in the global economy”. The IMF chief, writing in a blog, said: “Inequality of opportunity. Inequality across generations. Inequality between women and men. And, of course, inequality of income and wealth. They are all present in our societies and – unfortunately – in many countries they are growing.” In the 1990s, the IMF was at the heart of the Washington consensus – a free-market approach to running economies that included the belief that tax cuts for the better off would have trickle down benefits through greater innovation and higher growth. The IMF functions as the global lender of last resort, bailing out countries in financial difficulty and issuing policy advice alongside its interventions. But the IMF has shifted it stance amid evidence of weak growth, a concentration of wealth among the top 0.1% of the population, and a falling share of national output going to workers. In recent years, it has produced research disputing the Washington consensus belief that countries could have lower inequality or faster growth but not both. The world’s 26 richest billionaires – including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg – own as many assets as the 3.8 billion people who make up the poorest half of the planet’s population, according to Oxfam. In a report last year, the charity said a global wealth tax on the 1% would raise an estimated $418bn (£325bn) a year – enough to educate every child not in school and provide healthcare that would prevent 3 million deaths. “Tackling inequality requires a rethink,” Georgieva said, adding: “Despite the political difficulty of implementing reforms the payoffs for growth and productivity are worth the effort. “Progressive taxation is a key component of effective fiscal policy. At the top of the income distribution, our research shows that marginal tax rates can be raised without sacrificing economic growth.” The IMF managing director, who succeeded Christine Lagarde last year, said higher taxes on the better off, the use of digital tools to boost tax collection, and reducing corruption would help fund government spending to expand opportunities for those “communities and individuals that have been falling behind.” Tax and spending policies should also have a gender dimension, Georgieva said. “While many countries recognise the need for gender equality and women’s empowerment, governments can use gender budgeting to structure spending and taxation in ways to advance gender equality even further – increasing women’s participation in the workforce and, in turn, boosting growth and stability.” The IMF has often been criticised by development campaigners for insisting on public spending cuts as part of its rescue packages for countries in financial distress. Georgieva said the IMF recognised that social spending policies are increasingly relevant in tackling inequality. “When done right they can play a fundamental role to mitigate income inequality and its detrimental effects on inequality of opportunity and social cohesion. “Education, for example, prepares young people to become productive adults who contribute to society. Healthcare saves lives and can also improve the quality of life. Pension programmes can allow the elderly to preserve their dignity in old age.” She added that many less well-off countries needed to scale up social spending if they were to have a chance of meeting the UN’s 2030 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs), which include reducing inequality. “In key areas such as health, education, and priority infrastructure, we estimate that emerging market economies will require additional spending every year – reaching about 4 percentage points of GDP in 2030.” Georgieva said the IMF could not tackle inequality on its own. “We envision this as a partnership of international organisations, academics, country authorities, civil society and the private sector working together to enhance social spending policies and lay the groundwork for achieving the SDGs.”",International Monetary Fund (IMF); Economics; Global economy; Income inequality; Generational inequality; Inequality; Economic policy; Kristalina Georgieva; Business; World news; Politics; Tax and spending; Sustainable development goals; Sustainable development; Environment; Global development; UK news,Business
2020-01-21T07:00:50Z,"Oceans, biodiversity, deforestation: what's on the climate agenda for 2020?",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/21/oceans-biodiversity-deforestation-whats-on-the-climate-agenda-for-2020,"World leaders and business chiefs meeting in Davos this week will be confronted for the first time with an agenda on which the climate and ecological crises take top billing. Financial and economic concerns have been shunted down the list of priorities in favour of five environmental issues: climate breakdown and extreme weather; failure to mitigate or adapt to climate change; human-made pollution; biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse; and natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. Green campaigners and social and human rights activists have been raising concerns on all of these for more than two decades, but it seems that finally the world’s powers are paying attention. In some cases it may be too late to act to avoid the consequences of the delay in taking action. Since 2015 when the landmark Paris agreement was signed, greenhouse gas emissions have risen a further 4% and although there are signs the rate of increase may be slowing, that is nowhere near enough. Oceans are at the hottest ever recorded. Last year, ecological scientists said 1 million species were on the brink of extinction. The biomass of wild animals on the planet has fallen by more than 80%, about half of the area of key natural ecosystems has been lost, and insect populations have crashed, according to the report from the UN’s Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystems Services. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in 2018 that by 2030 the world must be on track or exceeding 1.5C of global heating above pre-industrial levels would be all but inevitable. Warming has already topped 1C and 2019 was the second hottest year on record. As the Davos agenda shows, businesses are taking note. Ashim Paun, the global co-head of environmental, social, and governance research at HSBC, said: “Will 2020 be an inflexion point? Our investor clients increasingly think climate change is absolutely core to their investment processes. So this year we look to major political and policy developments – the details of the EU green deal in March, the outcome of elections, particularly the US where we see the outcome as fairly binary for climate, and whether this year’s climate talks in Glasgow [in November] can regain previous momentum.” There is plenty that all people around the world can do to get involved and shape the direction of this crunch decade. “2019 proved that activism works,” said Richard George, a climate campaigner for Greenpeace. “The amazing contributions from the school strikers and Extinction Rebellion, along with many others, got us a net zero target [in the UK and other countries], and almost universal agreement that not only is climate change happening but action to stop it is both vital and urgent. What we need now is real action to get the carbon out of our energy, transport, food and finance sectors, which means turning up the heat on politicians and corporations. This is the year to do it.” There will be international conferences this year on the climate, the oceans, biodiversity, deforestation and a host of other pressing environmental concerns. Many targets and deadlines for taking action are pegged to 2020, and governments and businesses will have to answer for any failure to meet those goals. The world is changing and leaders in all spheres are recognising that people are no longer willing to passively accept environmental destruction. Here’s what to look out for in 2020. Climate Nearly five years have passed since the signing of the Paris agreement pledging to prevent global heating of more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. Since then, progress has stalled. Last year’s UN climate conference in Madrid ended inconclusively with no agreement on some basic aspects of implementing Paris. More importantly, countries’ commitments on cutting greenhouse gas emissions under the 2015 accord are inadequate to stay within the 2C limit and would lead to a disastrous 3C rise. That makes this year’s climate summit the biggest since Paris. Governments must come to COP26 in Glasgow in November armed with new emissions targets commensurate to the risk of climate breakdown. If Donald Trump is still in power, other countries must press ahead without the US and face down challenges to the Paris accord from Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Russia and others. That will be a massive struggle, and strong clear messages from civil society will be vital to its success. US presidential election Trump has blasted through federal protections ranging from clean air and water to Alaskan drilling and pipeline construction, and if he wins a second term he is likely to continue on that track. In international terms his influence has been baleful on climate action: he started the formal process to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement in 2017, and that decision that will come into effect the day after the presidential election on 3 November. COP26 begins on 9 November and the US delegation will be drawn from the Trump White House whatever the election outcome. British diplomats will be looking to use the supposedly friendly relationship between Trump and Boris Johnson to try to ensure the US does not play a disruptive role. Trump will also preside over the G7 meeting in June, which means environmental issues will be off the agenda. In some previous years, notably 2005-07, the then G8’s focus on the climate proved a valuable spur to progress in the UN climate talks. This year that will be missing. Oceans Plastic pollution, overfishing, overheating and acidification from climate change are driving a crisis in the oceans. The World Ocean Summit in early March in Tokyo will set out the latest science on ocean health and present possible solutions. Later that month, from 23 March to 3 April, comes the final scheduled meeting of the UN effort to draft a new global treaty on the seas. IGC4 aims to set out a new legally binding instrument on “the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction”. Biodiversity Ecosystems around the world, from the Amazon to the Antarctic, are on the verge of collapse owing to human encroachment and exploitation, pollution, water scarcity and the impacts of global heating. Two meetings will focus attention on the loss of biodiversity and ways to stem further destruction. The World Conservation Congress in mid-June in Marseille is a four-yearly meeting of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the organisation that compiles the global red lists of endangered and threatened species. A series of meetings held under the UN convention on biological diversity will culminate in a meeting at Kunming, China, in October where progress – or the lack of it – on protecting wildlife and plants will be assessed. The current global biodiversity action plan runs from 2011 to 2020 and its key aims are likely to be missed. A new action plan for the next decade should be adopted at the Kunming conference. Sustainable development goals The Paris agreement was not the only major international achievement of 2015: there was also the signing of the UN sustainable development goals, a set of 17 plans to remedy social and environmental ills – including eliminating poverty and hunger, empowering women and girls, improving access to healthcare and education in developing countries, and providing access to clean water and sanitation. Most of the goals are pegged to 2030, and this year is a staging post to assess progress at the UN high-level political forum in New York in July. Business The last few years have seen a new wave of environmental activism targeting businesses, whether through divestment campaigns aimed at fossil fuel investors, arts sponsorship deals or direct action. That is likely to increase in 2020 as the impact has become clearer. BlackRock made an unprecedented decision last week to start stepping out of investments with a high climate risk, and other funds will come under pressure to follow suit. There are a variety of ways people can make their views known to company boards, from questioning their pension funds to joining protests or even becoming a shareholder. Transport and the climate emergency Globalisation has led to a massive increase in carbon from shipping, which now represents 3% of all greenhouse gas emissions but will reach 17% by 2050 if unchecked. But shipping has been deliberately excluded from UN climate negotiations and little progress has been made in the last two decades on cutting greenhouse gases from one of the dirtiest forms of transport. At the International Maritime Organisation meeting in March in London, countries are supposed to come up with a new way forward to fulfil the UN agency’s aims of halving shipping emissions by mid-century – a goal that campaigners say is still inadequate. Last year Extinction Rebellion led effective protests. This year, decisions deferred last year will come back to the agenda. Deforestation In 2010, companies from around the world joined forces on a target to banish deforestation for palm oil from their supply chains permanently by 2020. That target looks far from being met, but at the Consumer Goods Forum in June in London the signatory companies will have to explain their progress and what they hope to do to improve their performance. Palm oil is one of the biggest drivers of deforestation, particularly in south-east Asia where wildlife ranging from the orangutan to the Sumatran elephant and rhino are being endangered. Consumers have the chance to make their views felt: nobody wants their grocery shopping to contribute to species loss, and there are ways to grow natural resources without causing ecological disaster. It is up to producer companies and retailers to make the difference. EU green deal and China EU summit The new European commission took office in Brussels late last year with one central promise: a green deal for Europe, by which the whole of the European economy and EU regulations would be overhauled to put environmental protections at the heart of continued prosperity. Clean energy, transport and industry will create new green jobs to replace those lost in polluting industries, and citizens will enjoy cleaner air, water, a healthier natural environment and a stable climate. That is the goal, at least. Living up to that promise will involve hard choices and skilful diplomacy, and in the course of this year the European commission, member states and EU parliament will face a series of key votes and decisions. The EU will also play a leading role in COP26, and the EU-China summit pegged for mid-September in Leipzig in Germany will be key. With the US rejecting the Paris agreement, cooperation between the world’s other biggest emitters will be vital, so the EU must forge a partnership with China or face failure at COP26.",Climate crisis; Davos 2020; Davos; Global climate talks; Oceans; Biodiversity; Sustainable development goals; Deforestation; Conservation; Environment; Business; Cop26,Environment
2020-02-19T06:00:48Z,"The world is failing to ensure children have a 'liveable planet', report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/19/the-world-is-failing-to-ensure-children-have-a-liveable-planet-report-finds,"Every country in the world is failing to shield children’s health and their futures from intensifying ecological degradation, climate change and exploitative marketing practices, says a new report. The report says that despite dramatic improvements in survival, nutrition, and education over the past 20 years, “today’s children face an uncertain future”, with every child facing “existential threats”. “In 2015, the world’s countries agreed on the sustainable development goals (SDGs), yet nearly five years later, few countries have recorded much progress towards achieving them,” says the report by a commission of 40 child and adolescent health experts from around the world. “Climate change, ecological degradation, migrating populations, conflict, pervasive inequalities, and predatory commercial practices threaten the health and future of children in every country,” it says. The commission, convened by the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations children’s agency, Unicef, and medical journal the Lancet, calls for radical changes to protect children’s health and futures from the intensifying climate emergency. It also highlights the threat of predatory commercial practices, linking children’s exposure to marketing of fast food and sugary drinks to an 11-fold increase in childhood obesity, from 11 million in 1975 to 124 million in 2016. The report includes an index of 180 countries that compares data on survival, wellbeing, health, education and nutrition; as well as sustainability, with a proxy for greenhouse gas emissions, and equity, or income gaps. Norway, South Korea, the Netherlands, France and Ireland are found to be the best countries for a child to flourish in his or her early years. The Central African Republic, Chad, Somalia, Niger, and Mali are the bottom five in the list, based on the same ranking. But when performance is compared taking per capita carbon emissions into account, Burundi, Chad and Somalia are best performers, while the US, Australia and Saudi Arabia are among the bottom 10 countries. “When authors took per capita CO2 emissions into account, the top countries [on the child flourishing ranking] trail behind: Norway ranked 156, the Republic of Korea 166, and the Netherlands 160,” the report says. “Each of the three emits 210% more CO2 per capita than their 2030 target.” “The only countries on track to beat CO2 emission per capita targets by 2030, while also performing fairly (within the top 70) on child flourishing measures are: Albania, Armenia, Grenada, Jordan, Moldova, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, Uruguay and Vietnam,” the report says. The UK is ranked among the top 10 countries when it comes to child flourishing, but placed 133rd on “delivering on emissions targets”; it is “currently on track to emit 115% more CO2 than its 2030 emissions target”. Experts behind the report agree that “while the poorest countries need to do more to support their children’s ability to live healthy lives, excessive carbon emissions – disproportionately from wealthier countries – threaten the future of all children”. Stefan Peterson, Unicef’s chief of health, said children living in the poorest countries are facing the brunt of a changing climate, despite having a tiny carbon footprint. “These children face enormous challenges to their health and wellbeing, and are also now at the greatest disadvantage due to the climate crisis,” he said. “We need sustainable gains in child health and development, which means that big carbon emitters need to reduce their emissions for all children to thrive, poor and rich.” The report says: “If global warming exceeds 4C by the year 2100 in line with current projections, this would lead to devastating health consequences for children, due to rising ocean levels, heatwaves, proliferation of diseases like malaria and dengue, and malnutrition.” Anthony Costello, professor of global health and sustainable development at University College London, said the commission was calling for a radical rethink on global child health. “Climate change threatens our children’s future so we must stop carbon emissions as soon as possible,” he told the Guardian. “Our new index shows that not a single country performed well on both child development and emissions indicators. “We also call for greater regulation of marketing of tobacco, alcohol, formula milk, sugar-sweetened beverages and gambling to children, and of social media companies which target children through secret algorithms and the inappropriate use of their personal data.” The report says children are at risk from harmful marketing. “Evidence suggests that children in some countries see as many as 30,000 advertisements on television alone in a single year, while youth exposure to vaping (e-cigarettes) advertisements increased by more than 250% in the US over two years, reaching more than 24 million young people.” Industry self-regulation has failed, said Costello, adding that in Australia, for instance, “children and adolescent viewers were still exposed to 51 million alcohol ads during just one year of televised football, cricket and rugby”. “The reality could be much worse still,” he said. “We have few facts and figures about the huge expansion of social media advertising and algorithms aimed at our children.” The commission calls on governments to put measures in place “to ensure children receive their rights and entitlements now and a liveable planet in the years to come”. “We live in an era like no other. Our children face a future of great opportunity, but they stand on the precipice of a climate crisis … our challenge is great and we seem to be paralysed,” it says.",Global health; Global development; World Health Organization; Climate crisis; Environment; Health; World news; Sustainable development goals; Children,Global development

By 2020, this country will have helped vaccinate 76 million children, saving 1.4 million lives from preventable diseases. The UK has already helped 57 million people to cope with the effects of climate change over the last eight years and is on track to reach 60 million people with clean water by 2020. About 32 million people have been supported with humanitarian assistance in the face of conflict and disasters, including at least 10 million women and girls. We should be proud of the role the UK plays in helping people out of poverty around the world, and we ask party leaders to continue to champion this incredible work. Whatever the outcome of this general election, leaders should come together to rise to the ambition of our own and global commitments. If we are to achieve the sustainable development goals by 2030, we must all work together to eradicate poverty, reduce inequality, end violence and exploitation of the most vulnerable and tackle the climate and environment emergency. Delivery of these commitments will require a shift in the way we design government policy at home and abroad so future generations can live in a safe, just, prosperous world where no one is left behind. The next prime minister has an opportunity to show the world what it means to be an outward-facing and progressive nation, a nation that is proud of our official development assistance, with a Department for International Development - represented by its own secretary of state - that delivers for those most in need.

2020-03-18T04:01:13Z,Study: global banks 'failing miserably' on climate crisis by funneling trillions into fossil fuels,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/18/global-banks-climate-crisis-finance-fossil-fuels,"The world’s largest investment banks have funnelled more than £2.2tn ($2.66tn) into fossil fuels since the Paris agreement, new figures show, prompting warnings they are failing to respond to the climate crisis. The US bank JP Morgan Chase, whose economists warned that the climate crisis threatens the survival of humanity last month, has been the largest financier of fossil fuels in the four years since the agreement, providing over £220bn of financial services to extract oil, gas and coal. Analysis of the 35 leading global investment banks, by an alliance of US-based environmental groups, said that financing for the companies most aggressively expanding in new fossil fuel extraction since the Paris agreement has surged by nearly 40% in the last year. Using Bloomberg financial data and other sources to analyse loans, equity issuances and debt underwriting services from 2016 to 2019, the analysis is published on Wednesday in the Banking on Climate Change 2020 report. It has been compiled by Rainforest Action Network, BankTrack, Indigenous Environmental Network, Oil Change International, Reclaim Finance and Sierra Club. Although the last 12 months has seen many investment banks announce financing restrictions on coal, Arctic oil and gas, and tar sands extraction, the report warns that the business practices of financial institutions are not aligned with the Paris agreement. Alongside JP Morgan Chase, the US banks Wells Fargo, Citi and Bank of America dominate financing for fossil fuels, accounting for nearly a third of the £2.2tn of financial services since the Paris agreement, according to the report. The report said big banks overall have increased their funding in the four years since Paris to companies with significant Arctic oil and gas reserves. Alison Kirsch, a researcher at Rainforest Action Network who led the analysis in the report, said: “The data reveal that global banks are not only ramping up financing of fossil fuels overall, but are also increasing funding for the companies most responsible for fossil fuel expansion.” Barclays, which has been under increasing investor pressure over its environmental stance, has been the top European financier of fossil fuels in the last four years, the figures show. Last year, the London-based bank was the largest financier of Arctic oil and gas, according to the figures. A group of influential shareholders are now urging the bank to phase out lending to fossil fuel companies, and have filed a resolution to be voted on at Barclays’ AGM in May. Fracking has been the focus of intense business activity by investment banks since the Paris agreement, with JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America leading £241.53bn of financing, much of it linked to the Permian basin in Texas. The Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto Dominion led financing for tar sands crude oil projects in Alberta, north-west Canada, which have caused widespread damage to ecosystems. The big-four Chinese banks have dominated financing for coal mining and coal power since the Paris agreement and have no policies restricting business practices. Kirsch said: “This makes it crystal clear that banks are failing miserably when it comes to responding to the urgency of the climate crisis. As the toll of death and destruction from unprecedented floods, droughts, fires and storms grows, it is unconscionable and outrageous for banks to be approving new loans and raising capital for the companies that are pushing hardest to increase carbon emissions.” Ahead of the next major international climate talks, Cop26 in Glasgow this November, the UK government has sought to make the business and the banking sector the focus of tacking the climate crisis. The former head of the Bank of England Mark Carney has been appointed as a climate envoy, warning that businesses must improve how they disclose their impact on the environment or risk failing to meet climate targets. Johan Frijns, director of BankTrack, an NGO which monitors the activities of major financial institutions, said it was time for banks to commit to phasing out financing for all new fossil fuel projects. “In the last year, banks have been queueing up to proclaim support for the goals of the Paris agreement. Both the Principles for Responsible Banking and the new Equator Principles, each signed by over a hundred banks, acknowledges the global climate goals. Yet the data in Banking on Climate Change 2020 show these laudable pledges making little difference, and bank financing for the fossil fuel industry continuing to lead us to the climate abyss,” he said. “It is high time banks recognised that reaching the Paris climate goals requires an immediate end to finance for all new fossil fuel projects, and a rapid phase-out of existing fossil finance. This should be the Global Glasgow Goal for all banks.” JPMorgan Chase said the commitments it announced last month “reflect our ongoing efforts to help address climate change and promote more sustainable development”. It added: “This includes financing to support climate action and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, backing market-based policy solutions to reduce carbon emissions, expanding restrictions on financing for coal mining and coal-fired power, and prohibiting project financing for new oil and gas development in the Arctic.” The bank looked forward, it said, to growing “its impact over time”. A Barclays spokesperson said: “We are working hard to help tackle climate change including facilitating £34.8bn of social and environmental financing last year. We continue to engage with ShareAction and other stakeholders on how we can make further progress.” Wells Fargo told the Guardian that it believes that climate change is one of the most urgent environmental and social issues of our time, and is committing to a low-carbon economy. The bank said it is working to measure and report on the carbon intensity of its credit portfolio. A Bank of America spokesperson said they recognise their role in managing climate risk and in financing the transition to a low-carbon economy.

2019-10-30T18:24:58Z,"US effort to remove ‘sexual health’ from UN agreement may violate law, say senators",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/oct/30/trump-administration-un-sexual-reproductive-health-senators-letter,"The Trump administration may have violated federal law by lobbying more than 70 countries to remove protections for “sexual and reproductive health” from a UN agreement, according to a letter from four US senators seen by the Guardian. The letter from the senators, all high-ranking Democrats, focuses on an effort from the Trump administration to remove “sexual and reproductive health” from a high-level UN agreement on universal health coverage. The group of four senators wrote they were “alarmed that your opposition to abortion care – as stated in the letter – harms women and families, as well as endangers millions of women and girls”. The letter was signed by the US senators Dianne Feinstein of California, Patty Murray of Washington, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Robert Menendez of New Jersey. “We are also concerned the letter may violate the Siljander Amendment, which prohibits use of foreign assistance in lobbying ‘for or against abortion’,” the senators wrote. Efforts to remove “sexual and reproductive health” from international agreements have continued amid the lawmakers’ criticism. This week, Kelly Craft, US ambassador to the UN, said the US “could not accept” a resolution on women, peace and security because it included references to previous resolutions that included this phrase. Removing language about sexual and reproductive health from international agreements has been a longtime goal of ultra-conservative religious organisations. The Trump administration, which relies on a base of conservative evangelical and Catholic voters, has proved a staunch ally to the groups. Administration officials have argued the phrase “sexual and reproductive health” amounts to a dramatic new interpretation of international human rights, and an effort to establish an international “right to abortion”. In fact, language on sexual and reproductive health has been an established part of international law since the 1990s. In July, the US circulated a letter to 70 countries arguing the phrase should be removed. Its efforts were unsuccessful. The phrase “sexual and reproductive health” stayed in the UN’s high-level agreement in September, and the US was only able to enlist 18 other countries to its cause, including many with poor human rights records, such as Saudi Arabia, Russia and Sudan. In September, the Trump administration made a last-ditch effort to have the phrase excluded, sending two cabinet officials to the UN to argue against its inclusion. The US health secretary, Alex Azar, criticised “language that has been used to promote abortion as healthcare”. The senators said the speech amounted to “advocating to deny resources and education that could help millions of women and girls around the world”. The effort so alarmed the international community that the Dutch minister Sigrid Kaag delivered a special statement on the phrase’s importance before the general assembly. The joint statement was signed by 58 countries, including western democracies and longtime US allies such as the UK and France. “[W]e strongly believe that sexual reproductive health and rights is an integral part of universal health coverage and that sustainable development goals,” said Kaag. The programs, she said, were “ultimately saving lives”. While the US failed to have the language excluded from the consensus agreements, it has succeeded in watering down commitments in the UN security council, where the US has a veto vote. In spring 2019, the US threatened to veto a resolution on rape as a weapon of war. To avoid a veto, diplomats pulled the phrase “sexual and reproductive health” from the agreement, watering down protections for women in armed conflict zones.",Women's rights and gender equality; Global development; United Nations; US news; World news; Gender; Abortion; Health,Global development
2019-10-29T17:30:40Z,'Damaged ideology': business must reinvent capitalism – ex-Unilever boss,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/29/damaged-ideology-business-must-reinvent-capitalism-ex-unilever-boss,"A former boss of Unilever has said capitalism is a “damaged ideology” that must reinvent itself to survive by doing more to combat inequality and the climate emergency. Paul Polman said companies that took a lead on the world’s biggest problems would be the most successful of the 21st century. Companies that put short-term profit ahead of long-term sustainability would not survive, he said. “Capitalism, which has been responsible for the growth and prosperity that has done so much to enhance our lives, is a damaged ideology and needs to be reinvented for the 21st century,” Polman said in a speech. “Business needs to reinvent capitalism. We need to build a new model of inclusive and sustainable capitalism.” Polman led Unilever, the maker of Dove soap, Marmite and Persil, for 10 years before stepping down at the end of 2018. As chief executive of one of the world’s biggest consumer goods companies, he argued for businesses to take a long-term view on urgent matters such as global heating instead of prioritising profit. Since leaving Unilever, Polman has invested in Imagine, a foundation to promote the UN’s sustainable development goals. He has also backed the young activists behind Extinction Rebellion and is a fan of Greta Thunberg. Polman said there was a compelling business case for investing in the UN’s development goals with the opportunity to create at least $12 trillion (£9.3tn) a year in economic growth and generate 380m jobs. “Companies with a strong sense of purpose are better able to grow not only revenue and profits but also create additional value, such as customer loyalty, attracting top talent and developing new products and services,” he told a dinner of business leaders held by the executive recruiter Odgers Berndtson. Companies must aim for “a next decade of delivery” to be a force for good, he said. Despite Polman’s campaigning for more responsible capitalism while he was at Unilever, the company has only recently pledged to halve its use of plastics from 700,000 tonnes a year by 2025. His replacement, Alan Jope, has also said he will sell off brands that do not contribute to society or the planet. Business leaders faced with unrest over the looming environmental disaster, social inequality and companies’ treatment of workers are trying to head off political interference by accepting that capitalism needs to change. In August, Apple, Amazon and the Wall Street bank JP Morgan were among 200 big US companies that redefined their purpose as “improving our society” and not only making money for shareholders. Some of the world’s richest and most powerful businesspeople have warned that capitalism is failing. The hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio has said the gap between rich and poor is an “existential threat” to US capitalism because it could lead to conflict, populism and “revolution of one sort or another”. Starbucks’ former chief executive Howard Schultz has said capitalism faces a crisis and has advocated higher taxes on the wealthy. In Britain, the Labour party has committed itself to a target for the UK of net zero emissions by 2030 in its version of a Green New Deal. Labour has also pledged to extend workers’ rights, cap bosses’ pay at companies that provide services to the government and increase the minimum wage to £10 for all workers.",Economics; Business; Unilever; World news,Business
2020-01-15T07:00:06Z,Nigeria's child development crisis is a tragedy. Here's how we can end it,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/15/nigerias-child-development-crisis-is-a-tragedy-heres-how-we-can-end-it,"If you want a window on the condition of children in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, there is no better vantage point than the Katanga health centre in the impoverished northern state of Jigawa. In a hut that passes for a nutrition clinic, a group of 25 women wait with their children. Tiny bodies bearing the hallmarks of acute malnutrition – distended stomachs and twig-thin limbs – are lifted into a weighing harness and their arms measured to check for signs of wasting. Ali, who has just reached his first birthday, weighs only 5kg – the average age of a two-month-old in the UK. His mother is 14. Sitting under a tree in the forecourt, another severely malnourished child is gasping for breath. Nayo, who is seven months, has the telltale symptoms of severe pneumonia – a collapsed rib cage, deep cough and fever. He desperately needs antibiotics and medical oxygen. The clinic has neither. “I’m worried for his life, there is nowhere to go for help,” his mother tells me. Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy and a global energy-exporting superpower. It is endowed with vast natural resources. But the country is rooted near the foot of the World Bank’s global league table for human capital – a composite measure capturing the health, education and nutritional status of children. Five years ago Nigeria’s leaders joined the rest of the world in embracing the 2030 sustainable development goals. They include targets to end preventable child and maternal deaths, eradicate malnutrition and give all children a quality education. Almost half of Nigeria’s 200 million population is under 15, and achieving these goals would catalyse the dynamic and inclusive growth needed to create jobs. Unfortunately, Nigeria is either treading water or sinking like a stone on all the key 2030 indicators for child development. More than 800,000 children lose their lives each year, mainly to preventable diseases such as malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea. Over the past decade, the country’s share of global under-five deaths doubled – to 16% of the total – and continues to rise. Malnutrition is endemic. Almost half of Nigeria’s children are stunted by nutritional deprivation, with devastating consequences for health and cognitive development. About 2 million face life-threatening malnutrition. Vaccination against killer diseases is critical for malnourished children. But millions of children in Nigeria have not been immunised. More than 10 million children aged 5–14 years are out of school – more than in any other country – even though education is nominally free and compulsory. Most of those in school are getting a fifth-rate education after years of underinvestment. Children with eight years of schooling typically have learning skills equivalent to four years of primary education. There are also deep fractures linked to inequalities in wealth, region and gender. Children born into the poorest 20% of families are eight times more likely to succumb to fatal illness. Young girls, especially those in the northern states, are far more likely to be forced into early marriage. Almost one in five girls are married by the age of 15, according to Unicef. Nigeria’s child development crisis is a tragedy for the country. Over the next three decades the population will double, making Nigeria the world’s third most populous country. By 2050 almost one in every 13 children born in the world will be Nigerian. Sheer weight of numbers dictates that the fate of Nigeria’s children will shape the world’s development. So what can be done to break the malaise? First, Nigeria urgently needs to convert economic wealth into human capital, starting with investment in children. Current revenue collection levels are among the lowest in the world, holding back vital public spending in areas such as health and education. Changing this picture will require a broader and deeper tax base, with strengthened royalty collection from oil companies. The federal government has passed some encouraging legislation on education and public health. But at 0.6% of GDP, Nigeria’s health spending is comparable to countries such as Yemen and Afghanistan. The result is clinics like the one in Jigawa, without trained health workers, medicines and vital equipment. Second, a national emergency response is needed to get all children into quality schooling. Unlocking the potential of Nigeria’s children would transform the country. That won’t be possible without a third component for change – a concerted drive to combat the deep inequalities facing girls and women. It is surely time for Nigeria’s politicians, as well religious and traditional leaders, to push for an end to child marriage – a practice that violates human rights, destroys opportunity and perpetuates poverty. This article was corrected on 17 January 2020 as it said by 2050 almost one in every 10 children born in the world will be Nigerian. The most recent figures project it will be one in every 13.",Sustainable development goals; Global development; Nigeria; Malnutrition; Africa; World news; Society; Child marriage; Global education,Global development
2019-07-19T08:00:06Z,Cost of global push to prevent women dying in childbirth to increase sixfold,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jul/19/cost-of-global-push-to-prevent-women-dying-in-childbirth-to-increase-sixfold,"The cost of preventing women from dying in childbirth is projected to increase sixfold by 2030, requiring billions of dollars to achieve global targets, according to the UN. The estimate was released by the UN population fund (UNFPA) on Thursday, offering a snapshot of the scale of the challenge the agency has set itself to end preventable maternal deaths by 2030. Similarly ambitious is a target established by the UN sustainable development goals to reduce maternal mortality to less than 70 deaths for every 100,000 live births. Researchers at UNFPA and Johns Hopkins University calculated that the annual cost of direct services, such as paying for medical staff, drugs and supplies when a woman is giving birth, will reach $7.8bn (£6.2bn) by 2030, up from an estimated $1.4bn last year. Donor aid for maternal healthcare fell between 2013 and 2017, from $4.4bn $3.9bn. The projected figure, which takes into account rising population as well as the cost of current interventions and scaling up services, is based on requirements in the countries with the highest number of maternal deaths. It does not include the logistics of getting women to health centres, the barriers they face to access services, or other associated costs. The most recent figures provided by the World Health Organization, which date back to 2015, showed the global maternal mortality ratio to be 216 deaths for every 100,000 live births. The number increased to 436 in the world’s least developed countries. The WHO is expected to update the figures later this year. The UNFPA said the projections, presented in New York, should be a wake-up call for governments. The agency hopes the updated estimate will drive more funding from donors and the private sector. “We want to show the facts to stakeholders that this is the situation,” said Tharanga Godallage, monitoring and data specialist at the UNFPA. “It’s a call to action … We need to accelerate [progress] as we only have 11 years left.” The agency also projected that the annual cost of meeting the growing need for modern forms of contraception would almost double, from $2.3bn in 2018 to $4.5bn by 2030. The UNFPA, working with Johns Hopkins, Victoria University, the University of Washington and global health organisation Avenir Health, will present more detailed cost projections on maternal health, family planning, ending female genital mutilation and child marriage at a November summit in Kenya to mark the 25th anniversary of the landmark international conference on population and development held in Cairo. Projections for individual countries will also be produced to encourage governments to increase their health budgets. In 1994, 179 leaders adopted a programme of action that emphasised the centrality of women’s empowerment in tackling population growth and development, as opposed to focusing simply on family planning. More than 200 recommendations were agreed, covering issues such as access to decent reproductive health services, sexual health advice and support, and the elimination of harmful practices such as female genital mutilation and forced marriage. The summit in Nairobi will assess the gaps in provision and, the UNFPA hopes, garner political and financial commitments to implement the programme of action and meet the sustainable development goals. The conference comes amid a considerable global backlash against women’s rights, and reproductive rights in particular. Speaking to the Guardian last month, Natalia Kanem, the UNFPA’s executive director, said women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights needed to be “elevated to front and centre” to achieve the SDGs. “We have to respond to the challenge on [women’s] rights,” she said. “While the SDGs are aspirational, they are also a blueprint to what human society needs in order to survive and thrive… full gender equality is of benefit to women certainly, and also a benefit to everybody.” Last Friday, the US government confirmed that, for a third consecutive year, it would not fund the UNFPA under provisions in the Kemp-Karsten amendment. The amendment prohibits foreign aid to any organisation deemed by the US administration to be involved in coercive abortion or forced sterilisation. In a statement on Monday, the UNFPA strongly denied it supported either. The statement said: “UNFPA does not perform, promote or fund abortion, and we accord the highest priority to universal access to voluntary family planning, which helps prevent abortions from occurring. “UNFPA opposes coercive practices, such as forced sterilisation and coerced abortions, and has spoken out against instances of such human rights abuses.” The statement added that the administration had yet to produce evidence to justify the “serious claims made against its work”, and reiterated an invitation for US officials to visit its offices in China. Enacted in 1985, the Kemp-Karsten amendment has been used by Republican presidents Ronald Reagan, George Bush and George W Bush to stop funding the agency. Funding was resumed under Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. The Trump administration used the amendment to defund the agency in April 2017 as one of a number of global policies introduced to restrict global funding for reproductive healthcare. In 2016, the US contributed $69m to the UNFPA to help cover the agency’s core costs and provide short-term support for projects in humanitarian settings. In 2015, the US was the agency’s third largest bilateral donor, contributing $75m to its operations.",Maternal mortality; Maternal health; Global development; Health; Society; Women; United Nations; Women's health,Global development
2019-05-01T05:00:44Z,"Cutting obesity would slash number of early deaths, research finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/01/cutting-obesity-would-slash-number-of-early-deaths-research-finds,"Thousands of early deaths from cancer, heart disease, lung disease and diabetes could be avoided if obesity was stabilised or brought to an end by 2030, helping to attain the global sustainable development goals, research shows. In the UK alone, 40,000 premature deaths would be avoided if there were no more obesity within the next decade. In a more plausible scenario, where the rise in obesity is halted but it continues at the current level, there would be 9,400 fewer deaths, says a study presented at the European Congress of Obesity in Glasgow. The research is from Novo Nordisk, a company that makes insulin for diabetes. Rates of type 2 diabetes have soared on the back of the obesity epidemic. Presenting the data in Glasgow, the scientists said addressing the growing burden of obesity was critical to cutting premature deaths from four non-communicable diseases (NCDs) – cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and diabetes – in line with the target in the UN’s sustainable development goals to reduce deaths from those causes by a third by 2030. They looked at what would happen to obesity rates in five countries, the UK, Brazil, Denmark, Mexico and Canada, in the event of three scenarios. In the first, obesity rates continue to rise at the same rate as they have been doing. In the second, they are stabilised, with BMI rates remaining at the current level. In the third, obesity no longer exists, with nobody on a BMI higher than 25, which is the upper end of the normal band. In the ideal world, with no more obesity, deaths from those diseases would drop by 25% in Brazil, 26% in Denmark, 28% in Mexico, 30% in Canada and 31% in the UK. In a more possible scenario, with obesity rates stable, deaths would fall by 5% in Brazil, Denmark, and Mexico, 6% in Canada and 7% in United Kingdom. “While eliminating excess weight is a highly hypothetical scenario, it shows the great impact obesity has on premature NCD deaths and what can be gained even by keeping obesity at today’s rates until 2030,” said the authors of the research. Niels Lund, vice-president of health advocacy at Novo Nordisk and one of the authors, said: “If we could just cap obesity at the rate it is today that would reduce premature mortality by between 4% and 7%.” Dr Kate Allen, the executive director of science and public affairs at the World Cancer Research Fund, said: “In the UK, over 60% of adults are overweight or obese, putting them at an increased risk of at least 12 different types of cancer. Evidence shows that implementing effective policies will reduce the chances of people being overweight or obese. “But it will take a whole-of-society, whole-of-government approach to solve the global obesity epidemic,” she added. “We need a range of policies that complement each other, such as restrictions on junk food advertising and subsidies on healthy foods, to shift attitudes and behaviour.” • This article was amended on 1 May 2019. Niels Lund is vice-president of health advocacy at Novo Nordisk, not an associate professor at Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada, as we said in an earlier version, and a quote attributed to him was corrected.",Obesity; Health; Diabetes; Cancer; UK news; Brazil; Denmark; Mexico; Canada,Society
2020-01-21T06:00:48Z,Tony Blair is wrong. Africa won't be the answer to Britain's post-Brexit problems,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/21/tony-blair-is-wrong-africa-wont-be-the-answer-to-britains-post-brexit-problems,"Tony Blair’s cheerleading for the UK-Africa investment summit is of a piece with much of the former prime minister’s recent career. Trading in grand-sounding ideas, often very short on detail, he brings the pitch of an evangelist crossed with a lobbyist to the world’s biggest problems. Blair’s latest piece of rhetorical woo-woo unites (and promises to address) a series of disparate preoccupations: eradicating poverty and encouraging good governance in Africa while solving the issue of Britain’s trading relationships post-Brexit. All seasoned with just a hint of post-colonial hubris. If it sounds familiar, it’s because it is, with Blair’s pitch tacking too close for comfort to the kind of foreign trade-not-aid agenda long embraced by Boris Johnson – host of the conference – who has suggested that UK aid should “do more to serve the political and commercial interests” of Britain. With the Davos-y zeal that is the hallmark of what might be called the business-development complex, Blair suggests – like some latterday Milo Minderbinder out of Catch 22 – that what’s good for Britain plc inevitably will be good for African countries. Blair’s is a “great game” kind of spin, talking up the “fresh competition for influence in Africa”. All of which is true as far as it goes (which isn’t very far, or fresh) and only credible if you are the kind of romantic optimist who believes that a non-league team has a chance of winning the FA cup while 7-0 down to Man City at half time. What Blair’s argument conveniently ignores is that other and more powerful players have long been in this game, prominent among them China which has poured billions into pursuing just this influence, while more recently Russia has used the deployment of mercenaries and military aid as leverage to the same end. But it is where Blair ties his ambitions to development goals that he is on perhaps the shakiest ground with its emphasis on the “transformative” power of private investment. “The unequivocal demand I hear from African leaders,” he says, reminding us of his access to those African leaders, “is for investment that will spur the industrialisation of the continent and eradicate poverty – a pressing challenge, given the population growth and the fourth industrial revolution.” And while superficially, at least, Blair’s nostrum is an appealing one, the problem is that its promises have not only been largely overtaken by the harsh reality of facts on the ground, but proved hazardous as well. Let’s begin with the sugar coating on this prospect, the notion of a “fourth industrial revolution” that will eradicate poverty even as Africa’s population surges in the coming decades. The premise of its promoters is that, with their potential for a vast, young and untapped workforce, African countries can replicate the miracle of the east-Asian tiger economies during their emergence. The catch, according to a compelling school of thought, is that this is unlikely to take place. Unit costs for production on the African continent, for a variety of reasons, remain uncompetitively high and supply chains are too slow. Moves towards automation and cost cutting in the established tiger economies, say the same voices, make it likely that any fourth industrial revolution will be a technological one that skips Africa entirely, unfair as that seems. And the harsh truth is that far from promising an economic miracle which Britain can cash in on as it exits Europe, the outlook on the African continent is not a rosy one. The money that China has gifted to African countries in recent years means that, far from enjoying an economic renaissance, the continent may be on the brink of a painful new debt crisis. Replicating the last debt crisis in the 1990s – when high commodity prices fuelled a borrowing spree that became unaffordable as those same commodity prices collapsed – the only difference this time round is that, with the current debt held in more opaque circumstances, it will be far harder to forgive than at the successful culmination of the Drop the Debt campaign. As the International Monetary Fund’s managing director Kristalina Georgieva warned in November, echoing the World Bank’s own alarm, about 40% of countries on the continent have worrying levels of debt including Ethiopia, one of the success stories cited by Blair. It has not only been the IMF and World Bank ringing the warning bell. As the UN’s World Economic Situation and Prospects [WESP] report, published last week, makes clear, the global economy, and Africa in particular, faces serious challenges in the immediate future that not only cloud the medium-term economic outlook, but raise major questions over the achievability of the 2030 goal of poverty eradication in the sustainable development goals. Indeed, the continent’s most developed economy, South Africa, is expected to grow at just 0.7% this year and 1.1% in 2020 while leading oil exporter Nigeria will grow at 2.3% this year and 2.5% next. The reality – despite the fine words and window dressing – is that the UK-Africa investment summit has little to do with development and good governance in Africa, and everything to do with a diminished Britain desperately looking for new markets post-Brexit. And even then it feels like wishful thinking. As Nick Dearden, the director of Global Justice Now, pointed out in the wake of the summit’s announcement of some £6.5bn in new British investment: the “scramble for Africa” was carefully disguised as a humanitarian project. One hundred and fifty years later, what we saw at the UK-Africa summit today was a desperate and unseemly grab for markets, dressed up as ‘development’.” Pretending otherwise is just a grubby sleight of hand.",Global development; Africa; Tony Blair; China; Russia; Politics; World news,Global development
2019-10-16T06:00:13Z,How do we feed the world without destroying it? | Bob Geldof,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/oct/16/how-do-we-feed-the-world-without-destroying-the-planet,"Hunger is the most awful and profound expression of poverty. It exists in every country. It is something that most people can identify with on some perhaps primordial level. The fear of hunger is etched into our DNA, passed down the generations from hungry, scared ancestors. It is in our bones. It is in my Irish bones. First, the good news. For several decades global hunger has been decreasing. This is mostly thanks to the sweat and ingenuity of the 500 million smallholders who produce 80% of the food consumed in the developing world. It is also thanks to the work of exceptional NGOs, to economic growth and to the innovation of businesses all along the supply chain. It’s thanks, too, to the support of governments and international organisations. And to increased political stability in some places. But there is very bad news. More recently hunger has started to increase. Again. On World Food Day on Wednesday, 820 million people face chronic hunger. That’s the equivalent of the population of the US and the EU combined. This is daily, frightening, fatiguing, persistent hunger. Day after day, 820 million people will not get enough to eat. Night after night, famished mothers and fathers put their children to bed with empty stomachs. I suspect this shocks no one these days. Just as I suspect the spectre of climate crisis evokes yawns. Yet the two are inextricably linked in a kind of existential tango happening too slowly for us to register. The increase in global hunger is in part triggered by the climate emergency. There have been more floods, more droughts, and more frequent, fiercer storms. Small farmers are being hit first and hardest as once-in-a-century extreme weather events become almost routine. At the same time food production is a major cause of climate change, whether it be the methane gas production of cows or the tearing down of forests to grow crops. So, humanity faces a profound challenge. How do we feed the world without destroying it? From next year there will only be 10 years left to achieve the sustainable development goals established by UN member states. If these goals are to be more than bureaucratic niceties and political platitudes, there must be immediate and powerful action to stop the goal of zero hunger going into reverse. The German government aims to catalyse the global response. Next June it will host an international event to push for action to boost agriculture and tackle hunger in low-income countries, while staying within the environmental boundaries that our planet can cope with. More power to them. Those who attend will need to confront the challenge of underperforming agricultural development and the weaknesses of the international system. That means getting hard cash to the smallholder farmers who are too often bypassed by funding that goes either to governments or big business. It means leveraging government and private investment all along the supply chain and learning from what works and what doesn’t. The Global Agriculture and Food Security Programme, which we successfully fought for alongside President Obama, will be critical. It has resulted in a decade of experience in encouraging increased impact from the international system in exactly the way we need. In the face of the dual challenges of climate change and hunger, it is perhaps more relevant today than at its inception. Whatever happens with Brexit, the German gathering will be an opportunity for us to come together to tackle one of the great 21st-century challenges. It’s a century that has stumbled to begin. It is finally taking shape, but is still a plastic thing. It will see mind-boggling technologies emerge and profound cultural shifts. But what’s the point if we can’t beat humanity’s oldest foe, hunger? Surely it is a modest thing to suggest that next year would be an excellent time to start doing just that.",Hunger; Global development; Sustainable development goals; Society; World news; Sustainable development; Agriculture; Environment; Science,Global development
2019-11-21T09:00:52Z,"Less than 10% of EU aid reaches world's poorest countries, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/nov/21/less-than-10-per-cent-of-eu-aid-reaches-worlds-poorest-countries-study-finds,"Less than 10% of EU aid money reaches the countries where it is most needed, according to a study that found levels of assistance had dropped for the second year running. The EU and its member states remain the biggest development donor group in the world – investing €71.9bn (£61bn) in 2018, more than half of global aid – but its contribution was 5.8% lower than in 2017, the European NGO network, Concord, found in its AidWatch report. Progress on meeting the UN target of spending 0.7% of gross national income on aid, laid down in 1970, has gone into reverse, said the group. Their research showed that aid decreased to 0.47% of the EU’s combined GNI last year, compared with 0.49% in 2017 and 0.51% in 2016. Only Sweden, Luxembourg, Denmark and the UK met the 0.7% commitment. The UK’s three main political parties have committed to retaining the aid target. Aid from five countries – Italy, Greece, Finland, Austria and Lithuania – decreased by 10%. “We are moving further away from the 2030 Agenda [for sustainable development],” said Luca De Fraia of ActionAid Italy. “Not only are we missing the target in terms of quantity, but also the quality of aid is lagging behind.” Despite a marginal rise in aid going to the least developed countries (from 0.11% in 2017 to 0.12% in 2018), 16 countries, among the poorest in the world, currently receive only 8% of EU funding, AidWatch found. Åsa Thomasson, from Concord Sweden, called on EU leaders to provide more aid and ensure it is used effectively to “make the biggest difference to people who are most marginalised, excluded or discriminated against and the poorest and most financially challenged countries”. The report noted progress on what can legitimately be recorded as aid. Some countries had included domestic spending on students, refugees or security in official figures. But such costs – like debt relief, interest repayments on loans, or assistance “tied” to the donor country – are categorised as “inflated aid”, since they do not necessarily contribute to development and are often funds that never leave the EU. This year’s report shows a 25% reduction in inflated aid, while refugee costs decreased by approximately 35% and the use of aid for debt relief dropped by 66%. Jan van de Poel, policy and advocacy manager at the European Network on Debt and Development, said he was concerned that the commission is overestimating the potential for “blended finance” (linking aid with loans from publicly-owned institutions or commercial lenders) to help achieve the sustainable development goals. He pointed out that, as recently as 2016, more than half of all reported contracts were still awarded to firms in the donor country. “Donors not only need to untie all aid, but also make sure that their procurement practices are tailored towards the private sector in developing countries,” he said. Claire Godfrey, interim director of policy, advocacy and research at Bond, the UK development network, praised the Department for International Development (DfID) for maintaining the 0.7% pledge and ensuring that the majority of its aid reached the people who need it the most. She added that other EU countries needed to “step up to the plate”. Godfrey said DfID would ideally have oversight of all UK aid, rather than multiple departments, since this would “ensure not a single penny is diverted away from the poorest, most vulnerable and most marginalised”. With a general election looming, Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have all stated their commitment to retaining the 0.7% aid target, equating to roughly £14bn, while the Green party said they would raise it to 1% – in line with Sweden. At a joint hustings event on women’s rights and sustainable development held by ActionAid UK and the Overseas Development Institute on Monday, Lord Ray Collins pledged that Labour would triple funding to grassroots women’s groups in the global south. Elizabeth Babade, candidate for the Brexit party in Warrington North, said her party would cut the foreign aid budget but declined to say by how much. The Conservative party did not put forward a candidate for the event, but restated its commitment to the 0.7% target in the House of Commons earlier this month. It stopped short, however, of committing to the retention of DfID as a separate department to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The UN Conference on Trade and Development’s Least developed countries report, also published this week, called on the world’s poorest nations to ensure external finance from all sources is “directed to national development priorities” as the best way to “manage their aid dependency and eventually escape it”.",Aid; Global development; European Union; Politics; Europe; World news; UK news; Society,Global development
2019-12-27T07:00:35Z,'Everybody is talking about it': women's rights to take centre stage in 2020,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/dec/27/everybody-is-talking-about-it-womens-rights-to-take-centre-stage-in-2020,"World leaders, civil society and the private sector are preparing to make 2020 the biggest year yet for the advancement of women’s rights. Over the course of the year, thousands of people are expected to attend high-level UN events and forums in Mexico City and Paris to mark the 25th anniversary of the Beijing platform for action, a landmark agreement to end gender inequality. More than 160 countries have already submitted reports outlining the progress made and the obstacles faced in achieving the Beijing agreement. In January, the UN secretary general is expected to publish an assessment of global efforts, and member states are already negotiating ways to accelerate action. Global gatherings for gender equality, convened by UN Women – which has launched its own Generation Equality campaign – and co-hosted by the governments of Mexico and France, will be held in May and July. Governments, women’s rights activists and businesses are expected to form coalitions to agree fully-funded action plans on abortion rights, ending violence and other specific issues. “2020 is going to be massive, and the potential [for change] is enormous,” said Katja Iversen, president and CEO of Women Deliver, a global advocacy group for women’s rights. “Everybody is talking about it. A lot of people are talking about how to get in on the act.” Iversen cautioned, however, that the year “has to end in strong action”. “We can’t have empty commitments again. We need big, bold, accountable commitments and action. If that doesn’t happen after this year, we will all lose tremendously.” The Beijing platform for action was adopted unanimously by 189 governments at the UN’s fourth world conference on women, held in China in 1995. It is considered the most progressive international blueprint for advancing women’s rights. It covered 12 key areas. These included eliminating violence against women, ensuring all women have access to family planning and the reproductive healthcare they need, removing barriers to women’s participation in decision-making, and providing decent jobs and equal pay for equal work. The declaration urged governments to assess the impact of environmental degradation on women, and called for indigenous women to be given an equal say in sustainable development. It also recognised the disproportionate burden of unpaid care that falls on women and called for a better portrayal and representation of women in the media. A quarter of a century on, however, no country has achieved gender equality, and the Beijing agenda is being undermined by growing conservative populist movements that seek to roll back women’s rights. The Trump administration has taken a leading role in the pushback. There has been some progress but, globally, one in three women are still expected to experience sexual or physical violence in their lifetime, women are paid less than men for doing the same work, and they continue to bear a disproportionate burden of unpaid care work. Hundreds of thousands of women still die each year from complications in pregnancy and childbirth, and less than a quarter of MPs are women. Françoise Girard, president of the International Women’s Health Coalition, said 2020 is a “key moment to gather and push [the Beijing agenda] forward”. “We are very engaged in the Beijing+25 anniversary work. It’s a moment where governments are going to negotiate a new agenda,” she said. As well as fighting for “issues that remain difficult”, such as abortion rights, body autonomy and sexual orientation, Girard said the anniversary offered a chance to push for action on issues “that have really developed since Beijing”. These include the impact of the climate crisis on women, targeted support for female refugees, and the impact of sexual violence at work on women’s economic participation. “We’re now understanding the impact that has had in keeping women back in the workplace”, said Girard. She added that activists will be calling on governments to afford greater protection to female human rights defenders, and to take more seriously online harassment and mental health issues. “There’s lots [of areas] that we have come to understand in the past 25 years that were mentioned in Beijing but not all were developed. We’re eager to bring these to the fore.” As well as the Beijing anniversary, next year will mark two decades since UN security council resolution 1325 first acknowledged women’s unique experience of conflict and their lack of involvement in peace negotiations. Nine subsequent resolutions have been passed. Anniversary events are being planned for October and activists will be steeling themselves for the introduction of any new resolution. In April, heavy lobbying by the US resulted in the removal of key language around sexual and reproductive health and rights from a resolution introduced by Germany. Next year also kicks off the 10-year countdown to achieve the UN sustainable development goals, which includes a commitment to end gender inequality by 2030. “These are all extremely important to advance women’s rights,” said Dinah Musindarwezo, director of policy and communications at Womankind Worldwide, a global organisation supporting women’s rights groups in Africa and Asia. She said she hoped 2020 would mark the coming together of feminist groups to create a strong, global movement for change. “It’s a crucial year because we see it as a year where we can come together and accelerate the promotion of women’s rights and gender equality,” said Musindarwezo. “Twenty-five years is a long time to wait to achieve the commitments our governments have made,” she added. “We can’t wait another 25 years.”",Women's rights and gender equality; Global development; World news; Women; Life and style; Gender,Global development
2019-10-14T23:01:36Z,Higher temperatures driving 'alarming' levels of hunger – report,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/oct/15/higher-temperatures-driving-alarming-levels-hunger-report-climate-crisis,"The climate crisis is driving alarming levels of hunger in the world, undermining food security in the world’s most vulnerable regions, according to this year’s global hunger index. The annual report, a ranking of 117 countries measuring hunger rates and trends, shows progress since 2000, but warns that the world still has a long way to go to reach the zero hunger target agreed by world leaders by 2030. The report is published as a series of committee on world food security meetings take place in Rome in the run-up to World Food Day on 16 October. The findings show levels of hunger are “serious” or “alarming” in 47 countries, and “extremely alarming” in one: the Central African Republic. Rates are categorised as “alarming” in Chad, Madagascar, Yemen and Zambia. Nine countries have worse scores today than in 2010 – the Central African Republic, Madagascar, Venezuela, Yemen, Jordan, Malaysia, Mauritania, Lebanon and Oman. Data is lacking for several countries – Burundi, Comoros, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Libya, Papua New Guinea, Somalia, South Sudan and Syria. The authors acknowledge an overall global decline in poverty and increased funding for nutrition but argue that current action and spending will not meet the global sustainable development goals or World Health Assembly nutrition targets. Dominic MacSorley, CEO of Concern Worldwide, co-sponsors of the report with Welthungerhilfe, said that progress towards the zero hunger by 2030 goal is now “under threat or is being reversed”. “Approximately 45 countries are set to fail to achieve low levels of hunger by 2030,” he said. “Conflict, inequality, and the effects of climate change have all contributed to persistently high levels of hunger and food insecurity around the world.” The report finds that the number of undernourished people across the globe is increasing. The rise has been biggest in countries in Africa that are south of the Sahara and affected by conflict and drought. Extreme weather events are putting food production and security in jeopardy and the risk is expected to increase. Food production is likely to fall due to higher temperatures, water scarcity, greater CO2 and extreme weather events. Yields of maize and wheat are already declining. It is estimated that the global food system contributes 21–37% of total human-related emissions. Loss of food after harvesting and before reaching the retail level is estimated at 14% globally, meaning a proportion of food production is likely to exacerbate the climate emergency without even contributing towards food security or nutrition. Current climate commitments are projected to result in warming of 3–4C by 2100, and increased climate pressures could lead to further conflict, according to the report. The authors conclude that what is needed is a profound shift toward sustainability, with changes in values and behaviours and a fairer global balance of power. In her foreword, the former president of Ireland, Mary Robinson, said: “With the number of hungry people rising from 785 million in 2015 to 822 million in 2018, we can no longer afford to regard the 2030 agenda and the Paris climate agreement as voluntary and a matter for each member state to decide on its own.” Instead, she called for “the full implementation” of both to secure “a liveable world for our children and grandchildren”. “This requires a change of mindset at the global political level,” she added. Responding to the report, Lawrence Haddad, executive director of the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition, said that the poor quality of diets is at the heart of malnutrition and also has a critical impact on greenhouse gas emissions and natural resource use. He too believes that global systems must be reformed, with nutritious foods simply out of reach for billions of people, “either because they are not available or are too expensive”. “To change this we need to transform the food systems that low and middle-income people depend on – and that means supporting the growth of small and medium food businesses that already produce and market nutritious foods,” he said.",Global development; Climate crisis; Food security; Hunger; Sustainable development goals; Sustainable development; Food,Global development
2019-11-02T07:00:15Z,British government takes global lead on violence against women and girls,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/nov/02/british-government-takes-global-lead-on-violence-against-women-and-girls,"Britain has become the biggest government funder of programmes to prevent violence against women and girls globally after launching a seven-year project targeting countries with some of the highest levels of abuse. The £67.5m programme will scale up projects that have already shown success in reducing violence across Africa and Asia, and will pilot and research new ideas to tackle the global crisis. According to the World Health Organization, one in three women worldwide will experience physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetime, mostly from an intimate partner. But this global figure masks regional and national disparities. A survey conducted in Zambia showed that 64% of women said they had been sexually assaulted by their partner and 33% had been kicked, dragged, choked or burned. In South Sudan, a country experiencing a protracted humanitarian crisis, as many as 70% of women and girls who had been in a relationship said they had experienced some form of violence. Launched by the Department for International Development (DfID) on Saturday, the programme – What Works to Prevent Violence: Impact at Scale – builds on a previous initiative, launched in 2014, that gathered evidence about the scale and impact of violence against women and girls, and ways to stop it. The £25m programme supported 13 small-scale projects in Africa and Asia – ranging from couples’ counselling in Rwanda, to introducing school play time in Pakistan – as well as research into the drivers, prevalence, and social and economic costs of violence. Before the scheme, there was little evidence internationally on how to tackle violence in poorer countries. A number of these pilot programmes helped to halve levels of physical and sexual violence in less than two years. In Tajikistan, visited by the Guardian last year, levels of violence against women in two regions fell from 64% to 34% following 10 weeks of counselling, skills training and mentoring. The percentage of men who said they were violent fell from 47% to 5%. Suicide rates among women in these regions fell from 20% before the project to 9% after, and for men, rates fell from from 10% to nil. Women’s earnings increased. Fifteen months after the project ended, the successful gains were still evident. Meanwhile, a project in the Democratic Republic of the Congo that trained faith leaders to challenge abuse in their sermons reduced domestic violence by nearly 60% in 15 villages over two years. “Violence against women and girls affects communities around the world and one in every three women will experience it in their lifetime. It is an issue we must continue to tackle in both developing and developed countries,” said the international development secretary, Alok Sharma. “However, for women and girls living in extreme poverty the threat is even higher. Failure to address this issue is not an option and doing nothing condemns future generations to repeat this cycle of violence.” More than £33m of the new funding will be spent on expanding these successful projects, and adjusting and testing them in new locations. Another £10m will be used to design and pilot new ideas and programmes, particularly to research how violence can be tackled in times of conflict and during humanitarian crises, where levels of domestic violence increase. DfID also wants to pilot programmes that specifically target violence against adolescent girls and among people with disabilities, and address violence against children to stop it being passed down through generations. DfID will target countries in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, north Africa and the Middle East. The department hopes the success of What Works will spur other donors to fund similar programmes that aim to prevent violence. Charlotte Watts, DfID’s chief scientific adviser, said: “People think it’s going to take generations, but what’s so powerful about What Works is that it is not only showing we are preventing violence, but that these impacts are being achieved over two to three years. Strong evidence gives us the tools to argue the importance of investing in prevention.” UN member states have committed to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls by 2030, a hugely ambitious target of the sustainable development goals. But Watts maintains: “We are generating evidence that will clearly contribute to how we get there [to SDG target]. We are seeing declines in violence in some contexts. It will be country by country … Wherever we are by then [2030], we will be generating evidence to help us get further. “We want to get to zero [levels of violence] … this will really help us get there.”",Women's rights and gender equality; Sexual violence; Department for International Development (DfID); Global development; UK news; World news,Global development

The IMF said governments worried about a political backlash against big increases in the cost of heating homes and motoring, and should use the extra revenue raised from the tax to compensate consumers. “To limit global warming to 2C or less – the level deemed safe by science – large emitting countries need to take ambitious action,” IMF economists said. “For example, they should introduce a carbon tax set to rise quickly to $75 a ton in 2030. This would mean household electric bills would go up by 43% cumulatively over the next decade on average – more in countries that still rely heavily on coal in electricity generation, less elsewhere. Gasoline would cost 14% more on average.” Calculations by the IMF’s economists show that a $75-a-ton carbon tax would also lead – once inflation has been taken into account – to an average 214% increase in the cost of coal and a 68% increase in natural gas. For the UK, the increases would be 157% for coal, 51% for natural gas, 43% for electricity and 8% for petrol. Details of the IMF’s call for a much higher carbon tax came in a chapter from the organisation’s biannual fiscal monitor released before its publication next week. “Without substantial mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, global temperatures are projected to rise by around 4C above preindustrial levels by 2100 (they have already increased by 1C since 1900),” the IMF said. “Global warming causes major damage to the global economy and the natural world and engenders risk of catastrophic and irreversible outcomes such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events (already more frequent) leading to loss of life and the possibility of much higher warming scenarios.” The IMF said it was calling for a substantially higher carbon tax because the carbon dioxide from fossil fuels accounted for almost two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions and was the most immediately practical to control. But the authors of the fiscal monitor said that without compensation to offset the impact on business and consumers, there was likely to be strong political resistance. The French president Emmanuel Macron’s attempt to cut France’s CO2 emissions through higher fuel prices prompted nationwide protests from the gilets jaunes (yellow vest) movement. A blog post by the authors to accompany the chapter from the fiscal monitor said global heating was a clear and present threat. Actions to date had fallen short of what was required, and finance ministers needed to play a pivotal role in dealing with the problem. “A better future is possible. Governments will need to increase the price of carbon emissions to give people and firms incentives to reduce energy use and shift to clean energy sources. Carbon taxes are the most powerful and efficient tools, but only if they are implemented in a fair and growth-friendly way. “To make carbon taxes politically feasible and economically efficient, governments need to choose how to use the new revenue. Options include cutting other kinds of taxes, supporting vulnerable households and communities, increasing investment in green energy or simply returning the money to people as a dividend.” The IMF economists said governments could target financial help directly at workers and communities disproportionately affected by the carbon tax instead of paying a flat-rate dividend to everybody. Restricting compensation to the poorest 40% of households would leave three-quarters of the revenue from the carbon tax for investment in green energy, innovation or to fund the UN’s anti-poverty 2030 sustainable development goals. While about 50 countries currently have a carbon pricing scheme in some form, the IMF said the global average carbon price of $2 a ton was far below what the planet needed. It said other countries could learn from Sweden, which has a carbon tax of $127 per ton and has managed to reduce emissions 25% since 1995, while the economy has expanded by 75%.",Carbon tax; Business; Environment; Climate crisis; Energy; Fossil fuels,Environment
2019-07-15T17:28:36Z,"World hunger on the rise as 820m at risk, UN report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/15/world-hunger-un-report,"More than 820 million people worldwide are still going hungry, according to a UN report that says reaching the target of zero hunger by 2030 is “an immense challenge”. The number of people with not enough to eat has risen for the third year in a row as the population increases, after a decade when real progress was made. The underlying trend is stabilisation, when global agencies had hoped it would fall. Millions of children are not getting the nutrition they need. The UN says the pace of progress in halving child stunting and reducing the number of low birthweight babies is too slow, which jeopardises the chances of achieving another of the sustainable development goals. The report is from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the UN Children’s Fund (Unicef), the World Food Programme and the World Health Organization. While hunger remains widespread, obesity – also related to malnutrition – continues to rise in all regions. There are 338 million school-age children and adolescents who are overweight and 672 million obese adults. Asia and Africa, which have nine out of 10 of all stunted children and more than nine out of 10 of all wasted children worldwide, are also home to nearly three-quarters of all overweight children worldwide, largely driven by unhealthy diets. One in seven babies around the world were born with low birthweight in 2015, the report says, many of them to adolescent mothers. That puts them at risk of poor development. The world’s population has steadily grown, with most people living in urban areas. Technology has “evolved at a dizzying pace, while the economy has become increasingly interconnected and globalised”, say the heads of the UN agencies in a foreword to the report. “Many countries, however, have not witnessed sustained growth as part of this new economy. The world economy as a whole is not growing as much as expected.” Climate breakdown is affecting agriculture and the number of farmers has declined. “All of this has led to major shifts in the way in which food is produced, distributed and consumed worldwide – and to new food security, nutrition and health challenges.” Hunger is increasing in countries where economic growth is lagging and there is income inequality. “Our actions to tackle these troubling trends will have to be bolder,” the UN leaders say. “We must foster pro-poor and inclusive structural transformation focusing on people and placing communities at the centre to reduce economic vulnerabilities and set ourselves on track to ending hunger, food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition.”",United Nations; Hunger; Malnutrition; Sustainable development goals; Children; Health; World news; Science; Society; World Health Organization,World news
2020-03-11T04:30:52Z,‘We used to be leaders’: the collapse of New Zealand’s landmark ocean park,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/11/we-used-to-be-leaders-the-collapse-of-new-zealands-landmark-ocean-park,"Tiritiri Matangi is one of the jewels of New Zealand’s Hauraki Gulf. For the past 35 years the island, which is within sight of Auckland’s skyscrapers, has been a protected nature reserve. Step ashore and you’re enveloped in birdsong: kiwi and takahē thrive here, and vegetation envelops the cliffs to the sea. But beneath the waves it’s a different story. “It was solid kelp forest, beautiful ecklonia, crayfish bristling out of every crevice,” marine biologist Roger Grace, who started diving here in the early 1960s, told me shortly before he died last year. Now, the kelp and the crays are almost gone. The bare rock is overgrazed by sea urchins, or kina, which flourish in the absence of snapper and crayfish, their natural predators. The entire seascape is an impoverished and degraded landscape. “People just don’t realise what’s happened before their eyes, because it’s out of sight,” Grace had said. “Unless there are some radical changes, it’s not going to get better.” In 2000, New Zealand established its first national park of the sea, the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park. Covering 13,900 sq km (5,370 sq mile), the park’s objective was to protect the gulf’s “life-supporting capacity”, its nature and its history. The legislation required the slew of local councils and government departments with jurisdiction over the gulf to consider these objectives in planning or fisheries decisions. However, with the exception of a handful of tiny marine reserves, commercial and recreational fishing was allowed to continue throughout the entire gulf. Twenty years later, the creation of the park has failed to prevent ecosystem collapse. Last week the government body charged with administering the park, the Hauraki Gulf Forum, released a report highlighting what had changed over those two decades. “It certainly hasn’t lived up to the vision we all had, which was a thriving and healthy Hauraki Marine Park,” says Nicola MacDonald, the Māori co-chair of the forum. “Our taonga [treasure] is dying.” It remains legal to drag dredges and trawls across the sea floor, even recreationally, and no-take marine reserves have increased just 0.05% in two decades, to 0.3% of the Hauraki park. Crayfish are functionally extinct in most of the gulf: the few that are left play no meaningful role in the ecosystem, for example in keeping urchin numbers down. Kina barrens – those forests of sea urchins – are proliferating. In 2019, after dramatic declines in the commercial crayfish take, the government slashed the daily recreational quota from six crayfish to three. Most divers are lucky to even find one. The snapper population is down to about 20% of what scientists calculate pre-fishing numbers would have been. Lifelong fishermen report the virtual disappearance of baitfish such as anchovies and pilchards. In 2000, 4% of the seabird species in the gulf were threatened with extinction. Today, 22% are. Spotted shags, which once flourished in their tens of thousands, are down to 300 pairs; scientists suspect a lack of food. On Auckland’s beaches, stormwater and sewage overflows make 38% of the 50 monitored sites frequently unsafe to swim. Three sites are never safe to swim. The dairy industry is another disruptive factor. The nearby Hauraki Plains are New Zealand’s dairy heartland, and despite efforts by farmers to fence off waterways and plant trees, the rivers still pump fertiliser and effluent – and 3,730 tonnes of nitrogen – into the gulf each year. High nitrate levels lead to algal blooms and ocean acidification. Some estuaries are badly affected by sediment flows. Human settlements are growing, too – faster around the gulf than anywhere else in New Zealand. Land clearing has caused sediment to collect elbow-deep in some estuaries, choking delicate organisms. Critics say this is all the more upsetting given New Zealand’s past role as a marine-protection trailblazer. The country is unlikely to meet its commitment under the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) to conserve at least 10% of coastal and marine areas by this year, let alone contribute to the global push to protect 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030. The minister for conservation, Eugenie Sage, admits the government won’t meet the SDG target this year. “Overseas, we’ve seen visionary initiatives by some of our Pacific neighbours – Palau, the Cook Islands – to extend marine protected areas,” Sage says. “We are a long way back, and that’s really disappointing.” “We had the first no-take marine reserves in the world. What happened to that leadership position?” says James Frankham, the publisher of New Zealand Geographic magazine. “We’re 20 years on from our landmark national park of the sea, and it’s crashing.” Frankham, 45, grew up sailing, fishing and diving in the gulf, watching the water roil as seabirds plunged among kahawai and kingfish. Last week he came away fuming from an event run jointly by the department of conservation and Auckland council, commemorating the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park’s 20th anniversary. “I don’t come to outrage very easily as a person, but I was outraged by the lack of political action [being planned to address the issue]. “I’ve seen incredible change over my lifetime in the Hauraki Gulf, and my father and grandfather had stories [of an abundance of biodiversity] that were equally preposterous to me as the stories I’m telling my children today. It’s really heartbreaking. I can’t describe it as anything other than a collapse.” Simon Thrush, head of the Institute of Marine Science at the University of Auckland, says the decline in animal populations is extremely concerning, although there is still time to turn things around. “You can think of these collapses [in biodiversity] as a series of ratchets. It’s not a waterfall that’s 100 feet high and it tumbles off the top and smashes on the cliffs at the bottom. It comes down in steps. We can still stop it falling off the next step.” He argued for immediate action on every problem at once: more marine reserves, a halt to trawling and dredging, and more efforts by developers and farmers to keep sediment out of the gulf. Although more research is necessary, too, he called for action on the studies already done: for example, his research in the 1990s demonstrated the negative biodiversity effects of bottom-impacting fishing gear, but fisheries management has not adapted to the problem. “We need agencies to not just commission another report and have another meeting, but to do something,” he says. “We need citizens to vote appropriately. We want as many people as we can to stick their thumb in the dike.” There have been some positive developments. A voluntary speed limit for container ships of 10 knots has effectively eliminated whale collisions. The creation of the island sanctuaries, such as Tiritiri Matangi, appears to have reduced mammalian pests. Commercial longline fishers are collaborating with NGOs and the government to reduce seabird by-catch, including trialling a device to bait lines underwater so birds don’t get caught in them. Community and local Māori groups are reintroducing native species to the islands, removing old moorings from bays and seeding juvenile mussels, which act as natural water purifiers. Auckland council, meanwhile, admits many building sites haven’t complied with sediment control regulations and is trialling new ways to enforce them. Stricter rules for farmers aimed at curbing run-off will come into force this year. In 2016, a report titled SeaChange – a collective effort from a diverse group of gulf users, including commercial and recreational fishers, Māori and conservationists – made ambitious recommendations to address these issues. This summer, four years later, a special government committee will finally report on which to adopt. In the past, however, commercial and recreational fishers have blocked many protection efforts. “In the marine space there are many who assert their rights and fewer who assert their responsibilities,” says Sage, the minister for conservation. “Any change is hotly contested, and I hope now that people realise how serious it is and how urgent. Our shared goal must surely be a healthy Hauraki Gulf. I hope people are putting aside their individual interests on behalf of the common purpose of restoring the mauri [life force] of the gulf.” “The one thing that everyone around the table wants is a return to abundance – but the means of getting there is going to hurt,” Frankham says. “If we could have taken an aspirin 20 years ago, we’re on to chemotherapy now.” “It’s critical if we’re going to argue that we’re truly a sustainable nation,” Thrush says. “The Hauraki Gulf is an exemplar of how we manage what most of New Zealand is – ocean.”",Environment; New Zealand; Asia Pacific; Fishing; Conservation; Marine life; Wildlife; Food,Environment
2020-01-05T14:22:47Z,Another groundhog year of Brexit will usher in a decade of disruption | Richard Partington,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/05/another-groundhog-year-brexit-decade-disruption-productivity,"At the outset of the 2020s, the UK economy embarks on a new decade with little momentum. Growth has stalled, not least because Brexit uncertainty and a slowdown in the global economy has served as a handbrake on business investment. Meanwhile, consumers have begun tightening their belts and the job market boom of the past decade has petered out. For at least the duration of 2020 another groundhog year awaits thanks to the ongoing Brexit saga, despite the promise Boris Johnson made before the election. But as the economist Mat Lawrence has argued, Brexit is just the firing gun on a wider decade of disruption. The prime minister will not be able to declare the job done and his mission accomplished after the UK’s formal exit later this month. Instead it will mark the first steps towards redefining the nation’s place in a rapidly-changing world. In a prescient report for the Institute for Public Policy Research three years ago, Lawrence outlined five powerful trends that will drive change in the 2020s: The aftershock of Brexit, a demographic tipping point from an ageing society, the rise of new technologies, a shifting global economic order and the existential threat of global heating. These trends aside, much about the coming decade will be tough to predict from today’s vantage point. Johnson says his 10-year plan for Britain will usher in a “new golden age”. Yet, some on the left think Labour could remove him from office in half the time. Donald Trump could be deposed this year. Rising tension in the Middle East could spark a fresh Gulf war, sending oil prices soaring.. One hope in the wake of the election is that the decade ahead will not lead to another 10 years of crippling austerity. The British state is set to grow, with spending as a share of national income due to rise under Johnson’s Tories to 1970s levels according to the Resolution Foundation. This shift is vital to begin the lengthy job of fixing the battered public realm. But the 2020s will still be largely defined by the cost-cutting of the past given the extent of the harm it caused. Britain has three primary economic problems to address from the outset, all arguably made far worse by the spending constraint of the 2010s. First will be to reboot the flatlining productivity growth of the 2010s. Second is the task of rebalancing a fractured nation, by addressing inequalities of wealth, gender, race, education, geography and opportunity. Third will be to decarbonise the UK’s economic model, to prevent the climate emergency from turning into catastrophe. Johnson will need to address each point while also taking on the complex task of redrawing Britain’s trading relationships with the EU, as well as striking new trade deals with other countries. All this comes as the economic world order of the past century faces substantial change that will shape the coming decade for Britain. Asia’s GDP is expected to overtake that of the rest of the world this year, while China could replace the US as the planet’s largest economy by the end of the decade. Asia at large is expected to contribute to roughly 60% of global economic growth by 2030, and should be home to almost all the world’s 2.4 billion new members of the middle class. Britain will fall down the international league table, according to the City bank Standard Chartered, out of the top 10 to rank behind nations such as India and Indonesia by 2030. The emergence of Asia as an economic powerhouse has so far been against a backdrop of ever increasing globalisation. But the 2010s probably marked the high point for the economic integration of recent decades. Trade policy uncertainty reached unprecedented levels in 2019. Phase one of a resolution in the US-China trade dispute that provided much of that uncertainty is expected next week, but economists expect the world to increasingly fragment over the next decade. At the same time as our economies look set to slip further apart, global heating and a new mass extinction mean greater political cooperation will be required to tackle the climate emergency. Amid these competing forces, there are warnings from the World Bank that doing nothing could mean climate impacts pushing an additional 100 million people into poverty by 2030. The poorest regions of the world – Sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia – are expected to be hit the hardest, prompting a migration crisis as people flee increasingly extreme weather events. To respond to the threat, the decade ahead will be pivotal. World leaders have targeted the 2020s as a “decade of delivery” to reach the UN’s sustainable development goals – 17 targets to eliminate extreme poverty, cut inequalities and combat the climate emergency – adopted by the UN general assembly to hit by 2030. Progress is being made, but much more needs to be done. A major risk will be that countries get distracted from the task by another global recession. Given rising geopolitical tensions, and the simple fact that national recessions tend to take place roughly ever ten years, the chances are rising. For the US, the current expansion is the longest on record, while in the UK the 2010s marked the first decade since reliable records began – in the 1700s - in which recession was completely avoided. Either way economists expect growth over the 2020s in wealthy nations to be much slower than average in the decades before the 2008 financial crisis amid an ongoing demographic shift. Working-age populations are expected to shrink, including in the UK, where the number of over 85-year-olds is projected to almost double in the next 25 years – raising questions for growth and the funding of public services. There are hopes that technological advances could address both the demographic shift and the climate emergency. But like a common thread running through these issues facing Britain in the 2020s, greater government coordination and funding will be required to realise the ambition. Central banks head into the 2020s with interest rates close to, at, or below zero, meaning that the effectiveness of tweaking interest rates to stimulate demand is effectively neutered. Andrew Bailey will have an important role to play to continue the work of Mark Carney at the Bank of England, becoming governor for eight years of the 2020s starting in March, but low inflation and lack of room for manoeuvre mean the government must take the primary role. Voters are increasingly fed up with kick-the-can policymaking. At the outset of the 2020s, Britain and the world are entering a disruption decade. • Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk.",Economic policy; Economic growth (GDP); Business; Productivity; Climate crisis; Brexit; Economics; International trade,Business
2019-09-19T14:48:54Z,Number of women dying in childbirth way off track to meet worldwide targets,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/sep/19/number-women-dying-childbirth-off-track,"The number of women dying in pregnancy and childbirth has fallen by more than a third since 2000, according to new UN figures, but the rate of decline remains way off track to meet global targets to cut maternal deaths. In the US maternal death rates have increased by over 50% and progress in reducing deaths in the 10 countries with the highest rates has slowed since 2000. Figures published on Thursday show that in 2017 an estimated 295,000 women died from complications in pregnancy and childbirth, compared with 451,000 at the turn of the century. Globally, the maternal mortality ratio – the number of deaths per 100,000 live births – now stands at 211, compared with 342 in 2000. While the decrease was welcomed, there are concerns that the slow pace of change means reaching the target in the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) of no more than 70 deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030, would be unlikely. The pace of decline since 2015, when the SDGs were agreed, has been particularly slow. Poverty, inadequate and sometimes expensive health services and a lack of political will are among the main reasons for the deaths, which are often preventable with the right care. Anneka Knutsson, chief of the UN population fund (UNFPA) sexual and reproductive branch, said: “Although it’s true that more women and children are surviving today, the slight decrease in maternal deaths between 2015 and 2017 is deeply concerning.” The new statistics, she said, suggested the SDG target would not be reached “unless we dramatically increase and accelerate our efforts to improve maternal health care by bolstering overall sexual and reproductive healthcare”. “I think this new statistic should alarm us all,” she said. “Also, the new number hides the fact that huge inequalities still exist between and within countries. We also know that lack of quality care is a major killer. We simply must do better. We need to be accountable.” The figures, published by the World Health Organization, the UNFPA, the UN children’s agency (Unicef) the World Bank and the UN Population Division, are based on data collated from countries with populations of more than 100,000, plus Puerto Rico and the West Bank and Gaza. The UN said collecting accurate data remained a challenge in countries with inadequate reporting systems, which means the actual figures are likely to be higher. Two-thirds of deaths still occur in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2017, the estimated number of deaths in the region was 196,000, compared with 201,000 in 2015. In Europe the figure is 740. The MMR for sub-Saharan Africa is 542, compared with 10 in Europe. In South Sudan, Chad, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Central African Republic, Somalia, Mauritania, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Afghanistan – the 10 countries with the highest maternal mortality ratio (MMR) – the annual rates of reduction are stagnating or slowing. The US has seen maternal deaths rise from 12 per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 19 in 2017. Southern Asia has made the greatest strides in maternal survival with a nearly 60% reduction in the MMR since 2000. But India, along with Nigeria, accounted for a third of global maternal deaths in 2017. A conference in November, organised by the UNFPA and the Kenyan and Danish governments, will be calling on governments to increase their efforts to end preventable maternal deaths. On Thursday, the UN also published data that showed child deaths had been cut by almost half between 1990 and 2018. The total number of under-five deaths fell to 5.3 million in 2018 from 12.5 million in 1990. “Around the world, birth is a joyous occasion. Yet, every 11 seconds, a birth is a family tragedy,” said Henrietta Fore, Unicef’s executive director. “A skilled pair of hands to help mothers and newborns around the time of birth, along with clean water, adequate nutrition, basic medicines and vaccines, can make the difference between life and death. We must do all it takes to invest in universal health coverage to save these precious lives.”",Maternal mortality; Maternal health; Global development; Health; Women; Life and style; World news; Society; US news; Women's health,Global development
2019-09-19T12:44:03Z,Commonwealth ministers look to revitalise progress on gender equality,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/sep/19/commonwealth-ministers-look-to-revitalise-progress-on-gender-equality,"Ministers from across the Commonwealth are meeting in Kenya this week to discuss ways to accelerate efforts to end gender inequality. Gender and women’s affairs ministers from 53 states will explore the gains and the gaping holes in progress in several key areas, including women in leadership, ending violence and increasing access to family planning services. In June, a global report found that no country in the world was on track to achieve gender equality by the UN-agreed 2030 deadline. Decisions from the two-day meeting, which begins in Nairobi on Thursday, will feed into a wider Commonwealth strategy designed to end inequality and meet the 17 UN sustainable development goals (SDGs). The strategy will be adopted at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting next year. The secretary general of the Commonwealth, Lady Patricia Scotland, said this week’s meeting offered “an immensely valuable opportunity for our member countries collectively to monitor and evaluate progress towards achieving Commonwealth priorities”. The Commonwealth’s annual report on gender equality, expected to be published later this year, shows existing efforts are not effecting significant, lasting change. Despite improvements in maternal health, primary education and women’s participation in the labour force in Commonwealth states, there is still a dearth of women in political leadership. Only Rwanda has achieved gender parity in its parliament, with women making up more than 60% of MPs in the lower house. Just 12 other Commonwealth countries have parliaments where more than 30% of MPs are women. Despite a greater presence in the workforce, women remain more likely than men to work in the informal sector, while huge gaps endure between the prevalence of gender-based violence across Commonwealth countries and the initiatives in place to tackle such abuse. The impact of climate crisis on women’s lives has also received relatively little attention. “The last 40 years, looking at the data, looking back where we were, most of us would say [we’ve not moved] fast enough,” Scotland told the Guardian before the conference. “But many of us can say it has changed. Are we on a progressive journey? Absolutely. We’re going forwards step by step.” The secretary general appears undaunted by the challenge of achieving consensus among a diverse mix of countries from Africa, Asia, the Americas, the Pacific and Europe – from liberal governments to the more religiously conservative. “One of the great things about the Commonwealth is it creates a platform for you to have very intense conversations, very practical conversations. The difference is we walk with people and create a framework within which those conversations can take place, looking at practical outcomes. We’re not talking to people, we’re talking with them … about practical things we can do.” Asked if it was possible to find common ground on the subject of women’s sexual and reproductive health among countries as different as Malta, which has a complete ban on abortion, and South Africa, which has some of the most liberal laws, the secretary general said it was about “understanding where each country is, and looking within the cultural context to find solutions compatible with both [agreements] they have signed on to in the Commonwealth, and their own religious beliefs”. While such an approach may seem inadequate in the face of increasing global pushback on women’s rights, Scotland is convinced it works. Last year, when there was “very little agreement between the G7 and G20” after two years of talking with officials, “every single leader agreed on everything” in the “very ambitious” communique that came out of the Commonwealth heads of government meeting – although the statement did tiptoe around the specific issue of upholding women’s reproductive rights with a pledge to ratify and implement the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Scotland believes making the economic case for improving women’s lives is increasingly winning over government officials. A much-cited report by McKinsey and Company from 2015 calculated at least $12tn (£9.6tn) could be added to the global economy by 2025 if women had more opportunities in the workplace. “I say to people: ‘Do you want to get rich?’” said Scotland. She stressed that any agreements made this week would be forwarded to finance, health and education ministers, to make sure there is money to back the commitments.",Women's rights and gender equality; Global development; Commonwealth of Nations; World news; Lady Scotland; Politics,Global development
2019-10-23T05:00:39Z,Lib Dems unveil plans for environmental 'duty of care' for UK firms,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/23/liberal-democrats-jo-swinson-plans-for-environmental-duty-of-care-for-uk-firms,"Businesses would be given a legal “duty of care” on environmental and social issues that could be used to prevent them selling goods from deforested areas and to force companies to investigate their overseas supply chains, under plans set out by the Liberal Democrat party. The requirement would mean even if British businesses were operating in line with the law in other countries, they could be found liable for environmental harm they or their suppliers caused overseas if it violated UK-defined guidelines. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, is to make the pledge in a speech in London on Wednesday morning, signalling her intent to make the environment, along with Brexit, a key priority for the party’s pitch to voters in a general election. “The Liberal Democrats want to see businesses take greater responsibility for the impact they have on the environment. That is why we want a general duty of care for the environment, to ensure that companies are avoiding behaviour in their operation and supply chains that is damaging to the environment,” she told the Guardian. “[We] have ambitious plans to tackle the climate emergency so that we can look after the planet we have because there is no planet B.” Under the proposed legislation, companies would be required to exercise due diligence with regard to certain commodities – for instance, products such as palm oil, crops or timber that could come from deforested areas – and to certain behaviours, such as modern slavery or child labour. The list of criteria would be set out separately, and could be expanded over time. These rules would be valid even if the companies were acting according to the law in the country where deforestation was occurring. If deforestation were set out in the secondary legislation as being something on which there was a requirement to report, then companies would have to report on it regardless of the legality in the country they were doing it. The proposed legislation would also encourage companies to exercise due diligence with regard to environmental, social and human rights issues in general and would require them to publish reports on the steps they have taken to exercise that due diligence. Swinson will also attack the government’s record on environmental issues, pointing to a lack of clear policy on how to achieve the net zero target that was enshrined in law under Theresa May, and what she said were failings in climate policy, such as support for fracking and airport expansion, scaling back support for renewables such as solar panels, and the privatisation of the Green Investment Bank. “The Conservatives’ record on the climate crisis is appalling. They have declared an emergency but have done nothing about it. That is like setting off the fire alarm and then standing by as you watch the house burn down,” she said. Other political parties are also considering rules to prevent goods being sold in the UK whose production contributes to deforestation, as environmental and trade issues have taken on greater prominence in the light of Brexit and a potential general election. Earlier this month, the Guardian revealed the extent to which products such as soy from deforested areas of the Amazon were found in British supermarkets. Molly Scott Cato, MEP for the Green party, told the Guardian: “Primary forests play a vital role as carbon sinks and in preserving biodiversity, so we need mechanisms in place to ensure firm action can be taken against countries that either encourage deforestation to push exports or fail to make efforts to protect their forests. We must take a lead by adopting legislation on mandatory due diligence, as the EU has done already with conflict minerals.” She gave Brazil as an example of where the principles should be applied, in the case of imports. “It is evident that [President] Bolsonaro has given the green light to land clearance for the production of beef and soy exports and has weakened forest protection. Brazil is therefore undermining its Paris Agreement commitments and firm action should follow. The EU and UK must refuse to sign up to trade deals with Brazil until it ends its ecological vandalism and work to regulate specific global supply chains based on the requirements of the Paris Agreement and the [UN’s] sustainable development goals.” Barry Gardiner MP, Labour’s shadow secretary of state for international trade and shadow minister for international climate change, told the Guardian his party would also move to tackle the problem. “We need a global consensus on measures to deal with trade arising from deforested areas.” he said. Gardiner added: “It is outrageous that the government is cosying up to Brazil’s rightwing government, which is actively supporting the widespread destruction of the Amazon through deliberate forest fires. Labour’s trade policy will be used to elevate environmental protections rather than opening up opportunities for big business to profit from significant environmental damage. the next Labour government will pursue trade agreements that meet our global climate obligations.” The government said it was “committed to working with our world-leading businesses to reduce the UK’s impact on deforestation overseas.”",Liberal Democrats; Politics; Environment; Deforestation; UK news; Trees and forests,Politics
2019-10-12T13:17:11Z,The IMF thinks carbon taxes will stop the climate crisis. That's a terrible idea | Kate Aronoff,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/12/carbon-tax-imf-inequality-climate-change,"A well-circulated statistic this week, from a new book by the University of California, Berkeley, economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, shows that the richest 400 families in the United States now pay a lower tax rate than the bottom 50% of families. Those 400 families – the 0.01% – own more wealth than 60% of households in the US. The top 0.1% own more than 80%. Rates for the top 0.01% and the bottom 50% have been creeping closer since 1960. Also this week, the Guardian’s polluters series found that just 20 private and state-owned fossil fuel producers are responsible for 35% of manmade carbon dioxide and methane emissions over a similar period. On Thursday, the IMF suggested a $75-per-ton global carbon tax is the most efficient way to fight greenhouse gas emissions and keep warming below 2C. The tax is, if anything, far too low. Mind, actual carbon prices worldwide average about $8 per ton, according to the OECD. And proposals for far lower carbon taxes in the US have been reliably shot down, albeit in no small part thanks to significant industry lobbying. Even this modest amount would raise energy prices in the US by 53%, since fossil fuel companies will pass the cost of the tax directly through to consumers. While it does consider the possibility of the tax funding clean energy investments or the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, the IMF – perhaps most famous for enforcing brutal austerity on to small debtor nations – also proposes using revenue generated by the tax in wealthy G20 nations to lower income taxes, “reduce fiscal deficits, or pay an equal dividend to the whole population”, so members of the top 0.01% are cut the same check as those in the bottom 50%. If the IMF thinks that’s going to make a $75-per-ton carbon tax politically feasible in the US, I have a yellow vest to sell them. In the context of gaping inequality, any climate policy that doesn’t look to make the economy more equal overall will be dead on arrival. The reason people have taken to the streets against fuel price hikes from France to Ecuador is pretty straightforward: the rich can afford to adjust, and the poor can’t. Barring huge state investments that allow the majority of people to lead lower-carbon lives – through public transit, energy-efficient housing and much more – even a tax with dividends paid back to the public is going to be met with protests, and rightfully so. Amid 30 years of wage stagnation in the US and decades of disinvestment from our public sphere, people using inefficient cars to drive to work or school isn’t a matter of making a greener choice. It’s a necessity, and a flat annual or monthly check, or even a few token investment projects, won’t change that. It’s not that we need the top 0.1%’s money, though. As the United States’ expansive military budget and fossil fuel subsidies should show, there is more than enough money lying around in the public purse to fully fund a rapid and equitable decarbonization tomorrow; we shouldn’t hold the fate of human civilization hostage to the Jeff Bezoses of the world. The reason to make tax rates fairer is simple: to eliminate billionaires. And let’s ban their carbon-spewing yachts and private jets while we’re at it. Among the ultra-wealthy, there’s also a special place in hell reserved for the executives of those 20 top-polluting companies, who have arguably done more to fuel the climate crisis than anyone else on Earth, misleading the public about its existence in the name of hoarding more and more wealth. Any climate policy worth its salt needs to directly confront the business model of the fossil fuel industry – to dig up and burn as much carbon dioxide as possible – and get rid of the generous subsidies and tax breaks they and their executives enjoy. Tax policy, after all, is social policy, and it reflects what a society values. As of now, the United States’ tax structure primarily values a small layer of elites who wreck the planet and extract wealth from the workers who actually run their companies – elites who then throw that wealth into hot real estate markets and the unregulated casino known as speculative finance so that their money can go on making more money. Still, the IMF report does represent a departure from its previous thinking, and shows just how far climate strikers and calls for a Green New Deal have shifted the political landscape on climate. As the report’s authors correctly note, “the economic costs of mitigating climate change through less-than-optimal tools would still be lower than the devastating effects of global warming”. But the most optimal tools aren’t going to cut it. We need more equitable ones.",Climate crisis; Environment; US news; World news; International Monetary Fund (IMF); Business; US taxation; Tax and spending,Opinion
2019-09-29T15:16:19Z,Nigeria warned it risks humanitarian disaster by expelling charities,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/29/nigeria-warned-it-risks-humanitarian-disaster-by-expelling-charities,"Nigeria has been warned it risks a humanitarian disaster if the government goes ahead with its threat to throw aid agencies out of the north-east of the country, claiming they are in league with extremist Islamic groups. A spate of aid offices have been forcibly shut after unproven claims they have been acting as conduits for cash that has ended up with Boko Haram, or Islamic State West Africa Province (Iswap). The Nigerian army is stepping up its 10-year effort to drive out extremists and claims that despite several warnings, agencies continue to provide aid to terrorist groups. Two aid agencies have had offices closed in the past few days, and there are fears in the charity sector that Nigeria is targeting as many as 10 independent humanitarian organisations. Talks are under way to try to defuse the breakdown in relations, and the charities say they often avoid transporting cash by road to avoid the risk of seizure. The reprisals came at the same time as the execution of a kidnapped Nigerian aid worker last Wednesday by extremists. The charity worker was among six aid workers employed by the Paris-based charity Action Against Hunger captured in July by Boko Haram during an ambush on a convoy close to the border with Niger. Action Against Hunger is the biggest NGO involved the international humanitarian response in the region. On 18 September, its office in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, was forcibly shut by the Nigerian army without warning or notice. The army claimed it had credible intelligence the charity was one of a number involved in subversive activities and was aiding and abetting terrorists, including by supplying drugs and food to extremist groups. In an angry rebuttal, Action Against Hunger said it strongly rejected the accusation. “Action Against Hunger delivers neutral, impartial and independent humanitarian aid to millions of people in Borno and Yobe states by providing basic services to the most vulnerable people, especially women and children,” the charity said. Action Against Hunger said it was ready “to support any investigation, and will work tirelessly with the Nigerian authorities to allay any concerns they may have about our operations in the region”. Another international aid agency, Mercy Corps, also said it had suspended operations in the north-eastern Borno and Yobe states, two of the worst affected by the violence. The Nigerian army had closed five of its offices, initially not providing any official explanation. Boko Haram effectively runs four of the 10 zones inside Borno, near Lake Chad, but the army and the government are reluctant to admit the counter-insurgency is failing. Mercy Corps’ head of media and communications, Amy Fairbairn, confirmed the organisation was seeking to work with the Nigerian army to resolve the position. In December 2018, the army also suspended Unicef from operating in the north-east over claims it was training “spies” who supported Boko Haram – only to lift the ban later the same day after a meeting with the aid agency. Iswap is a splinter faction of Boko Haram that swore allegiance in 2016 to the Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. It has repeatedly attacked military bases and targeted aid workers in north-east Nigeria. The UN humanitarian coordinator in Nigeria, Edward Kallon, said he was appalled by the killing of the aid workers and “extremely concerned by the increasingly dangerous and restrictive operating environment for humanitarian assistance”. In remarks aimed at the Nigerian army, he insisted the humanitarian community was working in line with the agreement reached between the government and aid workers, in place until 2021, to provide assistance to 6.2 million of the most vulnerable people. The army has announced a fresh nationwide crackdown, starting on 7 October, designed to find and arrest criminals and terrorists. Jeremy Hunt, the then foreign secretary, visited the area earlier this year, where he was briefed by a small British military team helping to advise the Nigerian army, but the degree of the UK military’s day-to-day influence over the Nigerian army’s strategy can be exaggerated. One worker from an aid agency based in Nigeria that could not be named for fear of reprisals said: “If humanitarian agencies are kicked out of north-east Nigeria then thousands of Nigerian civilians will needlessly die, including many children – it will be a humanitarian disaster. “Someone needs to ask the Nigerians and the UN some serious questions about how the government of Nigeria is getting away with this while it sits on stage in New York, presiding over the UN general assembly and preaching about ending conflict and fighting poverty in the drive to reach the sustainable development goals.” The war with Boko Haram has devastated the population in rural north-east Nigeria, one of the poorest regions on earth. More than 2 million people have fled their homes, tens of thousands have been killed, and many more injured, abducted and conscripted to join the fight. Last month, the International Committee of the Red Cross said about 22,000 Nigerians had been reported missing during the decade-long crisis, nearly half of them minors.",Nigeria; Boko Haram; Islamic State; Aid; Global development; Africa; World news,World news
2019-09-12T04:00:39Z,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation under fire over award for Narendra Modi,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/12/bill-and-melinda-gates-foundation-under-fire-over-award-for-narendra-modi,"The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is facing a barrage of criticism from prominent lawyers, human rights activists and philanthropists after it announced that it would honour India’s controversial Hindu nationalist prime minister with an award later this month. The Global Goalkeeper award recognises Narendra Modi’s flagship Clean India programme, through which the government has built millions of toilets and publicised the benefits of sanitation and hygiene. The award comes amid growing criticism of the disenfranchisement, detention and deportation of Muslims in Assam and Kashmir. Alleged human rights violations in the two states under the governing Bharatiya Janata party have made front pages around the world. The award will be the latest addition to Modi’s growing haul of prestigious international prizes. On Tuesday, a group of south Asian Americans working in philanthropy wrote an open letter to the Gates Foundation alleging that Modi had effectively confined millions to their communities, and urging the organisation to rescind the award. “For over a month now, PM Modi has placed 8 million people in Jammu and Kashmir under house arrest, blocked communications and media coverage to the outside world, detained thousands of people including children, and denied basic benefits. Reports of torture, including beatings and the murder of a young child by Indian security officers, are emerging as well,” said the letter. “The award will signal the international community’s willingness to overlook, and remain silent, in the face of the Indian government’s brazen violations of human rights principles.” Suchitra Vijayan, a lawyer and co-founder of the research and journalism portal Polis Project, said philanthropic organisations had played a crucial role in “whitewashing and normalising” Modi’s violations of human rights and democracy. Until his election to India’s highest office in 2014, Modi had been unable to enter the US because of his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots, in which thousands of Muslims were slaughtered during his tenure as chief minister. “The narrative is India being the world’s largest democracy, India being a great place to invest, India shining,” Vijayan said. “All that only counts if the international community recognises these narratives.” Since Modi came to power, he has received accolades from governments and organisations around the world. The Philip Kotler presidential award honoured Modi for “giving new life to democracy and economic growth”, while the Seoul peace prize credited him for reducing the social and economic disparity between the rich and the poor. The latter award was made despite worldwide criticism of Modi’s economic policies, including demonetisation, by economic experts. Last year, the UN gave Modi the Champions of the Earth award, in spite of objections that his government has not only green lit projects that threaten to cause huge deforestation, but also allowed India’s capital, New Delhi, to become one of the most polluted cities on Earth. The Swachh Bharat programme, for which Modi is receiving his latest award, has come under huge scrutiny in India. Modi’s government has said that the scheme has provided 90% of Indians with access to clean toilets. However, press reports and a book called Where India Goes, which closely studied the programme, suggest that many of the newly-built toilets remain unused because of poor access to water and caste rules that restrict many people from cleaning them. India’s government has employed controversial tactics to encourage use of the toilets, including “good morning squads” that involve government officials publicly humiliating those defecating openly. One news channel ran a national “name and shame” campaign urging citizens to “blow the whistle” on those defecating openly. The Gates Foundation said in a statement that Modi was being recognised for “the progress India is making in improving sanitation, as part of its drive toward achievement of the UN sustainable development goals”. “Globally, sanitation-related diseases kill nearly 500,000 children under the age of five every year,” said the statement. “Yet despite its importance, sanitation has not received significant attention. A lot of governments are not willing to talk about it, in part because there are not easy solutions. “Before the Swachh Bharat mission, over 500 million people in India did not have access to safe sanitation, and now, the majority do. There is still a long way to go, but the impacts of access to sanitation in India are already being realised. The Swachh Bharat mission can serve as a model for other countries around the world that urgently need to improve access to sanitation for the world’s poorest.”",India; South and central Asia; World news,World news
2019-07-09T13:43:47Z,World leaders have 'a lot to answer for' over damning figures on education,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jul/09/world-leaders-damning-figures-education-helen-clark,"World leaders have “a lot to answer for” as new figures reveal that governments are failing to give all children an education, and that by 2030 one in six children won’t be in school. The former prime minister of New Zealand and advocate for education Helen Clark said the figures showed “worrisome complacency on the part of countries which, just a few years ago, were so keen to hammer out an ambitious global agenda and make it a success”. “Education is slipping down the aid agenda when it should be rising up,” Clark said. As part of the sustainable development goals, UN members states promised that all children would complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education. But Unesco predicts that by the 2030 deadline, one in six children aged six to 17 still won’t be in education, including one in 11 primary school-aged children. Taking stock of progress a third of the way towards the deadline for a high-level political forum on sustainable development in New York this week, Unesco analysed responses by 72 governments and key city or municipal authorities, concluding that without a significant acceleration, the world will miss its education commitments. Researchers found that as well as children continuing to miss out on the chance to go to school, many who do start education are still dropping out. By 2030, they predict that 40% of young people will still not complete secondary education. “Considering that ‘a good quality education’ was voted young people’s most important priority in 2015 when the SDGs were being decided, leaders today have a lot to answer for. Countries must commit to investing more in education now so that we do not break the global promise made to today’s children and youth,” said Clark, who is chair of the Global Education Monitoring Report advisory board. “Today’s warning [on the education goal] has worrying implications for the whole 2030 agenda on sustainable development. It’s never too late to act to correct course, but doing so is now urgent if the global agenda is to be achieved.” Gordon Brown, former prime minister and the UN’s special envoy on global education, said: “Once again new projections by Unesco show that we are failing our youth by not guaranteeing access to quality education … We need to do more to support and encourage countries to commit to education, which is key to healthy societies.” In 2018 Brown launched the $10bn (£8bn) International Finance Facility for Education, backed by the UN and the World Bank. He emphasised the need to continue to develop new streams of financing “to provide the means to invest and reform education systems. There is no time to waste.” Unesco’s snapshot of the global state of education also highlights ongoing inequalities. While literacy rates are improving globally, within low-income countries, projections show that about 20% of young people and 30% of adults will still not be able to read by 2030. An estimated 750 million adults cannot currently read. In low-income countries, only 4% of the poorest finish upper secondary school and only 2% among the poorest girls, compared with 36% of the richest. Many governments are adopting policies to try to meet their commitments, including in early and life-long learning, but funding remains an issue. A report on the second sustainable development goal, Zero Hunger, will be launched on 15 July, and the forum concludes with ministerial meetings from 16-18 July.",Global education; Global development; Education; Sustainable development goals; Environmental sustainability; Sustainable development; Environment; Society,Global development
2019-09-11T05:00:14Z,Leak suggests UN agency self-censors on climate crisis after US pressure,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/sep/11/leak-suggests-un-agency-self-censors-on-climate-crisis-after-us-pressure,"Leaked communications suggest that the UN’s migration agency is censoring itself on the climate crisis and the global compact on migration, following pressure from the US government. An email sent by a US-based official of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) on 28 August to colleagues around the world relayed that the US state department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM) told the agency documents related to programme activities it funds “must not be in conflict with current [US government] political sensitivities”. Sensitivities include the climate crisis, sustainable development goals, the global compact for migration and “anything that seems at odds with the administration’s take on US domestic/foreign issues”, the official wrote in the email. “Documents related to programme activities, especially those that will be published online, may require prior review and approval by the donor,” they went on, requesting that colleagues use “discretion” and share relevant documents “in enough time to make any necessary adjustments in coordination with PRM”. The email’s author noted that “PRM is very willing to cut funding in areas that it deems are not in line with US foreign policy objectives”, and asked that the substance of the email be conveyed by regional coordinators “to all country focal points”. The Guardian understands from IOM sources and further communications it has seen that the agency is avoiding direct references to climate change in documents for projects funded by other US government entities such as USAid. IOM receives about a quarter of its total budget of $2bn (£1.6bn) from the US, $18m of which is provided by PRM. There is no indication that messaging on projects funded by other donors will be censored, or that there will be any operational impact on existing programmes. However, a source in the humanitarian community in the US who had recently left IOM, told the Guardian he was “very concerned … that IOM is acquiescing to this kind of pressure”. “I’ve seen a response [to the email] from at least one regional official who explicitly asked staff not to directly refer to climate change or the global compact on migration in a range of reports or proposals that would be sent to the US government,” he said. “While I understand that IOM are simply doing what they think is strategically necessary to protect funding for important projects, senior officials should be mindful of the fact that there’s a slippery slope here,” he continued. Jeff Crisp, a research associate at Oxford University’s Refugee Studies Centre who previously held a senior position in the UN’s refugee agency UNHCR, said the leaked message “raises some serious questions about the autonomy of IOM, its sensitivity to positions adopted by the US administration, and its ability to function as a member of the UN system”. Akshaya Kumar, director of crisis advocacy at Human Rights Watch, said: “Confronting climate change may very well be the issue that defines our time. Agencies in the UN family shouldn’t be towing the Trump party line.” Tensions between the US and IOM have simmered over the past year, when Ken Isaacs, the proposed US candidate to head the agency, became the first American since the 1960s to be rejected as its top official, prompting concerns that funding from the state department could be cut. Press reports at the time revealed that Isaacs had made comments online expressing doubts over the evidence for climate change, suggesting it was a “hoax”. President Trump himself has expressed doubts about the effects and causes of climate change, while the US objected to the global compact on migration, describing it as a “pro-migration” agreement and an “effort by the United Nations to advance global governance at the expense of the sovereign right of states”. Leonard Doyle, IOM’s head of communications, said: “IOM recognises and respects the priorities and limitations of its donors, including the US. We seek to ensure that staff are aware of such sensitivities when drafting funding proposals for activities which are a response to migration trends and which follow best practice.” A US state department spokesperson said: “IOM is an important partner for the United States around the globe. The US government supports organisations such as IOM, to conduct programmes and activities that are consistent with our foreign policy goals and objectives.” • This article was amended on 11 September 2019.

2019-09-08T09:09:50Z,'It’ll be a little apocalyptic': Spanish theatre troupe to take to high seas,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/08/spanish-theatre-troupe-la-fura-dels-baus-naumon,"Five hundred years after Ferdinand Magellan and his pan-European crew sailed, starved and mutinied their way around the world, a Spanish theatre company best known for its innovative and often provocative performances is paying homage to the long-dead explorers with a voyage of its own. The Barcelona-based collective La Fura dels Baus made headlines in 2003 when its honestly named XXX show opened in London after being cleared by the Metropolitan police’s vice squad. Their latest undertaking, however, is considerably more hardcore. In spring next year, the company’s trusty ship, the Naumon (Worldship), will begin a tour of Spanish ports to commemorate the first circumnavigation of the world and to warn of the need for action on the climate emergency. Aided by a rigid but foldable high-tech sail, it will then crisscross the world, spreading its message from sea to sea and port to port. Carlus Padrissa, one of the founders of La Fura dels Baus – “and also slightly the captain of this project” – sees the 1519-22 circumnavigation as one of the greatest achievements of European, and indeed human, history. “For me, it’s on a par with reaching the moon or going to Mars,” he says. “Of the 270 who set out, only 18 made it back. This was the time when man came out of the darkness of the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance. “This is when people all over the world began to interact. The idea is to put on a show to say to people: ‘Look, we’re all on the same planet – we’re all in the same boat – so why don’t we try rowing in the same direction?’” The Naumon, which has been bobbing on the freshwaters of the Rhine for the past decade, is being fixed up in a Santander shipyard. Once the eight metre by 20 metre sail, designed by Bound4Blue , has been fitted, sea tests will begin and the team hopes the ship will make its first call in Seville early next year. Members of the theatre company will be joined by scientists from Spain’s National Research Council, who will monitor the sail’s performance and conduct experiments. “In September, we’ll head for Hamburg,” says Padrissa. “After that, we’ll go wherever they call us.” Padrissa points out that the Naumon, which was built in Norway in 1964, is one of countless polluting vessels in need of a cleaner means of propulsion. “We have to put a new sail on. The idea is to recycle and to show that our generation of baby boomers can be a bit of a problem for the planet.” He also notes that the Naumon was originally an ice-breaker: “So it’s a perfect concept for smashing cultural ice.” In each port, the company will stage Sfera Mundi, a big show that follows on from the spectacle La Fura dels Baus created for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. Key themes will include poverty, illness and pollution. The Naumon itself will also play host to an immersive exhibition. “It will be about the possibility of a third world war and what will happen if the world falls apart because of climate change,” says Padrissa. “It’ll be a little apocalyptic, a little bit like Picasso’s Guernica. We want people to come out and say: ‘Shit! What do I have to do to stop things happening?’” With the Naumon undergoing its latest metamorphosis as the sail is attached and its hull painted in the colours of the UN sustainable development goals, Padrissa and other members of the collective find themselves suffering anxieties long shared by theatre companies and expedition planners. Fears of seasickness and scurvy, of mutiny or of being reduced to eating leather are overshadowed by thoughts of empty coffers. “We’re a bit worried about money – we don’t know exactly how much things will cost because we don’t really know where we’ll be going,” says Padrissa. “We’ve spent money bringing the Naumon back; we’ve spent money fixing it up. We don’t have any more money. We’ve got some deals lined up but we’re worried about being able to pull it off properly. We don’t have the dosh to get all the way around the world.” But then again, he adds, the whole enterprise is a bit on the hoof, or keel. And that is rather the point. “There’s no plan,” says Padrissa. “It’s a bit like Magellan: they set off but they weren’t really sure where they were going or what they’d find. It’s all an adventure. Will we do it? Won’t we? Will we ruin ourselves? We don’t know. It’s about risk and adventure.”",Spain; Climate crisis; Theatre; Europe; Barcelona; World news; Environment; Stage,World news
2019-11-17T08:00:00Z,How could it be that the Tories have turned their back on the best of British industry? | Will Hutton,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/17/how-could-it-be-that-the-tories-have-turned-their-back-on-the-best-of-british-industry,"For the past 40 years, the Conservative party has always championed an economic theory. Whether 1980s monetarism or 2010s austerity economics, I thought them bunk. But while Nigel Lawson or George Osborne were clearly wrong, at least there was an intellectual underpinning for their actions, an underpinning you could shoot at. You also knew that, one way or another, Tory policy was aiming to serve the mainstream business interest. British business represented by the CBI or the various trade association lobbies, notably the Corporation of the City of London, had privileged access and policy reflected their preoccupations. Business might sometimes complain, but in the round it knew it was heard. No more. The conversion of the Tory party into the Brexit party has robbed it of both an intellectual structure and its reliable association with the business mainstream. Brexit has stripped the party of its brain and left it with just a frame of mind – Europhobia. So when Carolyn Fairbairn, the director-general of the CBI, complains, as she did last week, that both parties now ignore business, it’s a statement of a new political economy. The CBI may represent British-based and British-owned capitalism, but it is judged no longer significant enough for the Tories to heed. Our capitalism has fractured. A new world of very private, transnational finance capital has emerged – hedge funds, private equity, billionaires of whatever nationality. It is they who now largely fund the Tory party and for whom Europhobia translates into a fabulous short-term profitable opportunity. Brexit Britain will be a regulation-light land fit for hedge fund and private equity capitalism. In this world, Fairbairn is not a player. She may represent publicly quoted companies that collectively employ millions, but for a Europhobe such as the business secretary, Andrea Leadsom – and our “fuck business” prime minister – they are part of the Tories’ Remain problem. They dare to see merit in the EU’s single market and customs union. They warn that rupturing complex Europe-wide supply chains threatens hundreds of thousands of jobs and exporting into the EU will be further damaged by the imposition of EU tariffs. They are concerned that the British capacity to shape EU regulations that has so helped companies such as Vodafone reach global dominance is being shredded. Worse, a growing number of these companies buy into the notion that their employees are members and colleagues rather than disposable workers, and, on top, worry that they need to trade sustainably. They put workers on their boards – Capita – treat them properly – Unipart and Kingfisher – or do more than pay PR lip service to the UN’s sustainable development goals – Unilever. A real capitalist in today’s Tory eyes is a super-rich Europhobe out to make fast money who doesn’t buy into those politically correct nostrums, such as Jim Ratcliffe, billionaire owner of the chemicals company Ineos, Christopher Miller, co-founder of the asset stripper Melrose, or Crispin Odey of the hedge fund Odey Asset Management. They speak up for Brexit and will payroll the cause – more ideologically sympathetic capitalists than the liberal, decent, fair-minded Ms Fairbairn. But the party cannot openly acknowledge its new loyalties and aims – it is aware that British society is badly wounded. It has to have something persuasive to say to the electorate, hence the riffs about the NHS, police officers and schools. Inherited fiscal rules from the ancien regime of May and Hammond can be torched. New rules, allowing much more freedom, are cynically adopted, not because today’s Tory party is intellectually convinced about the need for the state to create more and better public goods but because the new rules create the necessary headroom to spend the money to buy votes. They could be freely changed again as politics dictates. It is degenerate economics to build a land fit for Messrs Radcliffe, Miller, Odey and sundry Russian billionaires. This could and should be a golden opportunity for the non-Conservative, pro-EU opposition. Labour does believe that the state should provide more and better public goods, ranging from a better environment via the Green New Deal to free broadband delivered by its proposed British Broadband Corporation, and there is a substantive body of intellectual argument to support its position. Of necessity, that means more public spending and borrowing and the rules Labour proposes serve that goal. The framework – a cap on public debt interest of 10% of tax receipts, balancing current public spending and current revenues over the economic cycle, and proposing a target for increasing the public sector’s net worth rather than the stock of public debt alone – makes sense. It is a welcome break from the past 40 years. That is not its weakness. But it should worry Labour that Fairbairn’s remarks are aimed at it as well. Its leadership is too indiscriminately critical of all business and wedded to the socialist transformation of capitalism. Not even the Chinese and Cuban Communist parties believe that. Given that capitalism’s universal supremacy is justified because it works, how can it be shaped better to deliver the common good? Part of the answer lies in better and more public goods, tougher progressive taxation to address inequality and stronger social provision, all of which Labour is committed to. But another answer is scaling up what the better publicly quoted companies are trying to do in opposition to hedge fund capitalism. Here Labour is silent, worse, creating enemies who could be allies. Mainstream British business, trying to do the right thing, should be part of a broad-based Labour coalition that wants, if a second referendum is ever achieved, to stay in the European Union and build a capitalism that serves the common good. The Tories have abandoned the ground. It is there for Labour – or the Lib Dems if they have the bravery and chutzpah – to occupy. My fear is that only another drubbing will convince Labour to be more discerning about capitalism – who its enemies are and who are its potential allies. • Will Hutton is an Observer columnist",Conservatives; Confederation of British Industry (CBI); Labour; Politics; Business; UK news,Opinion
2019-11-11T15:49:55Z,Richard Stanley obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/11/richard-stanley-obituary,"The independent film producer Richard Stanley, who has died aged 71, was a master storyteller and the creative force behind a campaign that has put road safety in the developing world on the international agenda. Fifteen years ago road safety in the world’s poorest countries was a cause without champions. While other health epidemics prompted global summits, road traffic injury – the leading global killer of young people aged between five and 29 – was consigned to peripheral meetings of technical experts. To Richard, this was indefensible. Working with the FIA Foundation from 2004, Richard framed a new campaigning narrative. His weapon of choice was the documentary and short-form video. Stunning cinematography provided the backdrop to a gritty reportage. Richard cajoled successive UN secretary generals, prime ministers, presidents and heads of development agencies to go on the record about road traffic injury. But his lead characters were always the forgotten victims and ordinary people: bereaved mothers, injured children, and people left with shattered limbs. Richard’s 2009 documentary Dying to Go to School set a standard. Presented by the actor Michelle Yeoh, and focusing on the quarter-of-a-million children killed on roads in developing countries each year, it was aired worldwide on the BBC in advance of the first ever ministerial conference on global road safety. Like many of Richard’s friends, I was enrolled into the cause by his infectious commitment. One moment I was being reminded that, like so many other UN officials, I was neglecting a major cause of human suffering. The next I was in Kenya participating in one of Richard’s documentaries. One shot involved crossing the eight-lane Nairobi-Mombasa highway with children from the sprawling slum of Kibera, some as young as 12, making their way to school. For point of reference, try imagining your child crossing the M1, without the aid of traffic lights or bridges. The breakthrough came in 2015 when, remarkably, halving deaths from road traffic injury was adopted by 193 governments as one of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) – a set of targets intended to steer international priorities to 2030. This was a triumph of effective advocacy backed by brilliant campaigning through film. But it was also a product of new partnerships and coalitions working together to build transport systems fit for people. One of Richard’s gifts was his ability to work collaboratively, bringing people together and working as part of a campaigning community. Richard’s work on global road safety was the culmination of an extraordinary career. He was born in Cambridge, the younger son of Kate (nee Furness) and Louis Stanley, a journalist who later became head of the British Racing Motors Formula 1 team and a pioneer in improving racetrack safety. His parents divorced when he was a few months old, and Richard was raised by his mother, whom he adored, and from whom he inherited a love of poetry and literature. Richard did not thrive at school – Frensham Heights in Surrey – but he always loved writing and had an early interest in photography: he and his brother, John, transformed the family bathroom into a darkroom. Having married Sandra Rose in 1965, with whom he had two sons, Giles and Matt, Richard entered the world of journalism. Graduating from local newspapers in Oxford, where he developed the tools of the trade, Richard was thrilled to get a job in the newly established Radio Oxford in the early 1970s, working in news and on his own music show, Full Circle. It was during this period that the campaigner in Richard began to emerge. Influenced by a John Pilger documentary, he became increasingly interested in international development. Making a short trip across the road from Radio Oxford, he joined Oxfam as communications director, leading a series of campaigns and fundraising appeals. Convinced that film could reach new audiences and drive social purpose campaigning, Richard created his own independent company with his second wife, Chrissie Jakeman, in 1983 (his first marriage having ended in divorce). With Oxfam as his first client, Richard made one of the first campaigning films on fair trade, training his lens on the poverty of cocoa growers and the vast profits of the chocolate industry. Hungry for Change (1985), another campaigning film, was years ahead of its time, prefacing Oxfam’s later work on African debt and unfair trade. Much to the displeasure of the Foreign Office, in 1987 Richard persuaded Julie Christie to make a film in Cambodia highlighting the UK’s continued acceptance of Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge regime as Cambodia’s representatives at the United Nations. The policy was quietly changed a few months later. Today, we would describe Richard’s career as a portfolio enterprise. He thought of it as doing what he loved. Mixing BBC and freelance journalism with activism during the 1980s, he interviewed Henry Miller, Joni Mitchell, Roald Dahl and Gore Vidal, among many others. It was during this period that Richard met and married Chrissie, with whom he had two children, Jess and Kate. While road safety campaigning dominated the last 15 years of his life, Richard also worked with the former US president Jimmy Carter and the Task Force for Global Health to produce a series of films on neglected tropical diseases including trachoma. He produced a powerful video documentary for the World Health Organisation on adolescent suicide. Richard was a perfectionist and a consummate professional. He dedicated his art to causes he believed in – and to people bearing the brunt of injustice. Behind the warm smile was a steely drive to make a difference, and he did. In his personal life Richard was kind beyond measure. His friends loved him for his warmth, compassion, and endlessly interesting reflections on life and literature. For Richard family was everything. He was devoted to Chrissie and his children, one of whom, Matt, worked with him as an editor from the early 1990s. At the mention of his six grandchildren his eyes would light up, a beaming smile cross his face, and a gallery of photos would appear on his iPad. He is survived by Chrissie, his children, and grandchildren, Milo, Tilly, Emmett, Alice, Rafe and Laurie, and his brother, John. • Richard Mark Stanley, film-maker and road safety campaigner, born 27 April 1948; died 25 October 2019",Road safety; Film; United Nations,World news
2019-09-25T06:54:48Z,Turning the tables: global poverty conference to be held in a slum,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/sep/25/global-poverty-conference-to-be-held-in-slum,"A global conference on poverty is to take place in Africa’s largest slum in an effort to make sure the poorest get a voice. The inaugural World Poverty Forum will be announced on Wednesday in New York at the Decade of Action event taking place during UN general assembly week. It is already being dubbed as “Davos with the poor”. Social entrepreneur Kennedy Odede, who was raised in the slum of Kibera, in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, has founded the event to bring world leaders and policymakers together to “change the dynamic” of the way the big global issues are discussed. He said it was about making “worlds collide”. “It is high time that the policymakers come to us, the people and the communities who are doing great work on the ground,” he told the Guardian. “Meetings like Davos are all very well, to bring together world leaders, but there is no space for them to interact with the poor and with people doing the work in the communities. So this forum will fill this gap.” The forum is designed to tackle world poverty by reversing the often unequal power dynamics of development conferences, and will take place in January. It will be that rare example, said Odede, of a conference choosing its location to give a real voice to the poorest in finding solutions to their own problems. “We will have a 50/50 split of influential leaders and of community leaders from Kibera, from Africa, from India, from Brazil, who have been left out of the conversations for too long. “This is not about people helicoptering in. They will come with humility, they will come in as our guest and we will showcase all the things people in Kibera can teach the world,” he said. “It is meant to be a learning journey – what is working, what is not working. We can learn from each other when the community get a voice. “People on the frontline must be included. They have to have a place at the table. “They have been left out of the decisions made about them. Why? Because it’s all been about top to bottom. Now it has to be about bottom to top, because inequality is growing too much. We need to fight this. “I’m so excited. This is for me a big step. We will be a bridge between real people and policymakers.” WPF will be one of the first events in next year’s plans to accelerate progress towards meeting the sustainable development goals, which are being widely criticised at the UNGA this week as being off course and unlikely to be met by the 2030 target. Odede, who is also the co-founder of Shofco, an organisation working in urban slums, said: “It is sometimes forgotten that any programme to improve lives can only be successful it if works with the grain of individuals – and the bundles of talent, hope and fear that make up their unique experiences. We will bring leaders to a place where they can feel both the unforgiving reality of poverty alongside the hope that an institution like Shofco can create. “The World Poverty Forum will spark new ideas through worlds colliding, bringing together leading politicians, CEOs, NGOs, entrepreneurs and thinkers, with those who are making things happen on the frontline, in the thick of the community – rather than in a western five-star hotel. “We want to reverse the usual power dynamics of development conferences and release the energies that genuine collaboration can bring.” A two-day programme will focus on practical solutions to the issues of health, education, conflict and climate crisis that keep people entrenched in poverty. Delegates will visit projects in Kibera as well as attending “Hacking Poverty” seminars that look for simple solutions to everyday hardships. It will also celebrate pioneers in the global fight against poverty – from individuals and tech startups to NGOs and corporations – with the launch of the first Kibera Awards. The event will hire local photographers, video crews, caterers and musicians and hold the daytime events in the Shofco school inside Kibera. The contribution of local people’s talents is intended as a reminder to delegates that there are rich pools of skill, flair and inventiveness in the world’s poorest communities. More than 700 million people – 10% of the world’s population – live in extreme poverty – defined as earning less than $1.90 a day. While many regions are making good progress with poverty reduction, almost all of Africa, especially sub-Saharan Africa, is off-track for ending extreme poverty. It is predicted 13 African countries will see an increase in the absolute numbers of extreme poor between now and 2030. More than 1.3 billion people across the globe are described as “multidimensionally poor” – defined by ways in which people experience deprivation beyond their income, such as health, education and the standard of living. “There is an urgent need for a fresh approach to lifting up the world’s poorest as recent progress has been slow, patchy and unstable,” said Odede. 2020, he said, was “make or break year”.",Global development; Kenya; Africa; World news; Inequality and development,Global development
2019-09-19T06:00:23Z,Biodiversity touches every aspect of our lives – so why has its loss been ignored?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/19/biodiversity-touches-every-aspect-of-our-lives-so-why-has-its-loss-been-ignored,"The evidence is unequivocal: biodiversity, important in its own right and essential for current and future generations, is being destroyed by human activities at a rate unprecedented in human history. Governments around the world recognised this at the Earth summit in Brazil in 1992 and established the Convention on Biological Diversity to protect and conserve biodiversity. But the situation has become more and more dire. I have chaired or co-chaired three international assessments on the state of knowledge of biodiversity, and all have repeated the same message – we are destroying it at an alarming rate. Each time we have called for action, only to be largely ignored. The continued loss of biodiversity is not only an environmental issue. It risks undermining the achievement of most of the UN sustainable development goals. It is central to development, through food, water and energy security. It has significant economic value, which should be recognised in national accounting systems. It is a security issue in so far as loss of natural resources, especially in developing countries, can lead to conflict. It is an ethical issue because loss of biodiversity hurts the poorest people, further exacerbating an already inequitable world. And it is also a moral issue, because we should not destroy the living planet. In addition to playing a critical role in providing food, fibre, water, energy, medicines and other genetic materials, biodiversity is equally important in regulating climate, water quality, pollution, pollination, flooding and storm surges. It has vital social value, providing wellbeing when walking through forests or by rivers, or green spaces in cities. Since 1970, human activities have destroyed and degraded forests, grasslands, wetlands and other ecosystems and significantly altered 75% of the ice-free land surface. Most oceans are polluted with plastics, and over 85% of wetland area has been lost. This destruction of ecosystems has led to a million species (500,000 animals and plants and 500,000 insects) being threatened with extinction, although many are preventable if we improve our management of biodiversity. The largest driver of biodiversity loss on land in recent decades has been land use change, primarily the conversion of pristine native habitats into agricultural systems to feed the world, while oceans are over-fished . This has been driven in large part by a doubling of the world’s population, a fourfold increase in the global economy, and a tenfold increase in trade. The challenge is to transform our agricultural and fishing practices, many of which are unsustainable today, into ones that produce the food we need while conserving biodiversity. For agriculture, this means using sustainable agroecological practices; less chemicals, fertilisers and pesticides; and protecting soils and pollinators. The climate crisis and the loss of biodiversity are issues that affect each other. Global heating adversely affects genetic variability, species richness and ecosystems. Loss of biodiversity can adversely affect climate – deforestation increases the atmospheric abundance of carbon dioxide for example, a greenhouse gas. So it is essential that the issues of biodiversity loss and the climate crisis are addressed together. To date, climate crisis has received most of the attention. The limited attention on biodiversity tends to focus on saving large charismatic animals, rather than informing the public of the importance of biodiversity to human life. In 2010, governments around the world agreed to a set of 20 targets for 2020 to protect biodiversity – the Aichi targets. Unfortunately, most countries, including in Europe, will not achieve them. Governments will meet in Kunming, China, next year to establish a plan of action. It will be a critical milestone to see whether there is the political will to implement the transformative changes needed. The challenge is immense, but can be met if countries act individually and collectively. Business as usual and scenarios that focus on economic growth and regional competition will lead to continued loss of biodiversity. Sustainable consumption practices can slow, but not completely eliminate, future loss of biodiversity, in part because warming will continue in all scenarios. Incremental changes will not suffice. Concerted efforts are needed to address the causes of nature deterioration – poor governance, unsustainable economic systems, inequalities, lack of cross-sectoral planning and incentives, unsustainable social narratives and values. We need to steer away from the limiting paradigm of economic growth that prioritises GDPand recognise the social values of biodiversity and the social costs of environmental degredation. We also need to eliminate harmful agricultural, energy and transportation subsidies and incentivise sustainable production. Governments, the private sector and civil society must work together to address the human-induced climate crisis and biodiversity loss. Is there room for optimism? Yes. The youth of today are standing up and demanding action. School strikes and marches are sending a loud and clear message: “You are destroying our future, we demand action now”. Every one of us who lives in a democratic society must vote for politicians who care about these issues. • Robert Watson is the former chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services",Environment; Biodiversity; Wildlife; World news; Conservation,Environment
2019-01-23T12:39:33Z,Bono: western world turning its back on HIV fight,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jan/23/bono-davos-hiv-aids-aid-spending-global-health,"The world is at risk of losing the battle against HIV due to a backlash against aid triggered by a sense that western governments need to solve problems in their own countries, the musician and development campaigner Bono has said. Speaking on a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the U2 singer said populism in the rich north was the result of people being chewed up by capitalism. Bono said 7,000 women a week were being infected by HIV/Aids and called for fresh funding for global health initiatives. “We could lose this thing,” he said. “We were winning. We have been somewhat put on the back foot by the understandable concern in northern economies that we have problems in our own cities. If there are people on the streets in our own cities, why should we care about what’s going on over there? “The answer is that what is going on ‘over there’ affects us. If Africa loses, Europe can’t win. But we have got to get back into the conversation. We need a response to what is going on in our own cities.” Bono, who helped set up the campaign group One, said capitalism had lifted more people out of poverty than “any other ism”, but warned: “It is a wild beast. If it is not tamed it can chew up a lot of people along the way.” Populism was the result of people being chewed up, he added. Failure on the part of governments and businesses to invest in Africa would leave the way open for China to fill the void, Bono said. “China is the elephant in the room.” Young people were asking a question of business and political leaders: “Are you a firefighter or are you an arsonist?” Speaking at the same event, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said it was simply impossible for poor countries to mobilise enough resources domestically to meet basic development goals for sectors such as health, education, roads and water. To meet UN sustainable development goals by 2030 would mean investment worth an additional 15% of GDP for low income countries. Lagarde said: “That’s monumental. No way can that be done by domestic resource mobilisation. Business has to be part of it.” The IMF said that achieving the 2030 sustainable development goals (SDG) set by the UN would require strong partnerships between the public and the private sectors. Countries needed to take a lead by improving the running of their economies, boosting the capacity to collect taxes, making public spending more efficient and creating business-friendly environments. But hitting the SDG goals also required the support of the private sector, donors, philanthropists, and international financial institutions. Lagarde told developing country leaders that combatting corruption was vital to prevent international investors from being scared off. Bono added that he had once seen the IMF as a “great Satan”, due to its emphasis on structural reforms and bullying of junior economies. Now, though, he says the development community “really values” the tough-mindedness shown by Lagarde – but he’ll still be “on her case”.",Aid; Business; Global health; Aids and HIV; Bono; Health; Global development; World news; Davos 2019,Global development
2019-08-20T20:00:48Z,What's in our water? Report warns of growing 'invisible' crisis of pollution,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/aug/20/whats-in-our-water-report-warns-of-growing-invisible-crisis-of-pollution,"The planet is facing a mounting and “invisible” water pollution crisis, according to a hard-hitting World Bank report, which claims the issue is responsible for a one-third reduction in potential economic growth in the most heavily affected areas. The study, which assembled the world’s largest database of water pollution, assesses how a combination of bacteria, sewage, chemicals and plastics suck oxygen from water supplies and transform water into poison for people and ecosystems. While much international attention has been focused on the question of water quantity, not least as the planet warms, a secondary impact of the climate emergency has been its effect on water quality. Because of the huge number of different pollutants entering the environment, researchers focused on the key measures for water quality laid down in the UN’s sustainable development goals, in particular nutrient loads, salt balances, and the overall environmental health. The authors of the report employed a variety of technologies to study the problem, including satellite imaging of major algae blooms and artificial intelligence to assess the data they were collecting. In particular researchers looked at a key measure called biological oxygen demand (BOD) to assess how much organic pollution is in water, using it as an indicator of overall water quality. The researchers noted that when BOD crosses a certain threshold, GDP growth in areas affected by the problem drops by as much as a third because of the impact on health, agriculture and ecosystems. Although issues with water pollution affect both rich and poor countries, the researchers suggest that developing countries have the least resources to deal with the issue. A key contributor to poor water quality is nitrogen, which, applied as fertiliser in agriculture, eventually enters rivers, lakes and oceans where it transforms into nitrates. Early exposure of children to nitrates affects their growth and brain development, impacting their health and adult earning potential. The run-off and release into water from every additional kilogram of nitrogen fertiliser per hectare can increase the level of childhood stunting by as much as 19% percent and reduce future adult earnings by as much as 2%, compared with those who are not exposed. Researchers also looked at the growing issue of salinity – salt contamination – blamed on more intense droughts, storm surges and rising water extraction. They estimated that at current levels its impact on agriculture means that the food lost because of saline water across the world would feed 170 million people. The report notes that even wealthy countries still have serious issues with water pollution. “Even high-income economies with well-resourced institutions find themselves unable to cope with the challenges,” the authors report, citing the notorious contamination of the drinking water supply in Flint in the US. “Four decades after the passing of the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act, over 100,000 residents in Flint were exposed to lead in their drinking water. “It required a national movement and three years for water to return to acceptable safety levels, but not before potentially thousands of children had been exposed to the irreversible harm caused by lead poisoning,” said the report. “In Europe, countries such as France, Germany and Greece have been fined by the European Court of Justice for violating the regulatory limits for nitrates. Almost a third of monitoring stations in Germany present levels of nitrates exceeding the European Union’s limits.” “When it comes to what’s the cause of this problem, there are two forces,” Richard Damania, a World Bank senior economic advisor and a lead author of the report, told the Guardian. “The first is climate change, which affects both water quantity and quality. The second is population growth and production. The debate has always focused on the issue of quantity, but it becomes obvious when you look below the surface that there are thousands of pollutants. “We find that water pollution is a problem that affects both rich and poor countries, however the cocktail of chemicals changes as countries develop. In poor countries it is faecal bacteria and as GDP increases then nitrogen [from fertilisers] becomes the issue.” “Clean water is a key factor for economic growth,” added the World Bank Group president, David Malpass. “Deteriorating water quality is stalling economic growth, worsening health conditions, reducing food production, and exacerbating poverty in many countries. “Their governments must take urgent actions to help tackle water pollution so that countries can grow faster in equitable and environmentally sustainable ways.”",Global development; Access to water; World news; Water; Environment; World Bank; Business; Economics; Global economy,Global development
2019-10-10T11:00:19Z,Climate crisis: what the carmakers have to say,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/10/climate-crisis-what-carmakers-say,"Ford Motor Company “Ford takes its responsibilities for the environment and communities around the globe very seriously. That was evident again recently, when Ford was one of only four automakers reaching agreement with California on higher gas-mileage standards to reduce emissions. We have said multiple times that Ford does not support a rollback of federal emission standards. Additionally, Ford supports CO2 reductions consistent with the Paris climate accord, as we’ve shared publicly.” A spokesperson said the company endorsed the UN’s sustainable development goals, citing its heavy investment in vehicle electrification, “which we believe will facilitate long-term reductions in CO2 emissions”. The company cited the fact it was spending $11bn (£9bn) on electrified vehicles globally from 2017 through 2022 and has invested a further $500m to produce a new electric vehicle. It said in Europe it had announced plans for 17 electrified vehicles by 2023 that “will provide customer choice and deliver CO2 performance”. Toyota Motor Corporation “We are supportive of increasingly challenging targets to reduce vehicle greenhouse gas emissions while taking into account supportive or impeding factors such as technology capability, infrastructure development, consumer preference, fuel prices and other factors that can affect the take-up of ever cleaner technologies in the market ... “In regards to our membership in the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers in the United States, we believe it is important to take action as an industry as well as an individual manufacturer. Toyota continues to support year-over-year increases in standards but we believe adjustments are warranted to address changes in the assumptions used to establish those standards. “We will keep pushing for a sustainable agreement that sets progressive improvements in fuel economy, promotes advanced and diverse technologies and aligns with market realities and customer choice. “In Europe, thanks to our manufacturing presence in several EU countries, we are a member of the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) ... At ACEA, Toyota has specifically advocated for technology neutrality. We don’t believe the setting of specific sales quotas for certain types of zero-emission vehicles is the best mechanism to achieve the desired CO2 reduction targets. Instead … we believe the massive electrification of fleets using a variety of technologies adapted to a variety of consumer needs will be more successful.” Daimler “Sustainability is one of the essential elements of Daimler’s corporate strategy and at the same time, it is critical to our business success. As a global company, we have a responsibility to play our part in managing the transformation of our industry to one that is increasingly focused on sustainability by keeping the balance on several, complex dimensions: evaluating economic, ecological and social aspects, for customers and investors as well as for employees, business partners and society as a whole … “Regarding your question on matching the individual, worldwide CO2 regulations: it is our goal and intent to incorporate as many aspects as possible of Daimler’s goals and beliefs in the positions of associations both in the US and the EU. The conditionality principle which has been advocated for by the EU auto industry in the discussion on post-2020 CO2 targets in the EU can serve as an example for this.” BMW “The BMW Group welcomed the 2C goal of the Paris climate agreement and is committed to it. This was reinforced by CEO Oliver Zipse at the Frankfurt motor show in September. By 2020, we will have reduced the CO2 emissions of our European vehicle fleet by 50% in comparison with the 1995 base year. The BMW Group is currently working on new targets as part of a new sustainability strategy from 2020. “Our aim is to find a sustainable approach that meets all three requirements of sustainability (ecological, social, economic) in a balanced and appropriate manner. The BMW Group ultimately bears responsibility for more than 130,000 employees and their families. “The BMW Group has long been a champion of sustainability technology, encouraging its own industry and others to play their part in emissions reduction. We have been contributing ideas to decarbonise transport at multiple climate conferences worldwide since 2008 (since COP14) and through the company’s membership of various national and international associations. Within these associations, members naturally hold different positions on the climate debate. BMW plays its role in promoting electric mobility as a means to meeting the 2C goal of the Paris climate agreement. In our experience, constructive dialogue is the best way to bring about positive long-term changes.” General Motors “Our global commitment to improving fuel economy, reducing emissions and pursuing an all-electric zero-emissions future is unwavering, regardless of any modifications to existing emissions standards currently under review in the United States. In the US, we remain interested in working with all parties to advance American automotive technological leadership. Regardless of the standards, we are committed to a future of zero crashes, zero emissions, and zero congestion. The pathway to that vision includes continually improving fuel economy and our commitment to an all-electric future. This is why we’ve called for a US national zero-emissions vehicle programme. “Our zero-emissions vision extends beyond products to our manufacturing operations, where we have committed to use 100% renewable energy by 2050. “We set a new goal to reduce emissions by 31% by 2030 compared to a 2010 baseline, consistent with the level of decarbonisation required by science-based methodology. We have consistently reaffirmed these points with our global employees and other stakeholders, including policymakers, regulators and shareholders.” Fiat Chrysler Automobiles “FCA supports the policy choice in favour of ongoing fuel economy improvements in the fleet, but that policy needs to be based on market realities as they have evolved since 2012. In business and in government, we have to make decisions based on the best information available to us at the time, but we also must be nimble enough to adjust our plans when the facts on the ground change.”",Pollution; Environment; Automotive industry; Business; General Motors; Fiat Chrysler; Toyota; BMW; Ford; Green economy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Climate crisis,Environment
2019-09-19T05:00:24Z,"US-China trade war imperils efforts to beat poverty, warns Bill Gates",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/19/us-china-trade-war-imperils-efforts-to-beat-poverty-warns-bill-gates,"The ongoing trade battle between the US and China poses a major threat to efforts to tackle inequality and poverty, according to billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates. In an interview with the Guardian, the world’s second richest man said the economic conflict between the two superpowers could prove a “real setback” to solving some of the biggest global problems. “With the US-China relationship, if that really breaks down then that hurts the world economy and hurts the world’s ability to work together,” said Gates. “So that’s a real setback. I’m a huge believer in rich countries working together, especially when it’s to help poorer countries. But I don’t think the rise of this populist ‘every country for themselves’ rhetoric is the full picture. “I’m not trying to say we should ignore the rhetoric, but its partly that people don’t see that the co-operative efforts have had great results.” Speaking ahead of next week’s annual Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation’s goalkeepers event in New York, celebrating progress in global development during the annual gathering of world leaders at the UN general assembly, the Microsoft founder admitted that the ambitious targets set at the UN in 2015 “are looking unlikely” to be met. The 17 sustainable development goals, committed to by 193 world leaders four years ago, are a series of objectives to achieve three things by 2030: end poverty, fight inequality and injustice, and fix climate change. In the foundation’s own third annual goalkeepers data report, released this week, the data shows progress is being made on health and development, but that inequality remains a major barrier. “Its definitely a mixed story,” said Gates. The report shows vast improvements being made in child mortality around the world. Even in the worst-off parts of low- and low-middle-income countries, more than 99% of communities have seen an improvement in under five death rates and in schooling. But persistent gaps in opportunity mean that nearly half a billion people – one in 15 – still do not have access to basic health and education, while inequality between boys and girls means development investments aren’t reaching everyone. Using new, sub-national data, the report uncovers vast inequalities within countries that have been masked by averages. “Where you’re born is still the biggest predictor of your future, and no matter where you’re born, life is harder if you’re a girl,” said Gates. Despite gains in female education, opportunities for girls are limited by social norms, discriminatory laws and policies, gender-based violence and access to reproductive healthcare. But Gates resolutely refused to be pessimistic about progress. “Our optimism is more because of our nature,” he said. “It’s a global consensus to help others, and in no sense do I discern [political] polarisation could really hurt the consensus to innovate on behalf of the poorest. “The rhetoric in the US favours all of this ‘America first’ that has led the executive branch in the US to propose cuts to foreign aid, and even to effectively disengage budgets. That was very concerning, but what actually happened was that the congress chose not to cut. In the case of the medical research budget, they made a substantial increase. “For example, when I called President Macron a year ago and asked him to host the Global Fund this year, I had to be frank and say I didn’t know if we’d get the increase [in cash] we needed to fight malaria, TB and HIV. I didn’t know if Germany were going to come in with the increase we were asking for, I didn’t know if we were even going to be successful in getting everyone to the table, but in fact we saw a meaningful increase in commitment. “I can’t predict that this polarisation is going to go away, but I do predict that the human desire to help other people is not; it’s a very strong thing, and in the UK you have a powerful commitment to that. The Conservative party did preside over the aid budget going from 0.5% to 0.7% of gross national income, which was an amazing increase at a time when the budgets were tight. So while I know these things are up to the UK voters and the UK politicians, I haven’t seen that consensus that its important to help the poorest come apart.” Gates said that while things were getting better for people worldwide, the key issue now was inequality within countries, which would only be exacerbated by climate change. Bill and Melinda Gates will use the goalkeepers event to call for a new approach to development, targeting the poorest first, especially with healthcare, and supporting farmers to adapt to climate change. “Its absolutely right that, over time, climate change will front substantial problems for developing countries. Most of the poorest in these countries are farmers, so temperature extremes, floods and droughts will affect their ability to grow food and feed their families. Most of the focus has been on migration, but the foundation is very involved in adaptation – where the weather patterns will affect the poorest, helping them adapt,” said Gates,whose foundation has come under fire in the past for its investment in fossil fuels. Gates has said climate activists are wasting their time lobbying investors to ditch stocks, calling it a “false solution” that did not reduce emissions. They would do better to get behind the disruptive businesses like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, non-meat protein food companies he supports. After the Guardian spoke to Gates it was announced that a goalkeepers invitation had been extended to India’s president, Narendra Modi – intended to recognise his work in bringing better sanitation to India, but deeply controversial because Modi is accused of human rights abuses in Kashmir.",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Inequality and development; World news; Global development; Bill Gates,World news
2019-08-30T07:00:17Z,"With hajj under threat, it's time Muslims joined the climate movement",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/30/hajj-muslims-climate-movement-global-heating-pilgrims,"According to research published last week by US scientists, hajj is set to become a danger zone. As soon as next year, they say, summer days in Mecca could exceed the “extreme danger” heat-stress threshold. The news comes just weeks after over 2 million people completed their journey of a lifetime. The environmental threat to the holy pilgrimage is a panic button for British Muslims like me, signaling that the climate crisis is endangering an age-old sacred rite. Hajj is a pillar of Islam that I’ve yet to undertake, and the physical endurance required will only become more gruelling in coming decades – scientists predict that heat and humidity levels during hajj will exceed the extreme danger threshold 20% of the time from 2045 and 2053, and 42% of the time between 2079 and 2086. Environmental stewardship may well be advocated by my faith – the Quran states that humans are appointed as “caretakers of the Earth” and the prophet Muhammad organised the planting of trees and created conservation areas called hima – but it hasn’t mobilised Muslims on a mass scale for what the world needs now: a global eco-jihad. Fazlun Khalid, founder of Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environmental Sciences and author of Signs on the Earth: Islam, Modernity and the Climate Crisis, has been on a green mission for over 35 years, but his biggest challenge has been to motivate Muslims. “Islam is inherently environmental, but modernity has induced all of us to distance ourselves from nature. The reason I don’t give up is my grandchildren – what kind of planet will they inherit? How can they perform hajj under those conditions?” Khalid previously gathered a team of scholars and academics who drafted the Islamic declaration on climate change adopted at the International Islamic climate change symposium in Istanbul in 2015 (an event co-sponsored by Islamic Relief, a global charity that is again calling on Muslims to take action now if they want to safeguard the pilgrimage for future generations). Maria Zafar of Islamic Relief UK said: “Hajj has physically demanding outdoor rituals which can become hazardous to humans. It isn’t only Mecca, other sacred sites will be at risk too, like the religious sites in Jerusalem, the Golden Temple in India – it will affect what we hold dear to our hearts. We think that climate change is distant from us, but there is no area of life that it won’t touch.” If we are truly to tackle a catastrophe as huge as the climate crisis, we have to make it personal. Without a personal stake, it remains an abstract and we unite in perpetuating it. So if money is the only form of emotional investment for some, and if economics wields more power than the will to save our planet, we must use it. Next year Saudi Arabia is hosting the G20 summit, so let’s pressure the country to consider the financial threat due to a loss of religious tourism. Hajj is lucrative: economic experts have said revenues from hajj and umrah (a lesser pilgrimage undertaken any time of year) are set to exceed $150bn by 2022. “For the Saudis, hajj is more precious than oil,” says Dr Husna Ahmad, CEO of Global One, who’s been campaigning for a greener hajj for years. Ahmad created a green guide to hajj in 2011, and is now working on a green hajj app, which she plans to launch next year if funding is secured. With approximately 100m plastic bottles left behind each year after the pilgrimage ends, it’s clear that action is desperately needed. Slowly, Saudi authorities are beginning to implement a more environmentally friendly hajj by installing recycling points around the holy sites, and they aim to cut waste volumes by two-thirds by 2030. Pushing for change has been a struggle in the kingdom, but apathy is a wider problem. It’s bound up in socio-economic deprivation, and too often “saving the planet” is seen as something for the rich, a kind of green elitism. “Right now in the UK it feels like middle-class white women – and Sadiq Khan – are the only ones taking up the baton,” says Ahmad. “We know that climate change started with the European industrial revolution and poverty is inextricably linked to that. “People are trying to survive, you can’t blame them if climate change is not their priority. This is why achieving the UN sustainable development goals are high on my agenda.” The climate crisis does not exist in and cannot be tackled in isolation. While the big dogs must green-up their institutions and businesses, grassroots activists need better relations with governing bodies, more Muslims need to get involved with the broader debate and we all need to rethink our lifestyles – cut down on meat consumption, use less packaging and step back from throwaway consumerism. We all have a part to play – institutionally, socially, morally, economically and religiously. Whether it’s through the lens of our conscience, faith or finance, it’s imperative to find our own catalyst for action. If the threat to hajj can motivate Muslims, then that’s all for the good. • Remona Aly is a journalist and commentator",Climate crisis; Hajj; Islam; Religion; Saudi Arabia; Environmental activism,Opinion
2019-08-28T19:42:16Z,'Let's do it now': Greta Thunberg crosses Atlantic and calls for urgent climate action,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/28/greta-thunberg-arrival-in-new-york-delayed-by-rough-seas,"Greta Thunberg arrived in New York on Wednesday, stepping on to dry land after crossing the Atlantic in a sailboat with a passionate message to tackle global heating. Crowds had gathered to welcome her for hours beforehand, ready to welcome Thunberg’s arrival on the yacht which is designed to achieve zero-carbon status: propelled by wind, it uses solar panels and water-driven generators for its electricity. Under cloudy skies at a marina near the southern tip of Manhattan, Thunberg’s supporters greeted the teenager who sparked a series of walkouts by students protesting against the lack of action to address the climate crisis. At a press conference, Thunberg urged people to come together to tackle the climate crisis. “We need to stand together and take action because otherwise it might be too late.” To cheers from the crowd, she said: “Let’s not wait any longer. Let’s do it now.” She added: “It is insane that a 16-year-old would have to cross the Atlantic to take a stand … [against] the climate and ecological crisis is a global crisis and the biggest humanity has ever faced.” She also took a swipe at the US president, Donald Trump, a longstanding denier of the climate crisis. When asked if she had a message for Trump, she said: “I say, ‘Listen to the science’. And he obviously does not do that. If no one has been able to convince him about the climate crisis and the urgency, why would I be able to?” Thunberg docked at North Cove Marina on the edge of New York Harbor. The Marina is full of enormous yachts and sits right next to the Brookfield mall – a large glass dome filled with shoppers – which made for an opulent setting for the arrival of the climate change activist. Her vessel had been welcomed by a flotilla of 17 sailing boats, each with one of the 17 sustainable development goals written on their sails. The special welcome convoy will intercept Thunberg’s yacht near the Statue of Liberty off the top of New York City. Thunberg sailed to New York to attend a UN summit on zero emissions next month after refusing to fly there because of the carbon emissions caused by planes. She was offered a ride on the Malizia II racing yacht skippered by Pierre Casiraghi, the son of Princess Caroline of Monaco, and the German round-the-world sailor Boris Herrmann. The 16-year-old, whose school strikes have inspired children across the world to protest against the climate crisis, encountered some rough seas on her passage across the Atlantic and arrived later than expected. As Thunberg’s yacht rounded the Statue of Liberty, it was met by a flotilla of 17 support boats, each with its sail printed with a message spelling out a recommended sustainable development goal, as promoted by the United Nations. These included combating discrimination and promoting peace, as well as using less plastic, not wasting food or water, using public transportation and vaccinating children against diseases As Thunberg finally approached the harbor in New York, the crowds swelled. “I’ve been following her for the past year or so and am very enthusiastic about what she’s doing, how she’s got young people involved with the striking,” said Richard Walser, an IT technician who traveled down from Connecticut to welcome Thunberg with his son, CJ. Student Xiye Bastida, 17, said she was inspired by Thunberg’s activism to organize her own climate strike, involving 600 fellow students at her New York school. “She has a moral aspect to her message, that our generation will suffer the most. I hope she will raise the consciousness of climate change in the US – help wake people up,” she said. Bastida’s mobile phone carried a sticker saying “Greta has a posse”. One woman arrived at the marina clutching flowers and a placard that read “Welcome Greta”. The media was also out in force, including journalists from Chile, where world leaders will gather later this year for annual UN climate talks. Others, however, were nonplussed. One passerby asked if Thunberg was a solo round-the-world yachtswoman. Thunberg is set to travel to Chile for this event, although as yet it’s unclear how she will return home to Sweden given her aversion to flying due to its heavy fossil fuel use. Thunberg’s yacht left the British port of Plymouth on 14 August, and the teenager marked the first anniversary of the start of her school strike on 20 August. Greta began a sit-down protest outside the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to get members of parliament to act on climate change. She was quickly joined by other students around the world, as word of her strike spread through the media, and the “Fridays for future” movement was born. The 18-metre yacht features solar panels on its deck and sides, and two hydro-generators provide its electricity. Her voyage sparked controversy, however, after a spokesman for Herrmann, the yacht’s co-skipper, told the Berlin newspaper TAZ that several people would fly into New York to take the yacht back to Europe. Herrmann will also return by plane, according to the spokesman. Team Malizia’s manager insisted, however, that the young activist’s journey would be carbon neutral, as the flights would be offset. Greta has said she does not yet know how she will return to Europe. • This article was amended on 2 September 2019 to clarify a reference to the yacht being solar powered.

Released on 29 January, it’s breezy but heavy with lived emotion, Parks’s 12 songs locating a very British meeting place between torch songs and rhythm. US born, UK raised, Celeste has been ubiquitous in 2020, clocking up her first top 10 hit on a charity single. Finally, she drops her soulful and sophisticated full-length project, Not Your Muse, on 26 February. Kitty Empire Film: your cue to laugh again God knows, we all need a bit of light relief. Fortunately, there are plenty of comedy options on offer in the early part of 2021. First up is the scalding Promising Young Woman (12 February), a ballsy assault on rape culture written and directed by Killing Eve showrunner Emerald Fennell, and starring Carey Mulligan at the top of her always impressive game. Scheduled to stream on Amazon Prime in March is Coming 2 America, starring Eddie Murphy, reprising his role as Akeem, heir to the throne of Zamunda. Also due to launch on Amazon in the UK in early 2021 is Palm Springs, an inventive new spin on the Groundhog Day format that sees Andy Samberg trapped in an endlessly replaying wedding. Meanwhile, Michelle Pfeiffer gets her perfectly manicured nails into a dream of a role, as an ageing socialite in French Exit (26 February), which is based on the novel by Patrick DeWitt. Wendy Ide Radio: Emma Barnett on Woman’s Hour From 4 January, the redoubtable Emma Barnett will host Woman’s Hour every day from Monday to Thursday, with other presenters trying out on the Friday slot. It’s a big change for Barnett, who’s used to the rangy freedom of a three-hour show (her morning slot on 5 Live), with the peppy to-and-fro of political interviews and the spontaneity of listeners calling in. Woman’s Hour has long been far more sedate and tightly packaged. Now Barnett’s in, you have a feeling this may change. Miranda Sawyer Theatre: The Walk After the success of The Jungle, Good Chance joins forces with Handspring Puppet Company, which created War Horse, for a travelling festival in support of refugees, directed by Amir Nizar Zuabi. The star is a 3.5-metre-high puppet, Little Amal, a representative of displaced children, who on 30 March will set off to walk more than 8,000km, through 70 cities, towns and villages, from the Syrian-Turkish border to the UK, bringing together artists, cultural institutions and humanitarian organisations in one of the largest and largest-hearted public art works ever made. Follow the journey onlline: walkwithamal.org. Susannah Clapp Art: blockbusters Plague restrictions permitting, a resurgence of great exhibitions is due. First is the Royal Academy’s Francis Bacon: Man and Beast (currently scheduled for 30 January). Bacon painted dogs, hawks, monkeys and baboons as if they were human, and people as if they were creatures. Eventually the two become savagely indistinguishable. From 6 March, in Dürer’s Journeys, the National Gallery presents Albrecht Dürer as Europe’s first great tourist, drawing walruses in Belgium and whales in Zeeland. Witness the strange influence of Italy on his work. Tate Modern homes in on Australian art in the year 1992 (15 February) and the pioneering figures of Rodin (29 April), while Yorkshire Sculpture Park has Breaking the Mould, an epochal survey of women’s sculpture from Barbara Hepworth to Rachel Whiteread (13 March). In contemporary art, look out for the fantastical dreams of Kenyan-born painter Michael Armitage (Royal Academy from 13 March) alongside David Hockney’s evergreen spring paintings (from 27 March). And Yayoi Kusama’s mirrored Infinity Rooms return on 29 March, by popular demand, to baffle viewers at Tate Modern. Laura Cumming Classical: Hallé season The seven concerts in the Hallé orchestra’s winter/spring season, from Manchester’s Bridgewater Hall and Hallé St Peter’s, show variety and flair. The opener (14 January) features the poet laureate Simon Armitage and saxophonist Jess Gillam, conducted by Jonathon Heyward, with a world premiere, Where Is the Chariot of Fire, by Hannah Kendall. Pianist Isata Kanneh-Mason plays Beethoven (28 January); the Hallé’s rising star, assistant conductor Delyana Lazarova, conducts Shostakovich (25 February); Mark Elder conducts a staged performance of Stravinsky’s The Soldier’s Tale (18 March), directed by Annabel Arden.

The season ends with a world premiere from Huw Watkins, his Symphony No 2, and Boris Giltburg as solo pianist in Rachmaninoff’s Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini (25 March). Available online; a subscription services gives you access to them all. Fiona Maddocks Photography: Format 21 festival The main theme of this year’s Format photo festival in Derby is “control”, and the curators have sought, through an open call to photographers across the globe, to explore the concept in all its myriad forms. The contrasts are often dynamic. Highlights include Marco di Noia’s viscerally powerful images of the pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong and Heather Agyepong’s conceptual reimagining of the legacy of Aida Overton Walker, a popular African American vaudeville performer who challenged the casually racist stereotypes that dogged black performers in the early 1900s. As ever, a deftly curated festival that reflects the breadth of contemporary photography. Runs 12 March–11 April at various venues and online; see formatfestival.com. Sean O’Hagan Art: Matthew Barney The giant of US film art, famous for his visionary Cremaster Cycle, returns to Britain for the first time in over a decade with an epic new work set in Idaho’s Sawtooth Mountains. Redoubt, at London’s Hayward Gallery from 17 March, fuses classical, cosmological and American myths about humanity’s relationship with nature, and stars the artist himself in a snowbound choreography featuring animals, trees and elusive dancers. Hailed in the US as Barney’s most powerful work yet, it will be shown in a forest of sculptures. LC Art: Jean Dubuffet London’s Barbican gives us Brutal Beauty, the first show of this weird, wild and zany French painter in over half a century. His interest in raw art, the art of the mentally ill, and the untrained, from caveman to graffiti artist, fed directly into his brilliantly coloured and expressive work, using everything from tar and asphalt to spray paint and plaster. Expect to be startled by his spontaneity and the way his work seems to be the source of so much that followed. Opens 11 February. LC Dance: there will be dancing Winter’s plunges into high tiers for most of the country stopped a lot of dance plans in their tracks. Fortunately, Sadler’s Wells’ next showpiece was planned with the BBC for broadcast on iPlayer and the Sadler’s Wells website. Dancing Nation, on 14 January, is a one-day digital festival featuring three hour-long chunks of dance from some of Britain’s best companies. Highlights include Akram Khan and Natalia Osipova performing together for the first time in Mud of Sorrow: Touch, a revival of Matthew Bourne’s brilliant Spitfire, which mashes a ballet classic and an underwear advert, and a second outing for Shobana Jeyasingh’s Contagion, a reflection on coronavirus. Other performers include Birmingham Royal Ballet, English National Ballet, Oona Doherty and Boy Blue. Meanwhile, the enterprising Rosie Kay is hoping to relieve the gloom with a new production of Romeo + Juliet, told through the lens of gang culture in a stifling Birmingham summer in 2021. The topical and intriguing piece is due to premiere at the Birmingham Hippodrome on 17 March. Many fingers are very firmly crossed for its arrival. Sarah Crompton Audio: new podcasts Project 17, on the World Service from 20 January, is an ambitious series that features 17 17-year-olds from 17 countries. Each one will examine one of the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which were set in 2015. Have they worked? Are they being met? We begin with the engaging Lanre, in Leeds, who wants to know why a rich country like the UK can’t eradicate poverty... The Battersea Poltergeist, out on 21 January on BBC Sounds, tells the true story of 63 Wycliffe Road, an ordinary house in south London in 1956. Strange events start happening around a teenager, Shirley Hitchings. Are they caused by a poltergeist? Danny Robins presents (he speaks to an 80-year-old Shirley) and a high quality cast, including Toby Jones and Alice Lowe, recreate dramatic scenes, with spooky music by Nadine Shah and Ben Hillier. Not quite so spooky is Jon Holmes and chums’ new spoof true crime series, Cold Case Crime Cuts (due early February), which promises to thoroughly investigate crimes in songs, from Barry Manilow’s Copacabana to Bob Marley’s I Shot the Sheriff to Richard Marx’s Hazard. MS Film: documentaries If you’re ready for some heftier viewing after the distractions of the silly season, an influx of excellent documentaries awaits in early 2021. 15 January brings festival hit MLK/FBI, a gripping, eye-opening account of the FBI’s surveillance and interference in the activism of Martin Luther King through the 1950s and 60s, as well as the first essential documentary on the coronavirus pandemic, 76 Days, an emotionally pummelling fly-on-the-wall study of Wuhan hospital activity in the city’s early lockdown. If you’re after a lighter crowdpleaser, delicious doc The Truffle Hunters – a wry, gentle portrait of the elderly men pursuing the elusive Alba truffle in Italy’s Piedmont region – arrives in on 5 February. Things get serious again in March, with Oscar-winning director Bryan Fogel’s sharp, sobering The Dissident (5 March), a probing investigation of the disappearance and death of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul. After a year heavy on isolation, such documentaries offer a welcome reconnection with the world. Guy Lodge Pop: big hitters Details remain scant about Certified Lover Boy – Drake’s sixth studio album, due in January on OVO – but a moody trailer suggests a legend-building set, focusing on this rapper’s strongest suit: his many feelings. First scheduled for autumn 2020, Lana Del Rey’s long-awaited new outing, Chemtrails Over the Country Club, has no official release date due to a vinyl pressing delay, but a good guess would be March. KE Architecture: a Lambeth landmark A new home for a 400-year-old ecclesiastical library second only to the Vatican in importance. The new Lambeth Palace Library, due to open in March, by Wright &amp; Wright is a nine-storey brick tower that aims to protect the collections from flooding and fire risk, and make them more accessible, while minimising impact on the gardens of Lambeth Palace. It has already been battered on Twitter by conservative commentators who would like something more traditional. You could alternatively see it as a thoughtful response to a challenging brief. Meanwhile, the next instalment is due for The Illuminated River, the plan to make 14 Thames bridges into “a free outdoor art project” by Leo Villareal, the artist best known for bringing light and love to the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, forever the ugly sister of the Golden Gate. Four bridges have been animated by his slow-moving coloured lighting since July 2019. Early this year, five more will join them, from Blackfriars to Lambeth. Rowan Moore TV: Bloodlands Northern Irish noir, anyone? James Nesbitt stars in this cat-and-mouse BBC One crime thriller, written by exciting new talent Chris Brandon and produced by Jed Mercurio. When a car is pulled out of Strangford Lough in County Down, police detective Tom Brannick (Nesbitt) connects it to a cold case close to his heart. The four-parter follows his high-stakes hunt for an infamous assassin known as “Goliath”. Gripping, psychologically complex and shedding light on the legacy of the Troubles. Dates TBC. Michael Hogan Theatre: The Normal Heart Larry Kramer’s largely autobiographical play about the Aids crisis in New York in 1980 will be directed by Dominic Cooke as part of the Olivier-in-the-round season at the National Theatre. In this co-production with Fictionhouse, Ben Daniels stars as the founder of an Aids advocacy group, alongside Danny Lee Wynter, Daniel Monks and Stanley Townsend. The set will be designed by Vicki Mortimer and the lighting by Paule Constable. Dates TBC. SC Film: Vanessa Kirby Prepare to see a lot of Vanessa Kirby’s face over the next few months. The British star, formerly a standout in The Crown, will be in the thick of the Oscar race for her gut-wrenching performance as a grieving mother in Pieces of a Woman, while she’ll be on screens again on 5 March in The World to Come, director Mona Fastvold’s exquisite American period tale of two frontier wives who fall in love. GL Pop: The Weather Station You don’t need to be a fan of Canadian auteur Tamara Lindeman’s previous works to access her band’s extraordinary new album, Ignorance (5 February). This is leftfield pop, elegant and danceable, brimming with orchestral touches and jazz feints. It harks backwards to Talk Talk and the 80s, but is alarmed by the here and now. Songs that seem to be about lost love double as nuanced odes to the planet we are losing. KE Opera: Royal Opera’s Tosca After losing £3 out of every £5 of income during the pandemic, the Royal Opera House is taking no risks for its first full staging since last March: its 2021 season plans to open with Puccini’s passionate thriller Tosca in Jonathan Kent’s classic staging, with Russian superstar soprano Anna Netrebko in the title role, and tenor Yusif Eyvazov (Mr Netrebko) and bass-baritone Gerald Finley leading the first of three casts. Dates TBC; live stream currently scheduled for 22 January. FM TV: appointment comedy Mirth might be in short supply right now, but TV is at least serving up some laughs. David Tennant and Michael Sheen star in a second series of luvvies-in-lockdown comedy Staged on BBC One from 4 January. Although they’ll probably bicker over the order in which they’ve been named in that sentence. In mid-January comes Channel 4 reality series Stand Up &amp; Deliver, which sees five game-for-a-giggle celebrities trying their hand at standup comedy. The brave quintet includes Reverend Richard Coles, Happy Mondays frontman Shaun Ryder and former Conservative MP Baroness Sayeeda Warsi. Each will be paired with an established comic – David Baddiel and Zoe Lyons among them – who’ll train them to compete for top billing at a live gig. Spring brings the third run of BBC Two’s school-gates sitcom Motherland, and, finally, the fourth season of French comedy word-of-mouth hit Call My Agent! hits Netflix on 21 January. Expect A-list cameos and chic Gallic gags. MH Pop: Femi and Made Kuti double album Fela Kuti’s influence lives on with twice the punch, thanks to Legacy+ (Partisan, 5 February), a double release from son Femi and grandson Made. The former’s album, Stop the Hate, keeps his father’s political flame alive, while the latter – who studied music at Trinity Laban Conservatoire in London, just as his ancestor did – throws Afrobeat to the future on For(e)ward with a freshness that recalls UK jazz acts Ezra Collective and Kokoroko. Kate Hutchinson Film: Nomadland Chinese film-maker Chloé Zhao’s exquisite third film was a popular Golden Lion winner at Venice in the autumn, and went on to top many year-best lists across the pond (it’s released in the UK on 19 February). Blending documentary and narrative techniques, it stars Frances McDormand as an itinerant widow drifting across America, and merges her fictional story with the experiences of various nomads cast as themselves. The results are uniquely moving and adventurous: expect an armful of awards. GL Theatre: new plays New work brings the hope of spring. At Sheffield, writer Chris Bush and director Robert Hastie, who created the Sky Arts South Bank award-winning Standing at the Sky’s Edge, come together again for The Band Plays On, telling the Steel City’s recent history to a soundtrack of its music (Anthony Lau co-directs; 3–13 February). Paterson Joseph stars and, with Simon Godwin, co-directs his one-man show about the first black person of African origin to vote in Britain. Sancho: An Act of Remembrance is at the Lyric Hammersmith from 25 February–20 March. At Stratford East, Nadia Fall stages Dipo Baruwa-Etti’s The Sun, the Moon, and the Stars – about a young woman’s search for justice after her twin brother is murdered in a racist attack (3-20 February. The global online première of Lorien Haynes’s Good Grief, “a romantic comedy about grief”, can be seen from 15 February, featuring Sian Clifford and Nikesh Patel. Natalie Abrahami directs; Isobel Waller-Bridge composes the sound design and score. SC TV: It’s a Sin A new drama from Russell T Davies is always an event. His last two creations, after all, were Years and Years and A Very English Scandal. Now comes this long-gestating passion project, airing in late January on Channel 4. It charts the adventures of four friends throughout the 80s – the decade when everything changed for the gay community. Olly Alexander from Years &amp; Years (the pop band, confusingly, not the TV show) leads the young cast, supported by experienced hands Keeley Hawes, Stephen Fry and Neil Patrick Harris. MH Pop: live-streamed gigs from Paul Weller and Nadine Shah A socially distanced performance at London’s Barbican Hall that will also be broadcast online (6 February) promises to give Paul Weller’s works, old and new, a fresh dimension thanks to the BBC Symphony Orchestra, artistic-directed by Jules Buckley. As befits this restless, constantly evolving artist, sneak previews of songs from Weller’s forthcoming album, are also on the cards. Kitchen Sink, Nadine Shah’s jazz-goth fourth album, was one of 2020’s most provocative slow-burners, fixing its many guilty targets with an elegant death-stare. Shah – a south Tynesider with Norwegian and Pakistani heritage – will bring the album to life for the first time in its entirety as part of the live-streamed programme at the Barbican (30 March). Or as Shah puts it: “not any old shit-hole.” KE Art: V&amp;A season The V&amp;A in South Kensington gets off to a flying start this spring with winged horses, bronze busts of ancient kings and illuminated visions of paradise on Earth in its long-awaited blockbuster Epic Iran (from 13 February). Art from 5,000 years will represent this historic civilisation, drawn from pre-biblical times to contemporary painting and photography. This is followed by the spectacularly immersive exhibition Curiouser and Curiouser (from 27 March), a celebration of anything and everything related to Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. Taking in film, theatre, ballet, fashion, art and more, from illustrations by Tenniel and Dalí to costumes, movies and virtual recreations of Lewis Carroll’s scenes and characters, this will be a fantastical trip in itself. And at V&amp;A Dundee, the party continues with Night Fever: Designing Club Culture (from 27 March), exploring the way architecture and interior design merged with sound, light, fashion and graphic design in the evolution of nightclubs, including Studio 54, the Haçienda and the Ministry of Sound. LC TV: true crime With the likes of Des, Quiz and The Salisbury Poisonings proving big hits in 2020, the pipeline of fact-based crime drama shows no sign of slowing down. First to arrive is The Pembrokeshire Murders on ITV, starring Luke Evans as the detective on the trail of Welsh serial killer John Cooper (Keith Allen). On BBC Two is feature-length one-off Danny Boy, about real-life decorated soldier Brian Wood, accused of war crimes in Iraq by human rights lawyer Phil Shiner (Toby Jones), which resulted in the high-profile Al-Sweady inquiry. Finally, BBC One’s Four Lives tells the story of “Grindr Killer” Stephen Port from the perspective of his victims’ families. Stephen Merchant plays Port and Sheridan Smith co-stars. MH Film: Supernova Colin Firth and Stanley Tucci are both on peak form in this watercolour-delicate British tearjerker (5 March), playing a longtime couple rocked by the ravages of early-onset dementia. A road movie that follows them on what may be their last holiday to the Lake District, it’s as simple as it is devastating, and a breakthrough of note for writer-director Harry Macqueen. GL Pop: 90s Glasgow rises again Indie rock is one of Scotland’s most abundant natural resources. In an echo of Glasgow’s 90s pomp, three of the city’s most venerable (albeit now relocated) creative powerhouses have new projects due – on their own independent labels, naturally. Recorded during lockdown, Mogwai’s 10th album, As the Love Continues (19 February), maintains their sky-high quotient of “dreamlike grandeur”. Their more scabrous fellow travellers, Arab Strap, reunited in 2016 but only now deliver a new compendium of beat-laden gallows wit – As Days Get Dark (5 March), on Mogwai’s imprint, Rock Action. Balm comes in the form of deathless romantics Teenage Fanclub, Scotland’s answer to the Byrds, who present their 10th album, Endless Arcade (5 March). Gerard Love retired from the band in 2018, citing his reluctance to tour; his live replacement, former Gorky’s Zygotic Mynci frontman Euros Childs, rounds out this album’s poised mellifluousness. KE * * * Artists’ choices: cultural insiders on their highlights Lisa Dwan Stars in Samuel Beckett’s Happy Days at the Riverside Studios, London (February) and BBC One’s Bloodlands Three of my friends are releasing albums soons: Julia Stone with Sixty Summers; Imelda May, whose sixth album will include the brilliant single 11 Past the Hour; and Thomas Bartlett with Songs By My Friends. I’m really looking forward to the new Rachel Cusk novel Second Place, Susie Boyt’s Loved and Missed and Tracy K Smith’s new collection Such Color. The BBC’s Lights Up (which I am involved in) is bringing newly recorded stage productions to TV, and I’m particularly looking forward to the world premiere of David Ireland’s Sadie in February. Adam Kay His latest book, Kay’s Anatomy, was published last year and a TV series of his diary, This Is Going to Hurt, is currently in production Almost every opportunity to get out of the house in early 2021 looks rather TBC, so I’m focused on sofa-based entertainment. I’m particularly looking forward to Russell T Davies’s epic drama It’s a Sin, about the lives of young people during the Aids epidemic in 1980s London. The crisis was ignored for too long and, despite the loss of so many gay men, is often forgotten now. Russell’s unmatched skill at weaving humour with emotional gut-punches reassures me this important story is in safe hands. David Lan Former artistic director of the Young Vic theatre and a producer of Good Chance’s The Walk, which will see a giant refugee puppet journey across Europe from March A producer friend says the great thing about her life these days is she can plan far more ambitious shows than she’d ever dreamed of, because government advice will change and she’ll have to cancel them. I want to go to the theatre; I don’t really care what it is, provided the house is packed and abuzz with expectation, and there’s that rush of silence as the lights go down and an actor says something funny or alarming and you’re out of your life and in it. Manuela Moscoso Curator of the 11th edition of the Liverpool Biennial, The Stomach and the Port, 20 March–6 June In these challenging times I want to enrich my sense of togetherness critically, so I will be directing my attention towards The Showroom – one of the most exciting and cutting-edge art organisations in London, which focuses on collaborative approaches. In spring 2021, Beirut artist Haig Aivazian will hit the London art scene. Haig has a particular way of exploring how power moves people, architecture or landscape. I can’t wait. Alicaì Harley Singer and rapper, whose debut EP, The Red Room Intro (Yard Gyal Inna Britain), is out early this year I love how versatile Drake is sonically and especially when he’s collaborated with the likes of Popcaan, Rihanna and Wizkid – it shows that he definitely champions African and Caribbean culture, which I can really appreciate because of my Jamaican background. We’ve had a taste of what will come from the new album, Certified Lover Boy (out in January), with the track Laugh Now, Cry Later, which feels a bit more like old-school Drake. I’m excited for what the album will bring (especially the memes).",Culture; Film; Theatre; Dance; Art; Television; Radio; Pop and rock; Classical music; Photography; Podcasts; Documentary films; Architecture; Television & radio; Alice Lowe; David Lan; Romeo and Juliet,Culture
2019-01-10T00:01:25Z,"Appoint minister for hunger to tackle UK food insecurity, MPs urge",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/10/appoint-minister-for-hunger-to-tackle-uk-food-insecurity-mps-urge,"MPs are urging the government to appoint a minister for hunger in the UK to tackle the growing problem of food insecurity, which is affecting one in five children. The Commons environmental audit committee has accused the government of “turning a blind eye” to hunger and criticised ministers for treating hunger as an “overseas” issue, despite evidence that the UK has among the worst levels of food insecurity in Europe. The committee heard evidence that more than 2 million people in the UK were food insecure – meaning they struggled to eat regularly and healthily – with an estimated 19% of all under-15’s living with moderately or severely food insecure adults. Nearly 2 million people in the UK may be undernourished, including up to a third of people admitted to hospital, up to 42% admitted to care homes and a fifth of those received into mental health units, the committee says. It calls on the government to appoint a minister with accountability for tackling hunger in the UK. “Despite the need for joined-up cross-government action, hunger and food insecurity has fallen between the cracks in government plans,” it says. “We are concerned at the government’s turning a blind eye to UK hunger and its lack of progress in measuring and acting upon hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition in the UK.” Benefit delays and sanctions related to universal credit are highlighted by the committee as key drivers of hunger alongside cuts to social care. Food bank use has increased by 52% in areas where universal credit has been rolled out for longer than 12 months, its report says. The report cites a defence of universal credit by the junior work and pensions minister Justin Tomlinson, who says the new benefit offers “personalised, tailored support, helping get the money to the most vulnerable people in society, which then leads into tackling the issue of food insecurity”. The report is withering in its response: “We find the minister’s optimism about the universal credit system to be misguided and ill-judged.” The UK is a signatory to the UN Sustainable Development Goals agenda, adopted in 2015, which aims to end hunger and ensure access to safe and nutritious food. The agenda applies to developed and developing countries alike. MPs say the government is failing to meet its international commitments. Meanwhile, the National Federation of Women’s Institutes (NFWI) has added its voice to the call for government action to tackle food insecurity. A survey of more than 4,000 women’s institute volunteers said more than two-thirds had donated to food banks and community food aid projects in the past month. Ann Jones, the vice-chair of the NFWI and chair of its public affairs committee, said: “Historically, the WI was at the frontline of supplying food to a country ravaged by war; but today it is clear that WI members are battling to tackle food insecurity on a very different front – via donations to food banks and soup kitchens. “Food poverty is a very real issue, and we have found from our survey that WI members are taking the initiative and donating to food banks and other organisations in their communities. Whilst it is heartening to see the public stepping in like this, this is really just a sticking plaster and there is only so much that can be expected from civil society.” A government spokesperson said: “Household incomes have never been higher and the number of children living in workless households is at a record low, but we know there’s more to do to ensure that every family has access to nutritious, healthy food.” Child Poverty Action Group’s chief executive, Alison Garnham, said: “We already have a minister responsible for our social security system which, on any basic understanding of its role, is meant to prevent poverty, destitution and hunger in this country. That we should need reminding of the UN’s sustainable development goals in such a rich country is a scandalous development.” Anna Taylor, the executive director of the Food Foundation thinktank, said: “The EAC is right to state the urgency of a comprehensive national response to household food insecurity in the UK. We need an approach that considers the shared causes and consequences of food insecurity, hunger, malnutrition and obesity.”",Poverty; Food banks; Social exclusion; Society; Politics; UK news,Society
2019-11-03T06:00:07Z,Give older people a voice on housing | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/03/give-older-people-voice-housing-observer-letters,"Housing that is well designed for ageing is of paramount importance in a society where numbers over the age of 85 are set to double in the next 25 years (“The solution for an ageing UK? Build new almshouses”, News). A “new almshouse movement” is welcome, but one essential element of this approach must be a transformation of its culture. The heritage of centuries has been deeply paternalistic, with older people viewed as “beneficiaries” of the decisions taken on their behalf by the good and worthy who populate almshouse boards. “Co-production partnership” is a notion taking hold very slowly, whereby the end-users of new schemes have a real voice and are involved in the development from the outset, and power is not concentrated on high but shared. The residents of a new almshouse will be those who were young in the 1960s and 1970s – they are used to having a say. The example given of the Older Women’s Cohousing project in High Barnet offers a compelling contrast, run entirely by themselves without external patronage. A new almshouse movement would be a wonderful thing, but it needs to borrow concepts such as individual and group autonomy, collective decision-making and co-production from the community-led housing movement if it is to be truly modern. Maria Brenton, UK Cohousing London SW6 Food for thought, Rees-Mogg Two years ago, that lovely Christian man Jacob Rees-Mogg described the massive increase in the number of food banks as “uplifting” and a sign of a compassionate society. I wonder if he has a similar sense of uplift on hearing evidence given by desperate mothers to the inquiry into universal credit that they were selling sex to buy food for their children (“A welfare system that drives mothers into prostitution is no safety net”, Comment). Sarah James Monmouth GM rice is not so golden Your article on GM rice was one-sided and simplistic (“Block on GM rice ‘has cost millions of lives and led to child blindness’”, News). Golden rice represents a “magic bullet” solution to a complex problem, much like the introduction of cane toads to Australia to control beetle pests. The UN’s sustainable development goals teach us that we need a more systematic approach to tackling problems such as child malnutrition. Children are deficient in vitamin A in many countries because they don’t have access to vegetables. That means they’ll be deficient in many other nutrients, which golden rice will not tackle, a lack that will continue to do significant damage to their health. Plus, consider economic and social factors: if golden rice is promoted as healthy and essential for children, it will be more expensive than “ordinary” rice. The children who most need it are unlikely to get it. Studies last year showed that paddy rice cultivation can emit twice as many greenhouse gases as previously thought, providing further impetus to moving in the direction demanded by the World Health Organization, towards producing twice the amount of fruit and vegetables we currently do to ensure a minimally healthy diet for every human being. A “business as usual with a bit of added technology” alleged solution to our problems is unlikely to meet the social, economic and environmental crises we face. Natalie Bennett, Green party peer and former leader Sheffield Robin McKie’s article was a stark factual reminder of the potential societal benefits of GM technologies. However, it is probably appropriate to stop the blame game that has focused on GM. This argument has blighted potentially constructive discussion between “agricultural” and “environmental” interests that should be moving forward together to develop environmentally compatible agriculture capable of producing healthy food for all. Many of us involved in advancing the food security agenda believe passionately that our work has to proceed hand in hand with safe technology and that progress has also to stand the test of environmental sustainability. The time has come to evaluate technologies objectively for their safety, and ask ethical questions about their deployment. This approach will require a coming together of all interest groups around what must be common themes about which there can be little debate: a climate emergency and the urgent need to figure out a way to feed two billion more people healthily by 2050. Dale Sanders, director John Innes Centre Norwich It’s a freelancer’s life It’s not just actors who at times need other employment (“Was it necessary to shop Katie Jarvis for working in a shop?”, Comment). Some years ago, as a freelance writer, I sought another job and became a television subtitler. Hearing about my new job (whose aim is to enable deaf people to enjoy their chosen TV programmes), a small but significant number of literary colleagues expressed pity and obvious embarrassment at what they clearly saw as loss of caste. At one university where I was invited (still wearing my writer’s hat) to speak on a literary topic, I was discreetly urged by my hosts not to mention my current employment lest it lower my status in the eyes of my audience. “Gig economy” is a new term for what has always been financial reality for freelance actors, writers, artists and musicians. Katie Jarvis’s situation is just one example of the multitasking needed to maintain a creative career. I wish her good luck – and lots of gigs. Zoe Fairbairns London SE19 EU is our partner, not ruler It seems that Dan Rainey is confused as to how the EU works (“Why I voted Leave”, Letters). The EU has nothing to do with how we run our NHS, police, education, local authorities, housing, social services or taxes. The EU does not “rule” us – we are equal partners. Boris Johnson did not have to rush over to Brussels to ask what he should put in the Queen’s speech. Mr Rainey seems to believe that the lack of attention to deprived northern areas was because of the EU parliament, when we all know of the harm done in the 1980s by the Thatcher government and austerity policies after the financial crash. One of the EU’s main policies has been, and still is, to get funds to the deprived areas of Europe, including in the UK. Janet Davies Hartley Wintney, Hampshire No Spanish practices please You state that Britain “badly needs a dose of Spanish-style candour about its history” (“Spain confronts its past. Other countries should follow its lead”, Editorial). This is an overly kind interpretation of Spain’s past and current approach to fascism and dissent. Far-right groups are tolerated by politicians and the national police, as witnessed by the scenes at Franco’s exhumation and, more violently, on the streets of Barcelona in counter-demonstrations. Francoism remains alive in the judiciary and police. This has again been demonstrated by the harsh and provocative crackdown on Catalan leaders and the reaction to the resulting protests. The disinterment of Franco is long overdue. However, the removal of the dictator’s influence is a more pressing matter for today’s Spain. Andrew Poyner Stamford, Lincs An age-old problem Torsten Bell’s analysis of voting patterns is just one example of how Britain is divided by age (“Age, not class, has come to define how Britain votes”, Comment). Ours is one of the most age-segregated countries and this has led to a host of social and economic problems, from loneliness and ageism to housing, health, care and education. The next government must bring Britain together. More mixing between the generations will build stronger communities and a stronger country.

2019-07-21T12:08:28Z,Ex-Unilever boss seeks 'heroic CEOs' to tackle climate change and inequality,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/21/ex-unilever-boss-seeks-heroic-ceos-to-tackle-climate-change-and-inequality-paul-polman,"The former boss of Unilever is seeking a team of “heroic chief executives” to drive a shift to a low-carbon, more inclusive way of doing business. Paul Polman, who stepped down from the Anglo-Dutch owner of Marmite and Dove in November last year after a decade at the helm, warns that the rise of populism and Brexit are symptoms of capitalism’s failure to adapt. Bosses, he insists, must commit to fighting inequality and tackling the climate emergency. “We are about to commit the biggest intergenerational crime in the history of mankind. We need to bring us together not drive us apart,” said the 63-year-old Dutchman, who won plaudits for pushing the benefits of sustainable business long before it became fashionable. “If you don’t address inequality and climate change, to keep it simple, a lot more people are going to be dissatisfied, feel not included or left behind, and making these choices of rejection at the ballot box. The fact we are having these issues of populism and schisms in society is exactly because we are not addressing the underlying issue to evolve capitalism and make sure it works for everybody,” he said. He believes the starting point is “heroic chief executives willing to step up and move outside of the comfort zone and take personal risks. I tried to do the same with Unilever. It’s a matter of willpower.” Polman has backed his words with cash by investing in Imagine, a foundation to push the UN’s sustainable development goals. But he has several other projects on the go, including helping the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and François-Henri Pinault, the boss of Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent owner Kering, to develop a fashion-industry deal to cut waste and carbon emissions that is set to be announced at the G7 meeting in Biarritz next month. Polman said the aim is to get a fifth of the industry on board. He his hoping that signatories including the Calvin Klein owner PVH, H&amp;M and Inditex, the owner of Zara, will inspire others. Polman is also backing an initiative that adopts similar tactics to advance disability rights, Valuable 500. The campaign, which is aiming to recruit 500 chief executives of major companies who commit to putting disability on their board agenda this year, has just won the backing of seven major financial institutions, including the Bank of England, HSBC and Lloyds. The banks join existing signatories, including Barclays, Accenture, Microsoft, Virgin Media and Sainsbury’s. “We are trying to create tipping points on a sectorial level. The premise is that chief executives in the private sector need to drive major change in the absence of politicians doing it right now. Not exclusively but actively helping de-risk the political process,” Polman said. “Over the next 10 years more responsibility will be put on business to move faster to implement the [UN’s] sustainability goals simply because of financial flow that needs to happen that cannot come right now from government.” With only 100 companies responsible for 71% of carbon emissions , persuading a handful of these bosses to see the economic and moral benefit of changing their ways can create a race to the top, according to Polman. The boss who has publicly backed the young people behind Extinction Rebellion and is a fan of the teenage activist Greta Thunberg, said businesses that do not embrace issues of diversity, sustainability and equal rights will also struggle to attract talented young workers. “Millennials want to work for companies that stand for more than just making money.” Polman said he is no longer ridiculed for suggesting that tackling climate change makes business sense and that companies are also beginning to see that addressing equal rights is just as important. “We are now at a point in society where the cost of not acting in these areas is higher than acting. It is becoming mainstream. It comes down to humans, that’s the missing element,” Polman said. Caroline Casey, the founder of the Valuable 500 campaign, hopes that persuading key business leaders, such as Richard Branson, who has dyslexia, to be more open about their own disabilities and take action to make their companies more inclusive will demonstrate change is “good for business, good for people with disability and good for society in general”. She points out that there are about 13m people with disabilities in the UK who, together with their families, have a spending power of £249bn. However, businesses pay them far less attention than vegans, for example, who number less than one million. People with disabilities are also valuable employees who may be concealing non-obvious conditions such as autism, mental health problems or even blindness in the workplace. “There’s a cost to exclusion because we’re not releasing potential,” Casey said.",Business; Unilever; Climate crisis; Inequality; Bank of England; Greta Thunberg; HSBC; Lloyds Banking Group; World news; Europe; UK news,Business
2019-08-25T10:02:41Z,The west takes its eyes off Africa at its peril | Larry Elliott,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/25/g7-the-west-takes-its-eyes-off-africa-at-its-peril,"Time was when Africa dominated gatherings of the G7. In the period between two summits held in the UK – Birmingham in 1998 and Gleneagles in 2005 – the talk was of little else. There was public activism and it led to political action. In part, that was because the big developed countries were enjoying a spell of low-inflationary growth and could look beyond their own problems to see a bigger picture. There was the occasional financial panic, but the G7 thought the problems of economic management had largely been solved and all that was needed was a bit of tinkering by technocratic central bankers. Once it turned its attention to other parts of the world, the G7 found much that needed attention. There were initiatives to reduce the burden of debt, to increase aid, to improve governance and to free up trade. It helped that the UK at the time had a prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer – Tony Blair and Gordon Brown – who were committed to the cause and prepared to chivvy along the more reluctant members of the G7. Gleneagles was the culmination of the process. Public awareness was at its height and was marshalled effectively by the development movement. G7 countries talked the talk with a big package of aid and debt relief. Africa, it was thought, was sorted. Time to move on to other issues. As it turned out, the G7 was living in a fool’s paradise. It hadn’t found the secret to trouble-free growth, as the financial crisis that erupted two years after Gleneagles conclusively proved. And it certainly hadn’t sorted all Africa’s problems, even though economic management generally improved and some countries – Ethiopia, for example – grew strongly. The west took its eyes off Africa as it focused on its own problems. China, hungry for natural resources, moved in to commodity-rich African countries and provided infrastructure on a no-questions-asked basis. Countries that were rich in natural resources borrowed in the expectation that high oil and mineral prices would be sustained but, when they weren’t, growth slowed and debt problems resurfaced. Since the Gleneagles summit, the west, for the most part, has become more alive to the risks of global heating; fences have put been erected to keep out migrants; a meeting of the G7 never goes by without a commitment to keep fighting terrorism. Yet it doesn’t take a genius to work out that escaping poverty is the motivation for migrants to travel to the west, or that the failure of poor countries to provide their young adults with decent jobs breeds extremism. Birth rates are higher in poor countries, with the result that rising populations put pressure on the natural environment. All these problems are particularly acute in Africa. Even the biggest and longest walls in the world are not going to prevent poor people being lured to the west. No amount of security is going to keep societies safe from the young and angry. And any attempts to reduce carbon emissions in developed nations are going to be irrelevant if – as seems inevitable – Africa’s hunger for energy rises exponentially as its population grows. And Africa’s demographic trends are truly scary. Of the 2.4 billion increase in the world’s population between 2015 and 2050, it is estimated more than half (1.3 billion) will come from Africa. New research to be published later this week by the charity Save the Children UK and the Overseas Development Institute thinktank sums up well the risks of ignoring or underplaying Africa’s problems. That, the report says, is precisely what is happening, even though one of the United Nations 2015 sustainable development goals was a collective pledge to eradicate extreme poverty – defined as living on less than $1.90 a day – for all people everywhere. That promise will nowhere near be met on current trends. In particular, it will be broken for African children, with the SCUK/ODI research estimating that more than 300 million sub-Saharan African children will be living in extreme poverty by 2030. Birth rates are coming down, but slowly and at a less rapid pace than in other parts of the world. On average, the report notes, mothers in Africa give birth to four to five children, pushing the continent’s share of global births from about 29% today to a projected 36% by 2030. However, at the same time poverty has fallen more slowly in Africa than other regions, with an estimated 40% of the population living on less than $1.90 a day. Last year, African children accounted for 44% of world poverty; by 2030 it will be 55%. As Kevin Watkins, chief executive of SCUK, notes: “Put simply, the world’s population of children is increasing most rapidly in the region where poverty is coming down most slowly. These trends are unfolding in full view of the governments who have pledged to eradicate poverty – yet their response to child poverty has been a case study in inertia.” The SCUK/ODI study is pretty unsparing in its conclusions. It found little evidence of African governments developing coherent policy responses to growing child poverty. And the paper criticised the IMF, the World Bank and other donors for failing to put child poverty at the top of their agendas. It’s not hard to see what this agenda should be: pro-poor redistributive growth; higher public spending on health and education; investment in family planning. African child poverty matters. It is an affront to the children who are suffering and it is a time bomb primed to go off under the west.

2019-04-21T04:59:43Z,Housing poverty is a moral disgrace | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/21/letters-housing-poverty-moral-disgrace,"Tom Wall’s piece on housing poverty in Weston-super-Mare brought into sharp focus what many of us living here have known for a long time (“Trapped in Britain’s new slums”, Special report). The crisis is the fault both of central government, for replacing the system of rents being paid directly to landlords with universal credit, leaving the poorest tenants with the stark choice between eating or paying rent, and of North Somerset council. Landlords and tenants alike had security under the old system and it was naive of the government to think that everyone was capable of managing their finances unaided. Councillor Elfan Ap Rees, a leading member of the Conservative cabinet within the council that makes all the big decisions, may speak blandly about there being no slum tenure but the facts belie this. He promises more inspections but who will do this, since council jobs have been cut and in some cases trading standards officers are having to act as environmental health officers? By refusing to institute mandatory licensing for landlords, North Somerset council has given carte blanche to rogue operators who, frankly, treat tenants as scum. The situation is a moral disgrace and one that, I am certain, is replicated in many towns and cities in austerity Britain. Brian Price Weston-super-Mare North Somerset Aid should help the poorest As people of faith, our values compel us to speak out for the world’s most vulnerable people. We have come together ahead of the comprehensive spending review to urge the government to maintain the aid budget and protect the quality of UK aid. In 2015, faith communities were proud of the UK’s commitment to the sustainable development goals. We must keep our promise to the world’s poorest. We believe that Britain has a moral responsibility to continue to provide 0.7% of gross national income in aid, and to influence other governments to do likewise. While the world has seen unprecedented progress in tackling extreme poverty, there is still a long way to go to meet the sustainable development goals by 2030. The UK has a proud record of supporting international development and is well respected around the world. It is critical that we continue this leadership and generosity. We also are extremely concerned to ensure that the primary focus of British aid remains poverty alleviation and that we deliver the highest quality aid programmes to the world’s most vulnerable people. We add our voices to many in asking for reassurances that the government will prioritise providing aid to the least developed countries, ensuring the proportion they receive is protected from further decline. British aid programmes should prioritise vital social sectors such as health and education, promote gender equality, protect the environment and support local solutions to build capacity and increase sustainability. To have confidence that aid is being spent effectively, we also need to know what the government is doing in our name. All aid programmes should be fully transparent and accountable. We pray to the government that its discernment and compassion for the poorest and most marginalised will guide its work.

You’ll be lucky With regard to developments in artificial intelligence/robotics, Ian McEwan’s concern is that “we are in the process of handing over responsibility… for ethical decisions to machines” (Interview, New Review). McEwan presents this as a dilemma for programmers in terms of, for instance, whether AI can be programmed to lie. The issue in fact is whether we are competent to programme AI in this regard at all. Let’s equate ethics with empathy. Robots can be programmed to exhibit or refute empathy. More than likely, once programmed, they will be unable to hypocritically avoid and assuage ethical concerns in the way we do. So the ethical and political battles will be around how to ensure they are programmed to display empathy and act ethically and which individuals and institutions make the decisions about the content of the programming. Nick Moss London NW10 Children are still suffering The National Education Union report on child poverty exactly reflects what the UN special rapporteur, Philip Alston, found in 2018 (“Tired, hungry and shamed: pupil poverty ‘stops learning’”, News).

Dr Richard Turner Beverley, East Yorkshire Home birth is best Contrary to Barbara Ellen’s opinion, choosing to start your labour at home in peace and comfort with an experienced midwife or two is the best way to maximise your chances of a normal, uncomplicated outcome (“Meghan’s home birth should not blind us to the risks for most women”, Comment). Our home birth team, for example, has the lowest rate of postpartum haemorrhage and obstetric anal sphincter injuries in our NHS trust. Yesterday, two first-time mums welcomed their babies into the world in their own homes. Both had physiological births, neither of which incurred any complications or need for pain relief. Maria Mills Shaw Community midwives office Epsom &amp; St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust Carshalton, Surrey So much for risk taking We are told that it is the buccaneering spirit of risk takers such as Richard Branson that makes private firms so much more innovative and productive than nationalised ones (“How (gravy) train operators still make millions while failing to pay their way”, Business leader). Yet as soon as a risk crops up that isn’t backed up 100% by taxpayers’ hard-earned cash, they run crying for a nanny state to insure them. If only the state can provide proper pensions for people with a lifetime’s service on the trains, let’s have state railways, as our EU neighbours do. Nik Wood London E9 Beating Einstein to it Regarding Tim Adams’s article (“How our capacity for wonder was challenged by the black hole image”, Comment): the first published scientific hypothesis regarding the existence of black holes was actually in 1783, more than 100 years before Einstein’s work, by John Mitchell, a Yorkshire clergyman. He called them Dark Stars. Sean McGibbon Kilkenny, Ireland Suppository supposition I enjoyed Mark Kermode’s review of Wild Rose (Film of the week, New Review) but was taken aback by screenwriter Nicole Taylor’s observation that country music is popular in Scotland because “it’s like a suppository for the emotionally constipated”. Perhaps Taylor’s comments were tongue in cheek; however, I suggest she spends more time north of the border getting to know the locals. Scots rarely require laxatives (or country music) to shake off their inhibitions and they are even known to be openly welcoming to visitors, including from England.

Plunging commodity prices, a stronger dollar and rising US interest rates had combined to increase debt repayments by 85% between 2010 and 2018, the JDC said. The bid to reduce the unaffordable debts of the world’s poorest countries was prompted by grassroots activism in the late 1990s and early 2000s, first with the Jubilee 2000 campaign and then with Make Poverty History. But the financial position of many developing nations has again deteriorated in recent years. Repayments account for more than 12% of government revenue on average, the highest level since 2004, the year before the G8 summit held at Gleneagles agreed a comprehensive package of financial assistance involving aid and debt relief. The International Monetary Fund has become increasingly concerned at the financial vulnerability of poor countries and will discuss the issue at its spring meeting in Washington DC next week. Two-fifths of low-income countries are assessed by the IMF to be at “elevated risk of debt distress”, a doubling since 2013. Tim Jones, the JDC’s head of policy, said: “The growing debt crisis needs urgent international attention. A vital first step is to require that all loans to governments are publicly disclosed, allowing parliaments, media and civil society to hold governments to account for new borrowing. “In addition, when crises arise, the IMF should stop bailing out reckless lenders, and require debts to be reduced instead, so that the costs of crises are shared between borrower and lender. All too often, the lenders who helped to cause the crisis are bailed out, while all the costs of irresponsible lending are borne by people in the borrowing country. “There is now evidence of falling public spending in countries hit by high debt payments, further undermining progress towards the sustainable development goals.” External loans to developing country governments more than doubled from $191bn (£14.5bn) in 2008 to $424bn in 2017, the latest year for which figures are available. Calculations by the JDC found that in the 15 countries with the highest debt payments, public spending per person fell in 10 of them between 2016 and 2018. In oil-rich Angola, which was hit by the collapse in the cost of crude in the mid-2000s, debt payments were 57% of government revenue in 2018, while public spending was cut by 19% between 2016 and 2018. Cameroon has cut spending by 20% and Egypt by 23% after their repayments rose to 30% and 20% of government revenue respectively. All three countries are on IMF programmes. Across the 15 countries with the highest repayments, public spending fell by an average of 4%. In contrast, of the 15 countries with the lowest debt payments, public spending per person fell in just two between 2016 and 2018. On average across these 15, public spending increased by 11%.",Global economy; Debt relief; Business; Economics; Society; Africa; World news,Business
2019-03-28T10:06:51Z,Housing in sub-Saharan Africa improves but millions of people live in slums,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/mar/28/housing-in-sub-saharan-africa-improves-but-millions-of-people-live-in-slums,"From cities to the countryside, Africa has undergone a dramatic transformation in living conditions over the past 15 years, according to a new study. But the research, based on state of the art mapping and published in science journal Nature, also found that almost half of the the urban population – 53 million people across the countries analysed – were living in slum conditions. Led by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the study offers the first detailed estimate of housing quality in sub-Saharan Africa. Using the most recent data available from 31 countries, researchers found housing had improved across several measures over a 15-year period. Sufficient living area, improved water and sanitation and the durability of construction were found across 23% of houses in 2015, up from 11% in 2000. The study’s senior author, Dr Samir Bhatt from Imperial College London, said: “Our study demonstrates that people are widely investing in their homes, but there is also an urgent need for governments to help improve water and sanitation infrastructure. “We saw a doubling in the number of people living in an improved house. This parallels the success stories we are seeing in terms of Africa’s development. It is supported by a wide variety of other studies that show that when people get sufficient income, one of the things they do is invest in their homes.” Bhatt said the improvement will have a “huge impact” on people’s health and susceptibility to disease. “You can give someone a mosquito net with insecticide, but having a window you can close makes a huge difference,” he said. The study found the need for adequate housing to be “particularly acute” in Africa, since the continent has the fastest growing population in the world, predicted to rise from 1.2 billion people in 2015 to 2.5 billion people by 2050. The improvement was highest in Botswana, Gabon and Zimbabwe. South Sudan, Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo were among countries where progress was less marked. The researchers found that improved housing may be linked to economic development. Improved housing was 80% more likely among more educated households and twice as likely in the wealthiest households, compared with the least educated and poorest families. The new data could guide interventions to achieve universal access to safe and affordable housing and to upgrade slums by 2030, one of the UN’s sustainable development goals. Dr Lucy Tusting, who conducted the work while at the malaria atlas project, University of Oxford, said: “Adequate housing is a human right. Remarkable development is occurring across the continent but until now this trend this had not been measured on a large scale.” The UN definition of a slum household is one that does not protect against extreme weather, has more than three people to a room, lacks access to safe water and adequate sanitation, and has no security of tenure. The researchers, who examined 600,000 households using an innovative technique that allowed the prevalence of different house types to be mapped across the continent, defined housing as “improved” if it had the first four conditions, but did not look at security of tenure.",Global development; Access to water; Sanitation; Housing; Africa; World news,Global development
2019-06-08T06:00:12Z,Aid groups need a major shake-up to meet the challenges of a fractured world | Simon O’Connell,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jun/08/aid-groups-need-a-major-shake-up-to-meet-the-challenges-of-a-fractured-world,"It is just over three years since the “Grand Bargain” was struck. It was signed by the world’s major donors and aid providers, promising structural reform and committed to getting more money directly through to local and national organisations. But the deal has seen little change. The system remains dominated by a familiar group of UN agencies and international NGOs. Progress is at a glacial pace. A lot of criticism for the lack of change is aimed at the UN system – much of it justified. But NGOs need to look at themselves too. Many carry out life-saving work often in some of the world’s most challenging places. This spectrum of aid organisations has sometimes been called an ecosystem , drawing resilience from its diversity. However, the world is evolving – not always in good ways – and so must our response. Increasingly, poverty is concentrated in pockets of protracted crises and fragility – conflict causes 80% of humanitarian needs. The Democratic Republic of the Congo has more than 13 million people in need of aid. Syria has a similar number. Yemen, Iraq, South Sudan and Somalia are among the most unsafe places to be a human being – particularly if you are a woman or a child. More than two billion people live in the most insecure and fragile parts of the world. If we are to truly Leave No One Behind in delivering the sustainable development goals, these are the places we need to reach. To do this we must reform the aid ecosystem, which is out of balance. Humanitarian and development assistance is siloed, inefficient and expensive, falling short of achieving lasting impact at scale. There are often too many small to medium-sized NGOs that are too similar, competing with local and national organisations across too many geographies, rather than offering something different. It has long been recognised that local agencies, embedded in communities and with lower overhead costs, are best placed to deliver aid and programmes where they can. Part of the justification for funding international agencies has been that donors have found it hard to monitor the results of such organisations. But sophisticated evaluation mechanisms mean the reasons not to fund those agencies directly are diminishing. But such evaluation is harder to achieve in fragile contexts. There are also likely to remain programmes of a scale that it may not be possible for local organisations to implement. It is here that international NGOs have a vital role: enabling impact at a greater scale, addressing the root causes of crises related to long-held grievances, weak governance and inequitable economic growth, particularly where local capacity has been undermined – and generating opportunities to replicate successful approaches elsewhere. Crucially, NGOs need to be of sufficient size. Small to medium-sized agencies end up duplicating each other and competing for work if they lack resources to meet the operating costs of running complex programmes in volatile environments. We need to move towards a situation where fewer, bigger international NGOs have the scale and resources to enable positive change and deliver services in the most fragile environments; they should also be complementary to national capacity. Not only would this reduce competition between international and national organisations and free up more resources for the latter, it would make it easier for organisations to break away from unhelpful labels such as “humanitarian” and “development”. But donors will need to change too. Donors have increasingly tended to offer funding based on applications from consortiums. However, those consortiums, each comprised of NGOs with their own brands, logos, support functions and operating costs, are formed primarily to provide the best access to funding – not necessarily for reasons of efficiency or because they represent the best chance of achieving lasting impact. Donors should set out a “Grand Challenge” for NGOs. Mindful of power imbalances and with the objective of freeing up resources for grassroots groups, they should provide a fund to encourage consolidation in a more permanent, structural way. That would mean greater efficiency and effectiveness, enabling the direction of more resources towards innovation, longer-term funding and to local organisations. Consolidation would also drive a change of roles in the sector – getting international agencies out of the way of national organisations and creating NGOs that can deliver large, complex, catalytic programmes in the most fragile and volatile places, through a more efficient and coordinated overall aid architecture. It is clear that the current pace is too slow for the people living in crisis. Consolidation could kickstart that change. • You can follow Simon O’Connell on Twitter @sioconnell1",Global development; Aid; United Nations; Society; World news; UK news,Global development
2019-02-20T18:39:14Z,Much to fear from post-Brexit trade deals with ISDS mechanisms | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/20/much-to-fear-from-post-brexit-trade-deals-with-isds-mechanisms,"On Thursday in parliament, MPs will get their first chance to debate post-Brexit trade deals, including with the United States. There is every sign that these deals will contain controversial investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanisms, after trade secretary Liam Fox reaffirmed the government’s support two weeks ago. ISDS clauses in trade deals allow foreign investors to sue national governments for any measures that harm their profits. These cases take place in secretive private arbitration courts and can cost the taxpayer billions. Previous cases brought against governments using ISDS include a Swedish energy firm suing Germany for introducing policies to curb water pollution; US pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly suing Canada for trying to keep medicines affordable; and French multinational Veolia suing Egypt for increasing its national minimum wage. ISDS is a dangerous threat to human rights, health and the environment. It can make it difficult for governments to introduce policies on these issues, even when they have democratic support. This is particularly problematic for developing countries, which face a high proportion of cases, further depleting the resources they have available to implement the sustainable development goals. ISDS courts give international investors a legal system that neither ordinary people nor domestic businesses can access, with low levels of transparency, no appeals system and high costs. Brexit means that the UK is likely to adopt an independent trade policy for the first time in over 40 years. As charities, trade unions and faith groups representing civil society, we are campaigning against ISDS in current and future trade and investment agreements. Liam Fox should take seriously the concerns of civil society and set out a trade policy that puts people and planet before corporate interests.

2018-02-08T15:54:31Z,'Let us not wait for the government': Nigerian man leads cleanup in world's most polluted city,https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/feb/08/nigerian-cleanup-polluted-city-onitsha-chris-junior-anaekwe,"A Nigerian man living in one of the world’s most polluted cities has been hailed for “leading by example” and cleaning up his community in the face of government inaction. Chris Junior Anaekwe, 28, drew the applause of the internet for leading a group of local teenagers in tackling rubbish in their neighbourhood in Onitsha, a port city in southern Nigeria. “It is good to always lead by example, not by talking talking talking,” he wrote on Facebook. Onitsha has by far the largest urban area in Anambra state, and is a densely populated industrial and commercial hub. Anaekwe, a graduate of the University of Nigeria in Nsukka, told NPR in an interview published on Tuesday he had been “inspired to do something” after seeing the city’s intensely polluted market. He said he hoped the exercise had shown his neighbours they had some role to play in cleaning up the area. “I wanted the kids to be the ones to clean up. I believe it will go a long way to teach them a lesson: that they are the protectors of their own environment ... “We need to help ourselves. We must not wait for the government.” The challenge, however, is greater in Onitsha than it is in many places. The city recently gained notoriety for the staggering levels of PM10 particulate matter recorded in its air: an annual mean concentration of 594 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m). The World Health Organisation’s annual guideline is 20 μg/m. PM10s are small, coarse dust particles that penetrate deep into the lungs and the cardiovascular system, posing a great risk to human health. However, reporting on the air quality in Onitsha for Guardian Cities last year, journalist Hadassah Egbedi found that residents were either not aware of the health risks posed by their environment, or did not take them seriously. Some residents also believed that individuals’ efforts to clean up the environment were negated by local and state governments’ inaction. “It is the government’s responsibility to keep the city clean, not the work of the residents,” Ikechukwu Obizue, a businessman, told Egbedi. Anaekwe – who described himself to NPR as a self-appointed “ambassador” of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals for Nigeria – challenged this attitude in this call to action on Facebook in late January: “Health is wealth. Health is everything. “Onitsha people, it is [time] for us to say no to dirty environment for it poses great danger to our health. Let us not wait for the government to clean our gullies for us. It is us that is going to suffer [health] damages. “Cleanup is a must.” Anaekwe’s former colleague Chimezie Anajama‏ called attention to his good deed on Twitter, where it went viral. It then caught the attention of Malaka Gharib, the deputy editor of NPR’s global development blog, Goats and Soda, who interviewed Anaekwe as an example of “wonderful things happening if we just open our [eyes emoji]”. Anaekwe told her it took him two weeks to persuade the group of nearly a dozen boys, aged 14 to 16, to help him tackle the gutter filled with blackened rubbish. “At first, many people rejected the idea. They were like, ‘No, I can’t do this, hire someone to do it,’” he said. “But I told them: if you want to lead, you need to be the first to do it. So I led by example. As I started to clean up, they saw I was serious and they joined me.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here",Cities; Nigeria; Air pollution; Environment; World news; Africa; Pollution; Waste,Cities
2019-07-14T10:57:25Z,Will Mark Carney and George Osborne vie for the top IMF job?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/14/will-mark-carney-and-george-osborne-vie-for-the-top-imf-job,"Ever since he set his departure date from the Bank of England, there has been speculation about what Mark Carney will do next. There are not that many bigger jobs around than his current one but one of them has become available after the news of Christine Lagarde’s planned departure from the International Monetary Fund for the European Central Bank. Carney would certainly like a move to Washington, not least because the other job he has had his eye on – prime minister of Canada – is currently occupied by Justin Trudeau. Asked at a Bank press conference whether he is interested, Carney replied he had lots of admiration for Lagarde and that the proper processes should be followed. What he pointedly didn’t say was “no”. Carney is qualified to run the IMF. He ran Canada’s central bank before his arrival in Threadneedle Street in 2013. He has chaired the Financial Stability Board, the body set up by the G20 to oversee reforms of the global banking system after the near meltdown of 2008. He has been at the forefront of international moves to prepare the financial system for climate-related risks. Philip Hammond says that when Carney speaks at international meetings the other participants put down their smart phones and listen, a courtesy offered to only an elite few. But none of that might matter, because Carney is Canadian. That’s relevant because under a stitch-up that dates back to the creation of the post-war financial global organisations 75 years ago, a European runs the IMF and an American holds the reins at the World Bank. Carney holds British and Irish passports, and has some influential friends in Europe – Mario Draghi at the ECB for one – but will struggle to make the case that he is European rather than Canadian. It goes without saying that none of this should have any bearing on who succeeds Lagarde. The right way to appoint a new managing director of the IMF would be to decide what the organisation is actually for and then choose the most suitable person to run it, regardless of their place of birth or their nationality. For the Fund this means three three things: to return it to its original mission of helping countries out of balance of payments troubles without crippling them with austerity; to help countries meet the 2020 UN sustainable development goals; and to meet the challenge of global heating. Over the years, and particularly since countries such as China, India and Brazil have become important sources of growth, the US-Europe “gentleman’s agreement” has looked more and more of an anachronism. In 1980, global economic output was split 60-40% in favour of advanced western economies. Today, it is the other way round. But when the US citizen Jim Yong Kim unexpectedly resigned as president of the World Bank earlier this year, it came as absolutely no surprise that the Europeans left it to the White House to appoint a successor. After rubber-stamping David Malpass for the Bank, the Europeans will expect a quid pro quo from the US when it comes to the IMF. The process for filling the top jobs at both organisations is supposed to be open, transparent and merit-based, but the advanced nations continue to have a stranglehold on the Bretton Woods organisations. Despite the warm words, everybody knows that Lagarde’s successor will be a European. That’s why Carney wouldn’t have a prayer without a British or Irish passport, and it is why George Osborne, was quick to register an interest. Osborne would be a terrible choice for the IMF. He showed no interest in the organisation when he was chancellor other than to seek support in Washington for his austerity programme at home. But he knows how the process works. A successful candidate needs to get the backing of their own government and also be well thought of by other countries. The former chancellor will have done his prospects no harm by backing Boris Johnson to be prime minister and has reminded the Europeans that he was quick to back Lagarde when she became IMF’s managing director in 2011. Nor, given the European Commission’s obsession with budgetary orthodoxy, will austerity count necessarily against him. Even so, the portents for Carney or Osborne getting the IMF gig are not great. Britain has a poor track record when it comes to grabbing the top international jobs; there has never been a Briton heading the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development or the World Trade Organisation. As for the IMF, of the 11 managing directors, one has been a Belgian, one a Dutchman, one a German, one a Spaniard, and two have been Swedes. The remaining five have been French, including the last two. Emmanuel Macron will no doubt be telling fellow EU leaders that Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, has what it takes to replace Lagarde but they think it is time for another country to have a turn. In only 12 of the past 56 years has a French man or woman not run the IMF. The recent horse-trading for the top EU jobs resulted in Germany getting the presidency of the European commission and France getting the plum post at the ECB. Spain and Belgium got the other two jobs up for grabs, which meant there was nothing for eastern Europe. The signs are good, therefore, for Kristalina Georgieva. She is Bulgarian; she is a former vice president of the European commission; she is number two to Malpass at the World Bank and knows how the Bretton Woods institutions work. And she is good at her job. If it is to be a European, Georgieva ticks a lot of boxes.",Economics; International Monetary Fund (IMF); Mark Carney; George Osborne; Business; Politics; UK news; Christine Lagarde; European Central Bank; Justin Trudeau; Philip Hammond; Mario Draghi; World news,Business
2019-09-04T11:50:36Z,Global food producers 'failing to face up to role' in climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/04/global-food-producers-climate-crisis,"The world’s biggest producers of meat, dairy and seafood are failing to tackle the enormous impact they are having on the planet through deforestation, the routine use of antibiotics and greenhouse gas emissions, a report warns. The Coller Fairr index ranks 50 of the largest global meat, dairy and fish producers by looking at risk factors from use of antibiotics to deforestation and labour abuses. The producers are the “hidden” supply chain, providing meat and dairy to global brands including McDonald’s, Tesco, Nestlé and Walmart. The index is written by investment experts who want to encourage awareness of the risks posed to the planet – and to their own profitability – by companies that fail to mitigate the damage done to the environment by food production. Jeremy Coller is founder of Fairr and chief investment officer at Coller Capital. He says it is the huge companies behind the brands that will themselves suffer if the planet isn’t protected. “It is the companies hidden upstream in the meat and dairy supply chain who face the most significant climate and public health risks. “As last month’s landmark report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) demonstrated, the world’s meat, fish and dairy industries are under serious threat from climate change impacts. In stark contrast to the transport sector, only one in four meat, fish and dairy producers even measure their greenhouse gas emissions, let alone act to reduce them.” Among other failings, the index says that none of the companies analysed have a comprehensive policy to stop deforestation. And just four companies in the index “have committed to phasing out routine use of antibiotics, widespread in the industry”. According to the report, two-thirds of producers do not even measure all their greenhouse gas emissions let alone set targets to reduce them. These include Hormel Foods in the US, a supplier to McDonald’s. Also included is Cal-Maine Foods. Cal-Maine is the largest producer of fresh eggs in the US and a supplier to Walmart and Nestle. Nestlé, McDonald’s and Walmart have all publicly committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And while Walmart has previously said it wants to achieve zero net deforestation in its supply chain by 2020, the research shows that Walmart suppliers such as Cranswick in the UK have no comprehensive policy on deforestation. McDonald’s have pledged to reduce antibiotics use in their beef supply chains. But the vast majority of beef suppliers do not have a policy to avoid routine use of antibiotics. Only one – Marfrig – does. The companies are ranked according to their risk for investors, based on analysis of nine key environmental, social and governance risk factors, combined with the sustainable development goals. The Hong Kong-based WH Group were noted as “high risk” while Hormel Foods and Cranswick were designated as “medium risk”. The research argues that some of the companies, who between them have a value of $300bn (£248bn), are already suffering the costs of the deepening climate crisis. Cal-Maine Foods reported a 30% decline in revenues in the last quarter of the year alone due to extreme weather. Peter Van der Werf is an engagement specialist at investment firm Robeco, advising on how to invest sustainably. He told the Guardian that research into the environmental risks of food production is vital. “This is very important research. As investment managers we take a lot of care assessing risk – for example an analyst looking at food production needs to have a good understanding of climate change risks … like deforestation, loss of feed supply that comes through cattle grazing on depleted land, use of water.” Van der Werf says that he can see progress being made as producers are made aware of the benefit of considering environmental risks. “Companies were previously reluctant to show an interest in alternative proteins like fake meat, but we have seen a huge growth in demand. We started engagement over labour safety and use of antibiotics and over three years we have clearly seen an engagement and awareness. Now Tyson Foods, for example, has climate targets. They didn’t have that before.” He says the end aim is for producers and investors to move away from meat and fish as protein sources as much as possible. “The fires we have seen in the Amazon have come up in conversations with investors. They are concerned about climate change, about forest fires. There is a global need to further reduce reliance on meat and dairy and look at different protein choices.” A spokesman for the National Farmers’ Union told the Guardian that there is a commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions in the UK farming industry by 2040. He said this will be achieved through improving efficiency and animal welfare, managing carbon storage on farms and boosting renewable energy. The Guardian contacted the companies named but at the time of publication had not received responses from all of them. Nestle said: “The Nestlé Responsible Sourcing Standard sets out sustainability practices that we ask our suppliers, their employees, agents and subcontractors to respect and adhere to at all times. In addition, we run a responsible sourcing program for 15 high-priority raw materials, including meat, poultry and eggs and dairy. For these materials, our work starts by mapping our supply chain all the way down to the farm or slaughterhouse. When suppliers refuse to improve, we will remove them from our supply chain.” Walmart said: “We believe that both collaborative action and traceability across our global supply chain are needed to reduce deforestation associated with the production of beef and soy in Brazil. We’re working with the Consumer Goods Forum, the Tropical Forest Alliance and the Statement of Support Group for the Cerrado Manifesto as we work toward our goal to reduce deforestation.” A Tesco spokesperson said: “Food is at the heart of our business, and our commitment to sustainable sourcing is recognised by FAIRR both in this report and its recent ‘Appetite for disruption’ report, where Tesco topped the retail ranking for our focus on sustainable protein. We set ourselves ambitious and transparent sustainability targets, including across carbon reduction, biodiversity and tackling deforestation, which we will meet through working in partnership with our suppliers.” Tyson Foods said: “We recently announced a science-based target to decrease greenhouse gas emissions 30% by 2030 as well as a partnership with Environmental Defense Fund focused on increasing sustainable farming practices on more than 2m acres of row crop corn by 2020. This is the largest commitment ever made by a US protein company, and we will be reporting on our progress over time.” Hormel said: “As a global branded food company, we take our sustainability practices very seriously. We are working toward achieving our 2020 goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and non-renewable energy use by 10% by 2020. “We are pleased to see the report highlighted our company as one of the leaders in the industry and showcased Hormel Foods for our best practices for water usage. Additionally, the report singled out Hormel Foods as being the only company that has established a sustainable agricultural policy that extends to feed-grain growers.”",Environment; Meat industry; Farming; Food; Deforestation; Climate crisis; Conservation; Trees and forests,Environment
2019-08-08T05:00:12Z,Globalisation as we know it will not survive Trump. And that’s a good thing | Larry Elliott,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/08/globalisation-not-survive-trump-markets-new-world-order,"The significance of the trade war between China and the US goes well beyond the impact of tit-for-tat tariffs, or which of two self-styled strongmen wins the bragging rights. As was the case in the 1930s, the seemingly inexorable drift towards protectionism is part of a deeper crisis of the international status quo. When Beijing this week accused the US of “deliberately destroying the international order”, it was really saying that US hegemony will no longer go unchallenged. Globalisation as we have known it is coming to an end and that’s by no means unwelcome. Hailed as the ultimate in human progress, a model based on loosening the controls on capital and the construction of global supply chains has spawned recurrent financial crises, fostered corrosive inequality and worsened the climate emergency. True, millions of people have been lifted out of poverty in the past 25 years, but most of them live in a country – China – that has kept the market at arm’s-length. The world’s stock markets see things differently. They tremble every time Donald Trump tweets a paean to protectionism. Likewise, multinational corporations fret about the possible damage that trade barriers might cause to global supply chains. It is clear that those who have done best out of globalisation tend to be the rich and powerful, and they are not going to give up their privileges without a fight. Nothing in this is new. Throughout history there have been successive waves of globalisation followed by a backlash when the model over-reached itself. This is one of those occasions and all the ingredients are in place for a struggle between the defenders of the status quo and those who say that recent trends in politics, technology and the climate point to the need for a new world order focused more on local solutions, stronger nation states and a reformed international system. It’s quite a stretch to imagine that Trump has this in mind when he is bashing China, but the economic crisis of the 1930s – of which protectionism was one part – led eventually, albeit after the war, to reforms that made the world a sounder and safer place. The challenge is to make sure crisis again leads to change, and that process starts with an honest appraisal of the mess we are in. For more than a decade, ever since the financial crash of 2008, there has been a frantic attempt to put globalisation back on its feet and return to the status quo ante. Trump is proof that those attempts have ended in failure. In retrospect, the early 1990s marked globalisation’s high point. The Soviet Union had collapsed, former communist countries were becoming market economies, independent central banks were all the rage and a multilateral trade deal was concluded after more than seven years of negotiations. Europe’s integrationist project was in full swing, with preparations under way for a single currency. Politics during the 1990s was dominated by parties of the centre right and centre left, pursuing broadly similar economic policies: budgetary discipline, liberalising capital flows, encouraging the incursion of the market into sectors hitherto off limits. Whether in the developed countries of Europe or the emerging markets of Latin America, orthodoxy reined supreme. Sure, it was accepted that there were teething problems with the new world order, but the cold war was over and Russia no longer a threat. America would use its unchallenged military might to police the world and keep factories booming internationally through its willingness to act as the consumer of last resort. Little of this utopian vision has survived. There has not been a completed set of multilateral trade talks since the Uruguay round was wrapped up in late 1993, in large part because this was the last time the US and the EU were able to carve out a deal to their mutual interest and then impose it on the rest of the world. The G7 – the US, Canada, Japan and the four biggest economies of Europe – no longer call all the shots at international summits. The independence of central banks is threatened. The US is unwilling to soak up all the world’s excess production and instead demands that countries such as Germany run down their trade surpluses. Europe’s drive for integration has stalled. Parties of the centre have been hollowed out, either because they failed to spot the weaknesses inherent in globalisation or were too timid to act if they did. The Washington consensus – that there was a one-size-fits-all solution to the problems of developing countries that involved privatisation, abandoning capital controls and budgetary rectitude – has fallen into disrepute. And Russia is not the busted flush it was supposed to be. The risk that the current iteration of globalisation could end in military conflict is much higher than generally acknowledged. To prevent such an outcome, there needs to be change at all levels, starting with the local one. Even during its heyday, large chunks of economic activity remained untouched by globalisation and that segment is likely to grow as economies become more service-sector dominated. In addition, countries such as the US are already bringing production back within its borders – in part because of the high cost of transporting goods around the world, and in part because technological change – greater use of robots and artificial intelligence – has reduced the financial incentive to offshore. There is also going to be an enhanced role for the nation state, the death of which has been exaggerated. It will no longer be good enough for politicians to fob off voters with the idea that globalisation is an unstoppable force of nature against which they are powerless. Telling the public that inequality, industrial decay and stagnant living standards are something they have to suck up is asking for big populist trouble. China’s Belt and Road initiative is an example of how countries are starting to operate at a sub-global level. Beijing’s network of infrastructure projects across Asia and Europe has a dual purpose: to provide a market for Chinese goods and to extend Beijing’s reach in parts of the world where America’s hard and soft power is weak. Similarly, trade deals are likely to be negotiated bilaterally or among coalitions of the willing. Finally, there’s a need for reform at a global level: to mobilise effective climate-change action, to meet the United Nations’ sustainable development goals, to rein in the power of global finance through curbs on capital flows, and to piece together a system of rules-based, but managed, trade. None of this will be easy – in fact, it will be hellishly difficult. But three developments provide cause for optimism. The first is that the failings of the current system have become too big to ignore. The second is that failure has, as ever, led to new thinking. The third is that the new ideas are starting to influence policy. • Larry Elliott is the Guardian’s economics editor",Globalisation; Economics; China; International trade; Global economy; Donald Trump; US news; World news,Opinion
2019-06-03T04:00:51Z,Not one single country set to achieve gender equality by 2030,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jun/03/not-one-single-country-set-to-achieve-gender-equality-by-2030,"No country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality by 2030, according to the first index to measure progress against a set of internationally agreed targets. Melinda Gates, co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, said the index, launched on Monday, “should serve as a wake-up call to the world”. Even the Nordic states, which score highly in the index, would need to take huge strides to fulfil gender commitments in the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs), which 193 countries signed up to in 2015. The goals are considered the blueprint for global efforts to end poverty and inequality and halt the climate crisis. The deadline to meet them is 2030. The inaugural SDG Gender Index, developed by the Equal Measures 2030 partnership, found that 2.8 billion women and girls currently live in countries that are not doing enough to improve women’s lives. The index measured progress in 129 countries, marking them from zero to 100 – 100 meaning equality has been achieved – on 51 targets in 14 of the goals. These targets either specifically reference gender equality, or touch on issues that have a disproportionate affect on women and girls, such as whether women have access to mobile banking, or the internet, or a safe water source. According to the index, countries with an overall score of 90 or more are making excellent progress, while those scoring 59 or less are making very poor headway on achieving the goals. The average overall score for the 129 countries in the index – home to 95% of the world’s women and girls – was 65.7, considered a poor result in the scoring system. Women’s underrepresentation in parliament, the gender pay gap and gender-based violence were among the areas all countries were struggling to tackle. Only 21 countries achieved marks of 80 or above, with the top country, Denmark, achieving 89.3. The UK, came 17th with a score of 82.2. Twenty-one countries scored lower than 50, with Chad at the foot of the table with a mark of 33.4. Of particular concern for those involved in compiling the index was that more than half of countries scored poorly on efforts to achieve SDG 5, the much lobbied-for standalone goal to end gender inequality and empower women. The goal contains specific targets to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, end female genital mutilation and child marriage, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare, and uphold women’s reproductive rights. Alison Holder, director of Equal Measures 2030, said: “I don’t see any countries taking the ambitious action needed to tackle intractable problems – even the best scoring countries. “I don’t see how naturally these problems will go away. Even among the best scoring countries there are still massive problems.” As well as concerns over slow progress, Holder said she feared achievements could be undone, given the current rollback of abortion laws in the US and challenges to commitments to women’s rights at the United Nations. The US ranked 28th in the index with a score of 77.6 points. “It’s clear that even in countries at the top of the index that progress is never guaranteed,” said Holder. “We need to guard against countries falling backwards.” Memory Kachambwa, executive director of the African Women’s Development and Communication Network (Femnet), said what is happening in the US, and the power the Trump administration has to influence key language in international agreements, set a worrying precedent. “It’s worrying at an international level because it gives a foothold to other governments to continue to repress women,” she said. “Parties who are very much against women’s rights and gender equality are growing stronger and stronger and are able to have lot of influence in policy spaces a global level.” Although disappointed with the pace of change, she added that the index did at least offer a clearer picture on how countries were doing. “When we talk to policymakers, they say they want the evidence [of gender inequalities]. We now have the evidence,” she said. Europe and North American countries topped the index, while the bottom was dominated by African states. But the index noted that all countries had “different starting points” and, on some targets, states with low GDP were making better progress than wealthier nations in. Denmark, for example, ranks behind Georgia, Kazakhstan and Lithuania on education, partly because the country has a lower percentage of young women who have completed secondary school. It also has fewer women MPs than Senegal and Rwanda, despite the Nordic state having a GDP per capita 56 times higher than Senegal. The bottom 20 countries scored higher than the top 20 for breaking down their budgets by factors such as gender, age, income or region. Women are more likely to have their needs for family planning met in Brazil, China and Nicaragua, than in Canada, the Netherlands and Norway. The index, launched at the Women Deliver conference in Vancouver, will be updated in 2021 and at regular internals until the 2030 SDG deadline. Data are drawn from UN agencies, the World Bank, NGOs, thinktanks and from the consultancy firm Gallup. Equal Measures 2030 is a partnership of civil society and the private sector, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the International Women’s Health Coalition, KPMG, Femnet, Plan International and Women Deliver. It was set up in 2016 to provide women’s rights advocates with the data they need to hold governments to account for their SDG commitments.",Women's rights and gender equality; Global development; World news; Gender; Women; Life and style,Global development
2018-09-21T10:19:18Z,Global push to cut deaths from cancer and heart disease wildly off course,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/sep/21/global-push-to-cut-deaths-from-cancer-heart-disease-wildly-off-course-lancet-un-non-communicable,"More than half of all countries will not meet global targets to cut deaths from cancer, heart disease and other chronic conditions, according to a report in the Lancet. In 2015, world leaders pledged to cut deaths from chronic disease among 30- to 70-year-olds by a third as part of the sustainable development goals. However, the latest figures show that progress on tackling the issue has so far has been too slow to meet the 2030 deadline for achieving the target. The Lancet research shows that death rates in one in 10 countries have either stood still or got worse. In the US, for example, death rates among women have stagnated, with almost one in eight (12.5%) dying from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) between the ages of 30 and 70. Conversely, in South Korea, the best performing country, the rate for women is one in 20. In the UK in 2016, women aged 30 had a 9% chance of dying from one of the four major non-communicable diseases – cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory diseases and diabetes – before their 70th birthday, while men had a 13% chance. Countries where sustainable development target 3.4 is likely to be achieved for both men and women include South Korea, Czech Republic, Denmark, Kazakhstan, Timor-Leste and New Zealand. Broadening the scope of the research to include people up to the age of 80 offers an even bleaker picture, with only 17 countries (9%) on track to meet the target for women, and five countries (3%) for men. In 2016, 27.3 million people under the age of 80 died from chronic disease. The study, entitled NCD countdown 2030 and published ahead of a high-level UN meeting on the subject in New York next week, found that although mortality due to chronic disease is going down, the rate of decline varies significantly, even among countries in the same region. The authors, who believe this may be due to a lack of improvement in risk factors such as smoking, alcohol and obesity, have called on policymakers to act. The measures they have suggested include the introduction of restrictions, taxation and advertising bans to reduce the use of alcohol and tobacco. They also called for earlier diagnosis and treatment of chronic disease. “Despite clear commitments, international aid agencies and national governments are doing too little to reduce deaths from cancers, heart and lung diseases and diabetes. Progress is even slower for other diseases, and diabetes, which are not a part of the sustainable development goals target, meaning that the true health of people in most countries is even more dire,” said Professor Majid Ezzati of Imperial College London, the report’s lead author. “The NCD Countdown 2030 is a shot in the arm for the global response to the NCD epidemic, which has long needed a stronger accountability process,” said Katie Dain, CEO (London) of the NCD Alliance. “The aspirations and promises of commitments from political leaders made at the meeting are now on notice. Even those governments who appear to be on track cannot be complacent – they must remain vigilant and respond with effective policies to emerging threats to the health of the next generation, including child obesity, air pollution and the ever evolving tactics of the tobacco and alcohol industries.” Writing in an editorial, the Lancet’s editor, Dr Richard Horton, said: “Calls for strengthened NCD accountability have been made for at least a decade. Many obstructions have blocked progress. The promises made by the international community must be delivered.”",Global health; Sustainable development goals; Global development; Health; Cancer; Heart disease; Society; World news; Need For Speed; Environmental sustainability,Global development
2019-02-09T09:00:08Z,"Congo's election: a defeat for democracy, a disaster for the people",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/feb/09/democratic-republic-of-the-congo-election-a-defeat-for-democracy-disaster-for-people-mo-ibrahim,"The major players in the international community have accepted the outcome of January’s elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in the name of stability. In doing so, they have failed the Congolese people. Moreover, they have fallen short of the aspirations of the UN’s sustainable development goals, which call for “accountable and inclusive institutions”. The results compiled by the independent national election commission (CENI), leaked to the press, confirm those of the Catholic church, which fielded 40,000 observers across the country. They show that Martin Fayulu, the opposition coalition candidate, won the presidential election, not by a whisker, but by a landslide. However, after a week’s delay and intense negotiations, the CENI announced the victory of Felix Tshisekedi. This is a defeat for democracy. Both in the region and beyond, many argue that, whatever its flaws, the election at least produced a transition from the long presidency of Joseph Kabila, which is the best bet to preserve stability in DRC and the wider Great Lakes region. They may well be wrong on both counts. First, while Kabila has officially stepped down from office, he and his associates will most likely continue controlling the levers of power. His political coalition, having won an overwhelming (and improbable) majority of seats in the parliamentary elections, will ultimately determine the choice of prime minister, who will in turn manage the government’s key ministries and security agencies. Second, though Tshisekedi’s election may have staved off major unrest in Kinshasa in the short-term, the new government will lack genuine legitimacy and risks repeated challenges to its authority. Without that legitimacy, the government will find it hard to undertake the many serious reforms that DRC so urgently requires. Kofi Annan often cautioned that legality does not necessarily confer legitimacy. Time and again we have seen leaders installed in office by legal manoeuvres that fail to confer the legitimacy required for effective leadership, especially in times of crisis. The international community should be mindful of that point as it considers how to respond to the post–electoral crisis that has erupted in DRC. Most worryingly, however, having seen that elections lack the power to change things, the Congolese people may turn to other methods to overturn the unbearable status quo, in which the vast majority of the population wallows in poverty while those at the summit of the state amass fortunes. Already there are calls to arms emerging from the east, which has a history of insurgency. There are dozens of armed groups active that could be harnessed to this cause. Many of the DRC’s neighbours will be affected if another round of widespread violence erupts. The international community has invested many billions of dollars in DRC over the past two decades to try to stabilise the country and the region, and to steer the republic towards a democratic, just and prosperous future. By passively accepting this fait accompli, all that investment will have been compromised. That is why we call on the Southern African Development Community, the African Union, the EU and the UN, in particular, not to abandon the democratic aspirations of the Congolese people who voted overwhelmingly for change. It is not too late to insist on the publication of CENI’s detailed results for both the presidential and parliamentary elections. In the meantime, they must maintain all existing sanctions and suspend any further extension of cooperation with the DRC government until a credible transition emerges. • Mo Ibrahim is founder and chair of the Mo Ibrahim Foundation.

2019-04-10T15:18:56Z,Poorest countries bear the brunt as aid levels fall for second successive year,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/apr/10/poorest-countries-bear-the-brunt-as-aid-levels-fall-for-second-successive-year,"Experts have warned that the fight against global poverty has taken a backward step after the publication of new figures showing foreign aid has fallen for a second successive year. Aid levels dropped last year by 2.7% from 2017, with the poorest countries worst hit, according to figures published by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Bilateral aid – direct, country-to-country assistance – to the least developed countries fell by 3% in 2018, with support to the African continent down 4% and humanitarian assistance dropping by 8%. Money from donors, the private sector and foundations, defined by the OECD as external finance, accounts for more than two-thirds of the funding for the world’s least developed countries and so offers a crucial lifeline. Toni Pearce, Oxfam’s head of advocacy, said: “The overall fall in aid globally is a worrying trend that risks exacerbating poverty and inequality worldwide. Cutting aid to the poorest and most vulnerable countries is a step backwards in the fight to end extreme poverty. “With refugee numbers at their highest since the second world war, disasters like Cyclone Idai devastating lives, and food crises looming in Yemen and elsewhere, the fall in humanitarian aid is particularly alarming. Vulnerable people across the world rely on this essential lifeline when disaster hits.” Angel Gurría, the OECD secretary general, also expressed concern: “This picture of stagnating public aid is particularly worrying as it follows data showing that private development flows are also declining. Donor countries are not living up to their 2015 pledge to ramp up development finance, and this bodes badly for us being able to achieve the 2030 sustainable development goals.” Only five of the 30 development assistance committee (DAC) members met or exceeded the longstanding aid target of 0.7% of gross national income target: Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden and the UK. Contributions from donors not currently members of the DAC group were also noted, but not counted within these figures. Turkey and the UAE donated 1.10% and 0.95% of their gross national income. This year’s numbers reflect new rules and methodology. Funds spent on processing and hosting refugees no longer count as official development assistance, or ODA, beyond the first year after their arrival. The altered practice has been criticised by groups like Concord, the European confederation of relief and development NGOs, which produces an annual AidWatch report. Aid flows fell in a dozen countries, partly due to fewer refugees arriving. Austria, Finland, Greece, Italy, Japan and Portugal reported the biggest drops. The figures were previously calculated on a cash flow basis that permitted donors to report loans for their full amount. Only the grant portion of loans will now count. Susanna Moorehead, the DAC chair, said the revised rules have created “a more accurate and transparent way of measuring donor effort”. The new rules do not currently apply to donor subsidies to the private sector. Jan Van de Poel, policy and advocacy manager on aid effectiveness at the European Network on Debt and Development, urged donor countries to agree on robust rules for the private sector to avoid incentivising these subsidies over other types of aid, like grants, which often reap more sustainable results for the poorest and most vulnerable. Van de Poel said: “Rich countries increasingly use development aid to support the private sector through contentious private sector instruments. Investments through these instruments often prioritise commercial objectives in middle-income countries, leaving behind low-income countries and public service sectors which are not easily turned into profit-making business, like education or healthcare in remote rural areas”. Claire Godfrey, head of policy and campaigns for Bond, the UK network for NGOs, said: “It’s a travesty that in 2019, so many world leaders are turning their backs on the people stuck at the bottom, leaving them without a way to even escape poverty. Thankfully, the UK isn’t one of those countries, but today’s message is clear – poverty, inequality, climate change and injustice are all set to increase globally unless other political leaders step up to the plate and deliver poverty-focused official development assistance.” Sara Harcourt, director of development finance policy for the One campaign, said: “Now is the time we should be stepping up, not walking away. We will be watching to see what leaders do at the G7 Summit and the Global Fund replenishment later this year. A first step to righting this course is for leaders to make bold pledges at these meetings.”",Aid; Global development; Africa; World news; Society; Sustainable development goals,Global development
2019-02-20T12:59:52Z,Glencore to limit coal production after pressure from investors,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/20/glencore-to-limit-coal-production-after-pressure-from-investors-church-of-england,"The commodities trader Glencore has bowed to pressure from shareholders to limit coal production for environmental reasons – days after reporting that it produced nearly 130m tonnes of the fossil fuel last year. The Switzerland-based firm, whose oil-trading operation is based in London, laid out plans to improve its environmental record, including a review of its membership of trade bodies it fears may be undermining the international Paris climate agreement. Glencore, which is Australia’s biggest miner of coal, said it was responding to concern within the investment community. The Church of England, which is understood to have a stake worth just under £10m in the group, welcomed the announcement. Carlota Garcia-Manas of the Church Commissioners, the C of E’s £8.3bn endowment fund, said: “The simple truth is that in the absence of commercially viable carbon capture and storage, coal has no long-term future in the energy mix. “Glencore’s commitments on capital investment and expenditure start to provide assurance to investors increasingly focused on climate-related risks and opportunities.” Major Australian superannuation funds with billions of dollars under management including AustralianSuper and Cbus also put pressure on Glencore. Jeanne Martin, senior campaigns officer at ShareAction, said it was “a good step forward for Glencore – the black sheep of the energy world – which for far too long refused to come out in support of the Paris agreement”. However, she added: “It’s actions, not words, that matter. Glencore’s south-east Asian coal frenzy will be a true test of the company’s commitment to the Paris goals. ShareAction will watch closely to make sure Glencore stays faithful to today’s commitments.” In a statement to the stock market, Glencore promised to prioritise investment in commodities that assist with the transition to cleaner energy and transport instead, while limiting coal at current production levels. An annual production report issued earlier this month showed that Glencore extracted 129.4m tonnes of coal in 2018, a 7% increase on the previous year. “We recognise climate change science as set out by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),” the FTSE 100 company said. “We believe that the global response to climate change should pursue twin objectives: both limiting temperatures in line with the goals of the Paris agreement and supporting the United Nations sustainable development goals, including universal access to affordable energy.” Glencore set out a plan that it said would help support the transition to a low-carbon world. The first tranche of the plan, starting in 2020, will mean the company publishing projections illustrating how it will reduce its emissions and set out how its strategy governing fossil fuel exploration and investment is affecting its efforts on climate. It also claimed to be on track to meet a target of reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of its own operations by 5% by 2020 and promised to publish more stretching long-term targets next year. The plan could also result in climate change objectives being attached to executive pay schemes, while the company will review its membership in trade associations whose lobbying might “undermine” climate change goals. The pledge on climate change came as Glencore undershot profit forecasts for the year, reporting earnings down 41% to $3.41bn (£2.6bn), largely because of impairment costs at mines in DR Congo and Zambia. The company also offered to buy back $2bn of shares from investors. Last year it launched a $1bn buyback only days after revealing it was subject to an investigation by the US Department of Justice, an announcement that sent its shares tumbling. Investigators leading Brazil’s vast Car Wash investigation have also named Glencore among firms they allege are linked to bribes.",Glencore; Coal; Business; Commodities; Energy; Environment; Fossil fuels; UK news; Switzerland; Anglicanism; World news,Business
2018-09-18T04:01:14Z,Bill Gates: 'Trump could be persuaded' on US foreign aid spending,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/18/bill-gates-trump-united-states-foreign-aid-spending,"Donald Trump is “open-minded” about policies and might be persuaded on foreign aid, Bill Gates has said in an exclusive interview with the Guardian. The billionaire philanthropist said President Trump does not have a fixed ideology in most areas and is open to new ideas, “particularly if it’s doing things in a different way than was done before”. He added that Trump had already been influenced by arguments put forward by US defence secretary Jim Mattis, who emphasised the importance of soft power. Gates was speaking ahead of Tuesday’s launch of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation’s annual Goalkeepers report, which warns that decades of progress in the fight against poverty and disease is at risk of stalling. The report, which analysed progress made towards the UN’s sustainable development goals, said populations were growing fastest in the poorest parts of the world. Africa’s birthrate could prove an asset, but only if the world invested in the continent’s young people, it said. “If current trends continue, the number of poor people in the world will stop falling – and could even start to rise,” the report said. Gates warned that the west should not ignore Africa. Its stability makes “a huge difference to the entire world”, he told the Guardian. “A pandemic like Ebola can spread very fast,” he said, while other diseases spread even faster without local health services. Syria is a small country, he said, yet its civil war exodus has “challenged the asylum system”. He added: “Africa is another order of magnitude.” Gates has repeatedly argued against cuts to the US aid budget. Last year Trump stopped funding family-planning organisations that also offer abortions, stalling access to contraception where women need it most. But Gates said he believed Trump was open to persuasion about the value of foreign aid. “One of the things you can say, a plus or minus, is that in very few areas does he have a fixed ideology. If there’s something where he feels he can look smart … particularly if it’s doing things in a different way than was done before, then yes, I think he’s open-minded.” Gates added: “We have to work with Trump himself and the whole administration on ‘What is your vision for Africa?’ And as a human being who cares about human beings, as a country who doesn’t want to go fight foreign wars or deal with pandemics that are out of control …” The president had been influenced by arguments put forward by Mattis that soft power – state department diplomacy and aid – prevented the need for hard power, Gates added. Mattis had previously warned: “If you don’t fully fund the state department then I need to buy more ammunition.” Gates said dramatic progress has been made in fighting poverty and disease. Since 2000 more than a billion people had come out of extreme poverty, defined as living on $1.90 (£1.45) or less a day. The UK, which meets the UN’s aid target of 0.7% of national income, has contributed towards this success, he said. “The UK has been very generous to the vaccine fund, for two miraculous vaccines, one for pneumonia, one for diarrhoea.” Both are now preventable at extremely low cost. “The UK led that effort and saved over 10 million lives,” said Gates. People should know this message of hope, Gates said, adding that there had been a failure to convey such success stories. “We’re talking about uplifting the human condition in a fairly dramatic way,” he said. The Goalkeepers report, which tracks progress towards the 17 sustainable development goals, in areas such as HIV prevention and education, found improvements in most areas. But there is a marked variation in the future trajectory, and the report warned that progress depends on future investment.",World news; Global health; Poverty; Bill Gates; Donald Trump; US news,World news
2019-04-10T21:00:09Z,Nottingham Trent wins inaugural Guardian university of the year award,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/apr/10/nottingham-trent-wins-inaugural-guardian-university-of-the-year-award,"Nottingham Trent University has been crowned university of the year in the Guardian’s annual awards for its inclusive curriculum and focus on social mobility. The award, which was introduced this year, is calculated on the basis of several measures, including performance and improvement in the Guardian league tables. These focus on the university activities that matter most to young people: quality of teaching, student satisfaction and employability. Last year, Nottingham Trent overtook its elite Russell Group rival, Nottingham University, in the Guardian’s university league tables for the first time. The former polytechnic, which has 30,000 students across four campuses in the city and surrounding countryside, was among the highest risers in the rankings. The Guardian award factors in how good universities are at retaining students who come from areas of low participation in higher education, and whether their black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) students do as well as their white peers. Bonus points are awarded for race charter awards; Athena Swan awards, which reflect gender balance; and Stonewall’s ranking of good practice on LGBT issues. Prof Edward Peck, vice-chancellor of Nottingham Trent University, said social mobility is a priority since a quarter of the student body is from households with a combined income of £15,000 or less. The university was the first to sign up to the government’s new social mobility pledge, which commits it to working with schools and employers to improve life chances for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. “We’ve been very determined to reduce some of the attainment gaps for some of our students, and in particular to narrow the gaps between those who get graduate level jobs and those who don’t,” Peck said. As part of this drive, the university monitors academic progress closely using a state-of-the-art learning analytics system, which measures how often students use the library or log into the virtual learning environment. The university has also made work experience mandatory for all degree courses, and has updated all its courses to ensure they lead clearly towards a career. The update formed part of a wider 18-month process of curriculum overhaul across the university. This started with staff driving a double-decker bus around campus, to which academics were invited on board to discuss how they could modernise their curriculums to improve employability, diversify reading lists beyond white European thinkers, and reflect the UN’s sustainable development goals. “It brought the whole process to life,” said Eunice Simmons, deputy vice-chancellor. “It’s made a big difference in a lot of our courses.” Diversity is another priority for Nottingham Trent given that one third of its student body is BAME, and the university is working hard to reduce the disparity in grades with white students. One of the innovations which has enabled this is a team-based learning project called Scale-Up, which won the Guardian award for course and curriculum design. The project was rolled out among 16,000 students, and the university’s initial findings show that the approach has narrowed the gap between how well white and BAME students do by 4.2 percentage points. The university sees itself as a “social enterprise” with a focus on working with the local community, according to Peck. Lots of projects are targeted at disadvantaged residents given that the city ranks among the poorest in the UK. The university runs the award-winning Safer Living Foundation, a rehabilitation project for sexual offenders which is underpinned by the university’s research, and a legal advice centre, through which students have helped local residents claim £3m worth of benefits they had been denied. “It was a need in the city. It speaks to social inclusion, it develops student skills and experience, but it actually makes a real difference to people’s lives,” Peck said.

2019-03-22T14:04:14Z,Diarrhoea kills more children in war zones than war itself – Unicef,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/22/diarrhoea-kills-more-children-in-war-zones-than-war-itself-unicef,"Diarrhoea and other diseases related to poor sanitation are bigger killers of children in areas of conflict than violence and war itself, a report has found, highlighting the need for improved infrastructure as a way of helping civilian populations afflicted by warfare. Children under five are more than 20 times more likely to die from diarrhoeal diseases than from direct violence, according to Unicef. Henrietta Fore, the organisation’s executive director, said: “The reality is there are more children who die from lack of access to safe water than by bullets.” Women and children, who tend to be responsible for fetching water, are often unable to reach clean water sources in situations of conflict, while sometimes armed forces deliberately target water supplies and sanitation as weapons of war. Forces can also cut off the power that keeps vital infrastructure such as water pumps working, and conflict prevents maintenance personnel from making repairs. War also makes it harder for supplies of products needed to purify water or used in sanitation, such as chlorine and other cleaners, to get through to where they are needed. These factors add up to often neglected disasters that accompany protracted conflicts, with children bearing the brunt, according to a Unicef report, Water Under Fire, published on Friday to coincide with World Water Day. The report examined in detail 16 countries undergoing long civil wars and other conflicts. Fore called for an end to the deliberate targeting of water infrastructure, including attacks by governments, and for the international community to prioritise water and sanitation in its response to conflicts. “The odds are already stacked against children living through prolonged conflicts, with many unable to reach a safe water source,” she said. “Deliberate attacks on water and sanitation are attacks on vulnerable children. Water is a basic right. It is a necessity for life.” The report drew on countries including Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Children aged up to 15 were found to be more likely to die from water-related diseases than as a result of direct violence in all the countries studied except for Libya, Iraq and Syria. Megan Wilson-Jones, a senior policy analyst for health and hygiene at the charity WaterAid, said: “The findings of the report are tragic. Diarrhoea caused by dirty water and a lack of sanitation contributes to the death of a child under five every two minutes. “Ensuring good water, sanitation and hygiene is essential to the health of children in every setting, including as part of humanitarian emergency responses.” At least 4 billion people live in water-scarce areas, where for at least part of the year demand outstrips supply, and 844 million lack access to safe water close to home. Water scarcity is no longer just a problem for developing countries, as climate change, population increases, water wastage and increasing demand from agriculture and industry mean water supplies in large areas of the developed world are also coming under pressure. Earlier this week, the head of the UK’s environment agency warned England would face “the jaws of death”, running out of water within 25 years if nothing were done to halt demand growth and waste. Unicef’s findings came as a separate report, also focused on World Water Day, showed international businesses are continuing to drain global water supplies, even as they acknowledge the risks and potential negative impacts of doing so. CDP, an organisation focusing on measuring companies’ environmental impacts, looked at some of the world’s 300 biggest publicly listed companies and found roughly one-third are using more water than three years ago. Cate Lamb, the director of water security at CDP, said more companies must show leadership if the world is not to face a worsening problem. “The world is not on track to meet our global water goal [under the UN’s sustainable development goals] of ensuring access to sustainable water and sanitation for all,” she said. “The companies reporting to CDP are responsible for a huge proportion of global water use and pollution. While many of their practices and procedures currently contribute to the depletion of freshwater resources, these companies could also hold the key to a water-secure future.” WaterAid also pointed to the indirect use of water, which many people are unaware of, as key to solving the world’s water and sanitation crises. Although 4 billion people globally live in water-scarce areas, a number expected to rise to 5 billion by the middle of this century, many of these regions effectively export water in the form of agricultural goods from avocados to cotton. High consumption of these goods in buyer countries can lead to worsening problems for people in the exporting countries.",Water; Sanitation; Environment; World news; Afghanistan; Democratic Republic of the Congo; Mali; Somalia; Sudan; Syria; Yemen; Global development; United Nations; Access to water,Environment
2019-03-11T18:15:29Z,Gas strategy in the UK is wrongheaded | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/11/gas-strategy-in-the-uk-is-wrongheaded,"It is no surprise that the government’s strategy on fracking has been deemed unlawful (Fracking guidance illegally ignores climate change, 7 March). Gas may be more fuel efficient than coal when burnt, but shale gas is 95% methane, and methane is a powerful greenhouse gas. According to the IPCC it has a global warming potential (GWP) 85 times greater than carbon dioxide over a 20-year timeframe. Misleadingly, HMG have relied on an obsolete figure of 36 for the GWP of methane, dating back to 2013. Methane levels plateaued in the late 1990s, but have started to increase again over the past decade and have now reached 1,900 parts per billion, against a pre-industrial level of 700. Fracking is the obvious culprit. Satellite data over the US has shown that methane leakage exceeds 5% of shale gas production, an observation that fits with more recent studies by Nasa showing that fossil fuels are the major contributor to the continuing rise in atmospheric methane. Despite this evidence, the government’s energy strategy is to forge ahead with fracking while reducing environmental safeguards and providing tax incentives for its development. The government claim that gas is better than coal from a climate change perspective is only sustainable if fugitive emissions of methane are ignored. Let us hope that the high court judgment means that fracking will be abandoned in the UK as it has been elsewhere in Europe. Dr Robin Russell-Jones Scientific adviser to the all-party parliamentary group on air pollution (APPG) Geraint Davies MP Chair, APPG • Although I agree that climate change needs to be tackled, it is too simplistic for the Committee on Climate Change to suggest not connecting all new-build schemes to the gas grid from 2025 (Call for ban on gas hobs and boilers in new homes by 2025, 21 February). If the committee gets its way and all new builds are off-gas, then electricity for solutions such as heat pumps still needs to come from somewhere. Unless the electricity comes from a zero-carbon source, it defeats the object. If the whole of the country came off gas, we would need the power of about 30 nuclear power stations, and currently we have eight! Also, if we do switch to hydrogen gas then these homes without a gas connection could not be connected in the future and would miss the other benefits that hydrogen gas could deliver such as carbon-free cooking. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has already acknowledged that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to the decarbonisation of heating. Instead, different solutions should be working together. A hybrid system that uses a heat pump up to a certain temperature, which is then supported by a gas boiler, would be very effective not only in new build but many existing homes as well. Carbon emissions will be even lower if the gas boiler is run on hydrogen gas. Instead of advocating for unreasonable promises from government, the CCC should be supporting the research that is already under way into new “no carbon fuels”. I’d even like to extend an invitation to the CCC’s chief executive, Chris Stark, to a prototype demonstration we have planned later in the year, where we will show how a 100% hydrogen boiler will run. Carl Arntzen CEO, Worcester Bosch Group; chairman, the Domestic Heat Strategy Group • Our unsustainable lifestyles and commitment to perpetual economic growth have become the major drivers of climate change. Jason Hickel suggests that the solution is “about changing the way our economy operates” (Climate breakdown is coming. The UK needs a Greener New Deal, theguardian.com, 5 March). Encouragingly, the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) form a new roadmap for our future that in principle aligns the economy with the Earth’s life support systems. Yet a recent report by the Stockholm Resilience Centre[1] shows that attempting to achieve the socio-economic goals using conventional growth policies would make it virtually impossible to reduce the speed of global warming and environmental degradation. The research team tested three other scenarios and the only one that met all goals was the one that implemented systemic transformational change. A key element in the model was reducing inequality by a redistribution of wealth, work and income, including ensuring that the 10% richest people take no more that 40% of the income. We have an unprecedented and immense challenge before us – with little choice but to engage.

2019-02-24T13:02:18Z,UK must stop investing in fossil fuels in developing countries | Ban Ki-moon,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/24/ban-ki-moon-uk-must-stop-investing-in-fossil-fuels-in-developing-countries,"The United Kingdom is a critically important actor in the global fight against climate change. As a permanent member of the UN security council, and a member of the G20 group of leading industrialised economies, it is well placed to further a progressive climate agenda and influence other states to fully implement commitments made under the Paris agreement. Decarbonisation is a vital part of this agenda. The UK has made important progress in this regard; in April 2017, it enjoyed its first full day without any coal-fired electricity since the 1880s, which was a striking achievement for a country that had been at the vanguard of the Industrial Revolution. As the prime minister, Theresa May, said last year: “We can be proud of our success in facing up to the reality of climate change, but we are not complacent about the action needed to sustain that success in the future.” The best way for any country to avoid climate complacency is to develop robust, holistic and people-centred policies across government, so short-term trade or financial priorities do not trump the wider imperative of cutting global emissions. The UK now faces a crucial opportunity to live up to the prime minister’s words and prove it is serious about phasing out the use of fossil fuels worldwide, and not only on its own territory. The UK parliament’s environmental audit committee is currently holding an inquiry into UK Export Finance’s (UKEF) financing of fossil fuels in developing countries. This government agency provides financial support for international trade with the aim of boosting British companies’ exports. It is deeply concerning to note that over the period 2010-2014, UKEF provided more than 99.4% of its energy finance to fossil fuels, and less than 1% to renewable energy. Over the longer timeframe of 2010-16, it is estimated that UKEF provided £4.8bn of support for fossil fuel projects. The UK’s total spend on its International Climate Fund for a similar period, 2011-17, was £4.9bn. These figures and policies are hard to reconcile with the UK’s commitments under the Paris agreement, its membership of the Powering Past Coal Alliance and its own pledge in 2013 to end support for public financing of new coal-fired power plants overseas. They are also at odds with the view of the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, who warned in 2014 of the stranded asset risk inherent in fossil fuel projects. The time has come for the UK to change course, in the interests of the whole world. Research indicates that a third of oil reserves, half of gas reserves and over 80% of current coal reserves need to remain in the ground in order to meet the target of 2C of global warming. But as the recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change set out so starkly, our target must be 1.5C if we want to avert irreparable damage to our planetary ecosystem – so even more radical action against fossil fuels is required. Meeting these challenges can only be done collectively, in a spirit of international and intergenerational solidarity under the framework of the United Nations. I was UN secretary general when the Paris agreement was signed, and the sustainable development goals agreed. I valued the UK’s contributions and commitment to both these vital multilateral achievements, and continue to believe the country can play a transformative role in shaping the global climate agenda. As deputy chair of the Elders I continue to call on G20 nations to move away from fossil fuel investment, and I believe the UK can play a leading role in this crucial move. I encourage the UK government to recalibrate its export finance policy so it is fully consistent with international climate trends and obligations. Promoting fossil fuel investments abroad locks in high-carbon infrastructure in developing countries for years to come, which is the opposite of sustainable development. There is now a growing consensus that fossil fuels should not be funded in any way by export finance organisations. The World Bank Group has already ended its finance to upstream oil and gas; the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development recently ended finance to coal; and the Swedish Export Credit Corporation has announced it is going fully fossil-free. UKEF and the wider UK government should use the occasion of the parliamentary inquiry to demonstrate a clear shift in policy away from fossil fuels and use its investments to support clean energy. If the UK takes these necessary steps, it can be at the forefront of the transition to a low-carbon economy. I look forward to seeing its government, industries and people rising to this challenge.",Ban Ki-moon; Fossil fuels; Environment; Energy; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),World news
2019-05-23T06:00:37Z,'Hygiene is the first priority': Nepal looks to clean up its act on sepsis,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/may/23/hygiene-is-the-first-priority-nepal-looks-to-clean-up-its-act-on-healthcare,"It was midnight when Kalpana and Rohit Agri had to take their three-day-old daughter, Kritima, to Bardiya hospital in western Nepal. She was listless and, despite the antibiotics she’d been prescribed, had developed a high fever. Hearing her struggling to breathe, they woke a neighbour to take them. Kritima was admitted with life-threatening neonatal sepsis, probably an infection she had picked up in the hospital where she was born. A recent Lancet paper found that infections acquired in hospitals are the third-biggest contributor to antimicrobial resistance. And as superbugs spread and antibiotic resistance rises, more children are at risk. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), sepsis and meningitis account for 15% of global neonatal deaths. In Nepal, 3.5 million people still lack basic access to water while 11.3 million do not have use of a decent toilet. This week, minsters at the World Health Assembly in Geneva will debate a resolution to ensure adequate water, sanitation and hygiene (Wash) are provided in health facilities. More than 1.5 billion people use health centres that lack decent toilets, according to global estimates compiled by the WHO and Unicef. Two years ago, Bardiya hospital opened a ward to deal with all but the most complicated cases of sepsis. More than 200 babies have since been treated. The demand is constant. Last year, more than 1,000 babies were delivered at the 55-bed hospital. “Typically, two to three women give birth here daily,” says Sangita Regima, a senior nurse who underwent special training to deal with sepsis. “But we can have up to eight women here in labour at once.” With the arrival of federalism in Nepal and the 2015 constitution setting out citizens’ rights, there have been rapid steps forward in sanitation. In 1990, coverage was just 6%; today, following campaigns to eliminate open defecation, it is 99%. Since decentralisation, the country has been reorganised into 753 municipalities, seven provinces and a slimmed-down central government, explains Lal Bahadur Shrestha, mayor of Badhaiyatal. Municipalities can raise their own taxes and develop their own policies, providing they are true to the spirit of the constitution. Shrestha now plans to open five new health centres and a tiny hospital in the area, part of 2,500 health facilities the central government has approved for rollout over the next two years. Finding medical professionals and trained, well-equipped cleaners for these centres will be a challenge. Just half of heath facilities in Nepal have both water and soap available, and only a quarter have disinfectants or sanitisers. The government has long supported infection control, but there are still gaps in provision. The medical staff in Bardiya are efficient. Regima bustles between the two newborns supporting the mothers as they breastfeed. The importance of good hygiene permeates everything the staff say, but the grim reality of the lavatories by the maternity ward may just explain why a baby like Kritima, who was only just below average weight at birth, might succumb to such a dangerous infection. Nepal’s healthcare is moving in the right direction, says Dr Subhash Pandey, medical superintendent at Bardiya hospital Antibiotic prescription is not confined to doctors, he says – anyone can walk into a pharmacy and ask for them. Research has shown a high correlation between people paying for medicines over the counter, which is common in low-income countries, and rising resistance. The course may not be followed properly and Pandey and colleagues take account of this when prescribing for stubborn infection. Article 35 of the constitution on the right to health grants each citizen access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Working through a local partner, Backward Society for Education (Base), WaterAid has begun improving Wash in health facilities in the province with funding from Giorgio Armani’s Acqua for life campaign, focusing on birthing centres in an attempt to reduce newborn deaths. The 2016 demographic and health survey shows that in Nepal 5% of under-fives get diarrhoeal diseases. Given that only half of healthcare facilities in the country have areas where disinfection can take place – or even for staff and patients to wash their hands – it’s not surprising that it will take approximately $6bn more funding for Nepal to meet WASH targets contained in the sustainable development goals. More women are giving birth in health centres. In Nepal they are incentivised to do so with a 1,000 rupee (£11.35) benefit, but health gains are at risk if women deliver in unsanitary conditions. The next WaterAid project will take place at Bhimmapur health post, a catchment area of 10,000 people a few miles from the Indian border. Yujin Kushmi, who runs the post, his shirt stained with iodine after delivering a baby girl of 2.22kg earlier in the day, is monitoring the mother, Mina Tharu, for haemorrhage. The 30-year-old, who previously had a stillbirth, went into labour around 4am and had to walk for 30 minutes to get here. Ideally, Kushmi would have referred her to a better equipped centre, but she was fully dilated on arrival and couldn’t afford the journey in any case. Everyone is eligible for a transport grant, but payments come months later. The mother of four says she’s not planning on more children. Base will start work here shortly to provide clean water. The existing supply is mud coloured, and there’s a problem with arsenic contamination. This and the toilets are patients’ main complaints. The area is prone to flooding and Kushmi is embarrassed about only having one handwashing point. He urgently wants change. In the past two years, he and a colleague, Bishnu Prasad Tharu, have opened a birthing centre, a huge step forward for local women. They anticipate 270 deliveries a year. There’s enough soap, but they lack disinfectants and surgical gloves. There can also be shortages of instruments and gauze. “Now, hygiene is the first priority,” he says. “There are so many children sick with diarrhoea, pneumonia and respiratory infections.” Cases of infection have gone up to the extent that he and the four other medical staff have questioned the hygiene here, as well as the challenging conditions at some patients’ homes. Adults, too, come in with gastritis and diarrhoea. To prevent infection, Kushmi routinely prescribes a course of antibiotics to all mothers after birth, alongside iron and folic acid. He also gives antibiotics to newborns with a fever or more than 10 blisters, indicating sepsis. There have been 15 cases so far this year. Kritima Agri is now a month old and has doubled her birth weight. Her parents say they can finally relax and enjoy being parents. Her mother would like her to be a doctor: “That way she will help everyone else through her hard work, just as she has been helped,” she says. First, she must complete her course of antibiotics.",Global health; Global development; Nepal; Antibiotics; South and central Asia; World news; World Health Organization; Access to water; Sanitation; Hygiene; Health,Global development
2019-03-11T21:00:21Z,"Fake drugs kill more than 250,000 children a year, doctors warn",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/mar/11/fake-drugs-kill-more-than-250000-children-a-year-doctors-warn,"Doctors have called for an urgent international effort to combat a “pandemic of bad drugs” that is thought to kill hundreds of thousands of people globally every year. A surge in counterfeit and poor quality medicines means that 250,000 children a year are thought to die after receiving shoddy or outright fake drugs intended to treat malaria and pneumonia alone, the doctors warned. More are thought to die from poor or counterfeit vaccines and antibiotics used to treat or prevent acute infections and diseases such as hepatitis, yellow fever and meningitis. Most of the deaths are in countries where a high demand for drugs combines with poor surveillance, quality control and regulations to make it easy for criminal gangs and cartels to infiltrate the market. Often they face only fines or minor sentences if caught. “The penalties are a slap on the hand, but we are talking about murder by fake medicine here,” said Joel Breman, a senior scientist emeritus at the US National Institutes of Health in Maryland. Tests on drugs in the field have identified fake and ineffective copies of a vast range of drugs including antimalarials, antibiotics and cardiovascular and cancer medicines. Many fakes originate in China and India and have been found to contain everything from printer ink and paint to arsenic. Lifestyle drugs, such as Viagra, dominate the market for counterfeit medicines. Beyond the fakes that are made and sold by criminal gangs are poor-quality medicines that lack sufficient active ingredients to work properly, or fail to dissolve correctly when taken. Sloppy manufacturing is often to blame, but others are sold past their shelf life or have degraded in poor storage conditions. Writing in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, doctors from the US government, universities, hospitals and the pharmaceutical firm Pfizer warn that the rise in “falsified and substandard medicines” has become a “public health emergency”. On top of the direct harm they cause, bad drugs are a major driver of antimicrobial resistance, which fuels the rise of superbugs. “This is an urgent public health issue and we need to take action,” Breman said. Up to 10% of drugs in low and middle income countries are poor quality or outright fakes, costing local economies between $10bn and $200bn a year, the report states, and the problem is getting worse. In 2018, Pfizer identified 95 fake products in 113 countries, up from 29 fakes in 75 countries in 2008. In a raft of recommendations, the doctors call for greater support for the World Health Organization’s (WHO) drug surveillance programme and an update to the UN’s sustainable development goals in which governments would ensure at least 90% of the medicines in their countries were of high quality. Registers of fake drugs found in the field should also be made open to the public, the doctors say. Another recommendation is for a global treaty on drug quality that builds in the means to gather evidence on fake drug activities, and sets out extradition agreements so that suspects can face trial in countries they target. Such a treaty would encompass illegal online pharmacies, which doctors say are an increasing part of the problem. Breman said the international community and pharmaceutical companies had to improve the security of the drug supply chain in all countries from the point of manufacture to the patient. There was an immediate need for simple and rapid tests that doctors could use to verify drug quality, he added. “Very little has been done about this and that’s why our recommendations hit specific things that frankly have been evaded by the powers that be,” Breman said. Last month, WHO issued a global alert about a fake cancer drug in Europe and the Americas. The counterfeit drug is packaged to look like Iclusig, an anticancer medicine used to treat adults with chronic myeloid leukaemia and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. WHO said the pill contained nothing but paracetamol. Michael Deats, who leads the vigilance group on fake medicines at WHO in Geneva, said “the highest political will is required” to ensure that global policies on bad drugs make a difference on the ground. More than 110 countries have reported more than 2,000 cases of bad drugs overWHO’s global surveillance and monitoring system, he added, with new cases arriving every day. Bernard Naughton, a researcher in falsified and counterfeit medicines at Oxford University’s Saïd Business School, said fake medicine was a “wicked problem” that called for a combined effort from pharma companies, academia, governments, healthcare practitioners and the public. “The UK legitimate pharmaceutical supply chain is safe but it requires constant monitoring,” he said. “Regarding online pharmacies, there is poor public understanding of how to differentiate between a legitimate online pharmacy and an illegal one. Illegal online pharmacies and the sale of medicines via social media platforms pose the greatest risk to the UK public.”",Science; Global health; Antibiotics; Drugs; Drug resistance,Science
2018-09-28T16:30:45Z,FGM has no place in the 21st century | Letter,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/28/fgm-has-no-place-in-the-21st-century,"Your report (Burkina Faso botched FGM leaves 50 girls in hospital, 18 September) underscores the terrible toll this harmful practice continues to exert around the world. Female genital mutilation inflicts lasting emotional and physical harm on the most vulnerable members of society. It has no medical or religious justification – and no place in the 21st century. Burkina Faso is actually one of the countries that has made a concerted effort to end FGM, which in some communities is seen as a rite of passage for girls. With 86 arrests and 43 convictions in 2017, and mobile courts to take the legal process to communities, the country is a leader in the enforcement of legislation banning the practice. While legislation and enforcement provide a solid basis for tackling the problem, additional measures are needed to encourage communities to abandon the practice. The UNFPA and Unicef are jointly supporting grassroots efforts that unite community leaders, schools, parents and local non-governmental organisations to protect girls from harm. In some communities, FGM has been fully eliminated. In others, it has been replaced by new rites of passage that raise girls’ status rather than inflicting lifelong physical and psychological harm. The UNFPA has set a goal to end practices that harm women and girls by 2030. This is also a target of the UN sustainable development goals, to be achieved the same year. Clearly, there is still a very long way to go: between now and 2030, the UNFPA estimates that 68 million girls around the world – not only in Africa, but also in Asia, Europe and the Americas – may be subjected to female genital mutilation, robbing them of their bodily integrity and violating their human rights.

The “profoundly negative effect on forest and woodland” the writer warns of won’t be the result of an increase of 4 billion mouths. The planet will be two or three degrees hotter by the middle of this century, coasts and even whole countries will be underwater, agriculture impossible, potable water scarce and those trees, bushes and all the life they contained dead. Thirst and starvation, migration and war will cause the deaths of many, if not most, of us human beings and whatever fauna, flora and invertebrates we haven’t already exterminated. It is we who will control our population. Or not. Some delegates at the Poland climate conference knew this, and many others would have objected to politics interfering with our God-given right to propagate. No different, really, from our right to be greedy, selfish, careless and destructive, none of which can be tamed or regulated. Bryna Hellmann Amsterdam, The Netherlands • I can understand the idea that population growth seems to be a taboo topic. Although increased household incomes and wider access to education often result in lower birthrates, these are not the key issues. What is never discussed is that millions of women across the world have no power over their reproduction or their sexual activity. They do not have the right to say “no”. This is a deeply rooted cultural issue, but women’s empowerment is fundamental to our survival. Neither sustainable development goals nor stemming climate change will be achieved until all women have freedom to make their own reproductive decisions. I fear this will take more than the 12 years we have left to slow climate breakdown. Trish Nicholson Northland, New Zealand China is just copying the US playbook Reading your article Beijing calling (14 December), one wonders how many of the media strategies used today by China are copied from the book written by the US media during the 1950s and 1960s to tell the US story well. In fact, one asks oneself, how much is still going on behind the scene where US money is funding media for making the foreign serve the US? And then, lo and behold, five pages later George Monbiot tells us what the Koch brothers are up to in the UK. The parallels are hard to ignore. And, nota bene, this letter is neither funded by the Chinese nor by the Kochs. Martin Skogsbeck Mougins, France Issue of class dominated the Grenfell inquiry I was impressed by the eloquence and sensitivity of Tim Adams’s report on the Grenfell inquiry (14 December). It seems to me that behind this eloquence is one word: class. As with most of the inquiries referenced, the victims were lower class, the judges, lawyers and managers, upper class. The traditional tendency of the upper class is to be deaf to the feelings of the lower classes and to close ranks when called to account. Adams highlights the softening of the judge’s attitude after hearing of the trauma and grief of the survivors and also the influence of Bishop James Jones’s report on the Hillsborough inquiry, which he called “the patronising disposition of unaccountable power”. Could these be signs, almost a thousand years after the Norman conquest, that the British class system is withering?

2018-12-07T21:40:26Z,Gareth Evans and Bob Carr join call for Labor to increase Australia's foreign aid,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/dec/08/gareth-evans-and-bob-carr-join-call-for-labor-to-increase-australias-foreign-aid,"Former Labor ministers including Gareth Evans and Bob Carr have called on their party to increase Australia’s foreign aid. The two former foreign ministers joined the former trade minister John Kerin, the former international development minister Melissa Parke, the former parliamentary secretary Bob McMullan and the former president of the ACTU Sharan Burrow in signing an open letter urging a future Labor government to “take decisive action to rebuild the Australian aid program and ensure that Australia meets its international obligations”. “We live in a political moment defined by extreme inequality, conflicts which force millions of people to seek refuge, and the increasing impacts of climate change and natural disasters,” the letter says. Evans told Guardian Australia it was up to Labor to strengthen Australia’s role in promoting development. “As foreign minister I promoted our leading role in the Asia-Pacific, and as a good international citizen globally. Strong, high-quality Australian aid was critical to this,” Evans said. “It’s so important that the Labor party in government continue our commitment to addressing poverty and good governance through Australian aid. Labor has a proud history of supporting development around the world. That must continue under the next Labor government.” The ministers and other supporters, under the banner Labor For Aid, are calling for the party’s national conference in Adelaide next weekend to commit to moving towards 0.7% of gross national income – a United Nations target which the UK has met – and to increase aid as a percentage every year beginning with a future Labor government’s first budget. In May the federal budget kept Australia’s aid budget frozen at $4.2bn a year – 0.23% of GNI. Labor for Aid also called for progress on the UN’s sustainable development goals, including reducing global poverty. The group said Coalition governments had taken $11.3bn from foreign aid programs and diverted funds from humanitarian projects. Australia’s foreign aid spending was now less than 1% of the federal budget, the lowest proportion in history, it said. This year’s budget included the biggest proportion of aid ever directed towards the Pacific, as Australia seeks to head off growing Chinese influence in the region. The chief executive of the Australian Council for International Development, Marc Purcell, said calls for a Labor commitment on aid just before its national conference were essential. “It’s vital because it’s the right thing for Australia to be doing if we want to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030, but also there’s a geostrategic imperative,” Purcell told Guardian Australia. Purcell cited increases under the government of John Howard, who “essentially rebuilt the relationship with Indonesia after the referendum in East Timor”, and then added the $1bn aid package in response to the Asian tsunami of 2004. The Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd made a commitment to spend 0.5% of GNI on aid, “harnessed to a security council bid”, Purcell said. “There clearly is now a geostrategic concern about a more competitive influence … particularly in the Pacific. “For a Labor government to bite the bullet on the geostrategic need to utilise aid for positive relationships and influence would actually be a breakthrough, and it would be consistent with history.”",Labor party; Australian politics; Australia news; Aid; Bob Carr,Australia news
2018-10-09T17:25:37Z,The time is now for a global pact for the environment | Letter,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/09/the-time-is-now-for-a-new-global-climate-pact,"On 10 April 2018, the United Nations general assembly adopted a resolution that paved the way for negotiations on a global pact for the environment. This international treaty would combine the guiding legal principles for environmental action into one single and far-reaching text. In 2015, the adoption of the sustainable development goals and the Paris climate agreement represented major progress. However, environmental damage persists and is more serious than ever before. The years 2017 and 2018 have seen record-breaking temperatures. Biodiversity continues to decline at a rapid pace. With the global pact for the environment, the international community would be equipped for the first time with a treaty of a general nature that covers all environmental areas. It would be the cornerstone of international environmental law, therefore overseeing the different existing sectoral agreements (climate, biodiversity, waste, pollution, etc), filling the gaps and facilitating their implementation. The treaty would gather principles found in key national and international texts, giving them legal value. Each state legislator would find references to the adoption of more robust environmental laws. The supreme courts would draw from it as a common source of inspiration to build the foundations for global environmental law. Citizens and NGOs would see their environmental rights strengthened while businesses would benefit from the harmonisation of the rules of the game. While we celebrate the 70-year anniversary of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the moment has come for a new chapter in the history of international law. We are calling for the adoption of a third pact, enshrining a new generation of fundamental commitments: the rights and duties of states, public and private entities, and individuals relating to environmental protection.

2019-03-18T13:36:00Z,"I see how climate change will lead to conflict in my home country, Nigeria | Nnimmo Bassey",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/18/school-climate-change-strikers-paris-agreement-fossil-fuels,"Since August 2018 a Swedish teenager, Greta Thunberg, has sat outside her country’s parliament building every Friday rather than in a classroom. She is there to demand that the government takes climate action by implementing the 2015 Paris agreement. While some thought she would give up her strike, her resolve could not be broken by the cold, heat or disapproval from adults. Last Friday children in 72 countries joined what have come to be known as the school strikes against climate change. It is important to note that one of the pillars on which the strike hangs is the Paris climate accord globally endorsed in 2015 at the 21st conference of parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Taken alongside the UN sustainable development goals, the hope is that global temperature rises above preindustrial levels can be kept at 1.5C or “well below” 2C. It is also hoped that with the development goals poverty and hunger can be terminated by 2050. Are these attainable targets? Negotiations on pathways of implementing the Paris climate agreement underscore the fact that there is a global agreement that countries must take action. But the indications of how this would be achieved are not at the level of ambition needed to counter, slow or stop the looming climate chaos. The problem with voluntary emissions reduction by nations is that such actions would only achieve the targets if the key polluters do their fair share of cutting emissions at source. This is not the scenario that is playing out, however. A special report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicated that the current ambition as set out until 2030 will likely result in a global warming of about 3C by 2100 and that this warming would continue. Unless the most polluting nations raise their emissions reduction ambitions, we are on track towards the literal incineration of the planet. Extreme weather events are already wreaking havoc on many regions. Small-island developing nations are at extreme risk of being swallowed up by the oceans. Nigeria and other African nations are at risk of highly challenged agricultural systems and intensified poverty regimes. Even with the best socioeconomic improvements in our nations, the consequences of 1.5C or 2C temperature increase will mean elevated health risks, water stress, human insecurity, damaged livelihoods and lowered levels of wellbeing. Temperature rises will lead to increased desertification, higher ocean acidification and migration of marine species to higher latitudes. The impacts on my home country, Nigeria, will be dire. Water stress will be higher in the Sahelian area and this will compel a higher rate of southward migration of pastoralists and farmers. Ocean acidification and coastal erosion, on the other hand, will force coastal communities to relocate into the hinterland. This is a scenario that will breed conflict. The strike for climate action is a significant step by children and teenagers, especially because it is their future that is at stake. Thunberg has been clear in her many speeches to policymakers and leaders. She insists that nations must wake up and that their sluggishness is a mark of laziness and irresponsibility. At the UN climate change conference in Katowice in December, she pointedly stated: “You only speak of green eternal economic growth because you are too scared of being unpopular. You only talk about moving forward with the same bad ideas that got us into this mess, even when the only sensible thing to do is pull the emergency brake. You are not mature enough to tell it like it is. Even that burden you leave to us children.” One of the clear ways to apply that brake is to quickly phase out the dependence on fossil fuels for energy production and transportation. The truth is that the world must abandon fossil fuels within this century. The decline in use of this dirty energy must happen now. Rather than take this pathway, politicians lend their ears to fossil fuel corporations even in the corridors of the UN climate change conferences. Rather than cut emissions, the tendency is towards what is termed net-zero emissions. This means a polluter can keep polluting once they buy a licence for the actions by showing that an equivalent amount is being absorbed by trees in a poor community’s forest or that similar amounts are absorbed by the oceans or are reflected back into space through geoengineering. Sadly, Nigeria keeps flaring gas in the Niger Delta – a major local contributor of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Our government’s deadline for ending gas flaring in 2020 does not appear achievable given progress on the ground. When children call adults immature, we must be attentive. It is not an insult. It is a plea for us to think of the future of our children. They insist that if there is no future there is no reason to sit in a classroom. We must listen to the children. Children of the world must unite in this struggle to force adults away from short-term measures predicated on profit, political gains and their lack of concern for the planet and the future. • Nnimmo Bassey is director of the ecological thinktank Health of Mother Earth Foundation",Climate crisis; Greta Thunberg; Environmental activism; Paris climate agreement; Environment; Protest; Nigeria; World news; UK news,Opinion
2019-05-06T11:00:09Z,Loss of biodiversity is just as catastrophic as climate change | Robert Watson,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/06/biodiversity-climate-change-mass-extinctions,"A colleague recently described how fish would swim into her clothing when she was a child bathing in the ocean off the coast of Vietnam, but today the fish are gone and her children find the story far-fetched. Another recalled his experiences just last year in Cape Town – one of the world’s most attractive tourism and leisure destinations – when more than 2 million people faced the nightmare prospect of all taps, in every home and business, running dry. These instances, on opposite sides of the world, are two faces of the same problem; the relentless pressure we are putting on biodiversity and the contributions that nature makes to our wellbeing, and the way we humans are changing the Earth’s climate. The rich variety of nature provides us with the food we eat, the water we drink and the air we breathe, and countless moments of personal inspiration spent in forests and mountains, exploring beaches and rivers, or even listening to a simple birdsong in a quiet moment. We have all assumed that nature would always be here for us and our children. However, our boundless consumption, shortsighted reliance on fossil fuels and our unsustainable use of nature now seriously threaten our future. Environmentalists, scientists and indigenous peoples have been sounding the alarm for decades. Our understanding of the overexploitation of the planet has advanced with grim, sharp clarity over that time. We have entered an era of rapidly accelerating species extinction, and are facing the irreversible loss of plant and animal species, habitats and vital crops, while coming face to face with the horrific impacts of global climate change. In 2018 alone, there were deadly heatwaves across Europe and south-east Asia, while the US experienced floods and wildfires. Insurance companies went under, unable to bear the costs of rebuilding after extreme weather events. There is a rising wave of collective anger and anxiety. The spectre of such environmental damage has caused grave concern, especially among global youth, about our inability to sustain our health, productivity, security and wellbeing. New realities have pulled back the curtain and exposed initiatives such as the banning of plastic straws as the drop in the ocean they truly are when it comes to protecting the future for ourselves, our children and all the species with which we share our planet. We must now consider the animals, insects, plants and all the places in which they live. Despite the profound threat of biodiversity loss, it is climate change that has long been considered the most pressing environmental concern. That changed this week in Paris, when representatives from 130 nations approved the most comprehensive assessment of global biodiversity ever undertaken. The report, spearheaded by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), found that nature is being eroded at rates unprecedented in human history. One million species are currently threatened with extinction and we are undermining the entire natural infrastructure on which our modern world depends. Nature powers human endeavours – underpinning productivity, culture and even our beliefs and identities. But our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide are under threat. We are exploiting nature faster than it can replenish itself. The IPBES assessment has shown the strong interrelationship between climate change, the loss of biodiversity and human wellbeing. Climate change has been identified as a primary driver of biodiversity loss, already altering every part of nature. Likewise, the loss of biodiversity contributes to climate change, for example when we destroy forests we emit carbon dioxide, the major “human-produced” greenhouse gas. We cannot solve the threats of human-induced climate change and loss of biodiversity in isolation. We either solve both or we solve neither. The IPBES report shows that governments and businesses are nowhere close to doing enough. The world is on track to miss the targets of the Paris agreement, the Aichi biodiversity targets and 80% of the UN sustainable development goals (food, water and energy security), because of our poor stewardship of the natural world. However, the good news is that there are many policies and technologies that will limit global temperature rise and address the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. These will also offer our last, best chance to limit human-induced climate change and preserve the greatest amount of biodiversity possible. The way we produce and use energy, and farm, use our soils, protect coastal ecosystems and treat our forests will make or break our future, but it can also help us have a better quality of life. We still have time – though very limited – to turn things around. It won’t be easy. It requires massive changes, from removing subsidies that lead to the destruction of nature and future warming of the Earth, to enacting laws that encourage the protection of nature; from reducing our growing addiction to fossil-fuel energy and natural resource consumption, to rethinking the definition of a rewarding life. Our current agricultural system is broken. If we keep producing food using current unsustainable agricultural practices, we will undermine future food production. But we already have more than enough food to go around. Today 815 million people go to bed hungry, 38 million more than in 2015. Yet, if food waste were a country, its emissions would rank third in the world, after China and the US, producing 8% of manmade emissions. We need to redirect government subsidies towards more sustainable and regenerative farming. This will not only contribute towards absorbing carbon and reducing the emissions of other greenhouse gases, it can also halt a frightening trajectory where farmland is so overloaded that eventually it just stops growing crops. We simply cannot afford the cost of inaction. Change of the magnitude required will mean a different life for everyone, but the costs of doing nothing will be much higher. The G7 environment ministers, currently meeting in France, have the opportunity to return to their capitals with the freshly approved IPBES report. The world needs them to reflect our current level of crisis at the heads of state meeting later this year. The UK parliament has endorsed a motion to declare a formal climate and environment emergency, which is a start, but action and budgets from governments and business will need to follow. As policymakers around the world grapple with the twin threats of climate change and biodiversity loss, it is essential that they understand the linkages between the two so that their decisions and actions address both. The world needs to recognise that loss of biodiversity and human-induced climate change are not only environmental issues, but development, economic, social, security, equity and moral issues as well. The future of humanity depends on action now. If we do not act, our children and all future generations will never forgive us. • Sir Robert Watson is chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), and former chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)",Biodiversity; Climate crisis; Wildlife; Conservation; Farming; Extreme weather; Environment; World news; UK news,Opinion
2019-08-29T11:27:16Z,Burning issue: how fashion's love of leather is fuelling the fires in the Amazon,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/aug/29/burning-issue-how-fashions-love-of-leather-is-fuelling-the-fires-in-the-amazon,"The level of destruction is almost impossible to fathom. About 41,000 fires have been recorded by scientists in the Brazilian Amazon since January, with more than half of those in the past three weeks – hence the apocalyptic headlines. Every minute, the equivalent of a football field and a half of the so-called lungs of the Earth is incinerated. The rainforest isn’t just totemic, we know that the future stability of the climate rests on preserving it. To be an onlooker to this burning triggers the type of overwhelming anxiety that probably won’t be soothed by wearing a “save the rainforest” T-shirt like we did in the 1980s. In fact, that’s the last thing we should be doing, because the Amazon burn is very much a fashion crisis, connected to the leather your shoes are made from and the bag on your shoulder. We need action. Earlier this week, the fashion industry made a move, as LVMH, the world’s top luxury goods firm, pledged €10m to fight the Amazon burn, adding to the $20m pledged by the G7 with President Macron as frontman. “Protecting the environment is not just about words and speeches or signing declarations of principle,” read the statement accompanying the LVMH pledge by CEO Bernard Arnault and director Yann Arthus-Bertrand, adding: “It also requires taking concrete collective actions when dangers arise in order to provide resources for local specialists and work together to save our planet.” Except that the industry should have done far more far earlier – and has for years been tacitly driving destruction. The causes of this are often far away from the actual forest. This has been evident for a decade. In 2009, Greenpeace published Slaughtering the Amazon, a report that should have – and nearly did – change everything. The report concluded that the demand for leather was fuelling the destruction of the Amazon in its own right, not just accidentally as a by-product of beef. Researchers found cattle ranchers were clearing rainforest illegally despite laws protecting it, including Brazil’s “forest code”. One hectare of rainforest was being lost to ranches every 18 seconds. Through a murky supply chain, Brazilian beef companies were supplying leather to leading global fashion brands and retailers, across price points and across retail markets. To add insult to injury, the whole venture was underpinned by state-funded banks. In effect, while former president Lula made speeches about saving the “lungs of the Earth” (the Brazilian Amazon stores 80-120bn tonnes of carbon), the state was sponsoring its wholesale destruction. In the aftermath of the report and on the trail of a nascent sustainable fashion movement, I found many stories on the ground in Brazil. In 2012, I travelled to cattle-producing states with agro-forestry researchers to meet ranchers. The researchers were trying to persuade them that there was greater economic value in saving the rainforest biome than in destroying it. They very nearly succeeded. Two things were stunningly clear to me from the outset. While the Amazon is more closely connected to iconic species of megafauna – including jaguars, tapirs and all manner of large, wildly coloured birds – the whole country is really about the cow, specifically the Nelore, an Indian import with folds of skin collecting around its neck. From 1993 to 2013, the Brazilian herd grew 200% to more than 60m cows. Everywhere you looked as evening fell across treeless ranches, you’d see their forms silhouetted against the dusty backdrop. The second was how deeply ingrained the slash and burn model of agriculture was in ranchers. This was a hangover from the 1970s when across the country government posters urged prospectors to head to the Amazon and settle the land. The quickest way to gain land rights? Chop the trees, burn them, put cattle on the land. Never stop. Keep pushing forwards into the rainforest. This is the deeply held ethos that Bolsonaro has been able to tap into. But back then, all was not lost. Ranchers could often be persuaded to stop burning to produce leather for a concerned and engaged fashion market that wanted to promote leather goods that were certified as zero deforestation. In 2013, Gucci launched a collection of bags produced through a pilot project with ranchers and NGOs at Paris fashion week. On a wider level, things changed after the Greenpeace report as environmental groups pressured publicly listed conglomerates to delink their supply chains from Amazonian destruction. In 2011, an agreement between one of Brazil’s biggest meat companies, JBS, and others was signed with federal prosecutors. They agreed not to buy cattle directly from embargoed or illegally deforested areas. The Brazilian meat companies hurried to register the ranches that they sourced from into a Rural Environmental Registry that could be confirmed by satellite imagery. In October 2009, just 2% of JBS’s purchases were from registered properties. By 2013, that figure was 96%. A later study by US geographer Holly Gibbs showed these initiatives had worked and that zero deforestation commitments could be effective. What a tragedy then, that 10 years on we are witnessing the destruction of the Amazon and dismantling of these precious agreements. A recent Guardian investigation found cattle ranchers who were seemingly breaking the embargo linked to big meat companies. Perhaps no system, however tough, could have withstood the determined assault on the Amazon by Bolsonaro, who is making good on his promises to slash environmental protections whatever the cost. But it is hard not to wish that it had been made more difficult for him. Truthfully, the fashion industry has remained complacent about leather from the Amazon and, outside of pilot projects, has failed to commit to zero deforestation supply chains in a big way. The €10m pledged earlier this week by LVMH could have been spent to great effect over the past decade on monitoring and enforcement. Complacency is a contagion and this one has spread to us, as fashion consumers. The global production of footwear was up to 23.5bn pairs by 2018, accounting for 55% of all leather production. Almost nobody asks where the cows are from, never mind requesting certified zero-deforestation leather. Brands swear that their leather is from Europe rather than 6,000 miles away in the Brazilian Amazon. I find this unlikely. If all the shoes professing Italian heritage really were from Italian cattle, cows would drink from the Trevi fountain and chew the cud in Piazza San Marco. If the crisis in the Amazon does one thing, I hope it wakes us up to the true cost of Amazon leather. More conscious Buying consciously from the Amazon means supporting brands that are Amazon-first, putting the ecology and people of the biome above profit and volume. Here are our top brands investing in the Amazon rather than exploiting it: Veja The Brazilian Amazon is the only place on Earth where rubber trees grow in a wild state. Environmentalist Bia Saldanha moved her family to the Chico Mendes reserve in Acre (named after the activist murdered in 1998 for his work) many years ago and works with 20 seringueiros families rubber tapping wild trees sustainably. Two or three times a week, the seringueiros collect 12kg of wild rubber primarily destined for the soles of Veja trainers, made in Portugal in a fair-trade factory. In 2018, this collaboration preserved 90 hectares of forest, says Saldanha. Auá Jair Bolsonaro has also declared war on the 400 indigenous communities who inhabit the rainforest. These groups, according to Fiona Watson, director of research at Survival International, possess “vast and acute botanical and zoological knowledge … and protect some of the largest and most biodiverse forests on Earth”. Auá is a southern Brazilian brand that works with artists and indigenous communities to develop collections where all are equal partners, with the avoidance of cultural appropriation – one of fashion’s biggest pitfalls – in mind. The Auá team, which includes an inhouse anthropologist, negotiate the terms of use of patterns and designs from indigenous communities. Osklen Osklen is one of Brazil’s most established sustainable fashion brands. The company was founded by a former doctor, Oskar Metsavaht, in 1988 and is known for pioneering sustainable fabrics. The brand’s motto is “as sustainable as possible, as soon as possible” – he refuses to wait for certification bodies to catch up. An early avoider of cattle leather on environmental grounds, Metsavaht has pioneered the use of skins from the pirarucu fish found in Amazonian rivers and lakes. Olsken bags from pirarucu are sold all over the world, generating a new income source for the area. Olsken’s sustainable practices and materials are being studied by the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Bottletop The London-based accessories brand has an enduring relationship with Brazil. The classic Bottletop bag is made from ring pulls (recovered from Brazilian landfill), handpainted in an atelier in Itapua that works to fair-trade principles, and then linked together with leather that is certified zero-deforestation. The brand also produces Together wrist-bands, promoting the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. What can we do? In response to the Amazon fires and an Extinction Rebellion protest outside the Brazilian embassy in London last Friday, a promise of match-funding has been made to the tune of $350,000 for the Climate Emergency Fund.

2018-07-02T12:27:21Z,Social work is booming worldwide – because it's proven to work | Rory Truell,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/02/social-work-booming-worldwide-costa-rica,"Social work is the fastest-growing profession internationally – and in many countries, statistics point towards its significant further expansion. In the US, for example, despite cuts to public administration by the Trump government, the Bureau of Labour Statistics predicts a 16% growth of the profession between 2016 and 2026. Membership of the International Federation of Social Workers has also shown unprecedented growth, with a 60% jump in the number of recognised national professional bodies between 2011 and 2017. There are many reasons why social work is a growing sector. One is sound evidence showing a positive economic return when governments invest in social services. When social workers are active in a community, it tends to have a positive impact on crime rates, health statistics, school attendance and employment. Another reason is that new legislation is being introduced in many countries recognising the vital role that social work can play. One example is in Costa Rica. Despite decades of UN and government aid, 38% of the population lived in extreme poverty. Social workers proposed new a new approach. Puente al Desarrollo – A Bridge to Development – is human rights-based legislation that has seen government agencies and communities coming together to address social problems – and support people in meeting their aspirations. The new law applies a social work approach of responding to all the issues that contribute to poverty and strengthening community systems of self-care. Cristian Rodríguez Barrantes, a social worker on a drug-smuggling route in the Costa Rican slums, describes how the law works in practice. “We have a three-layered model, starting with encouraging all people to be involved with shaping their social services,” he says. “Communities identify their own solutions. This brings people together and they think beyond normal services. They want programmes to end violence, community-wide empowerment charters for women and girls, drug prevention clinics and basic schooling for all generations. When people are given options, they take them.” The next layer, the development and generation of capacities, includes community education programmes, such as IT training, English and parenting. “Education becomes a part of everyday life for many,” says Barrantes. The final layer is economic independence, which involves working with the business community to create jobs. “We have a business incubator in every slum,” says Barrantes. “People know how to sow, they know how to grow and make things, they have the skills. What they need is to know how to use their skills beyond the day-to-day; they want business planning skills.” Although the legislation was only introduced in 2016, studies revealed that by the following year, multidimensional poverty was reduced by 41%. This was achieved without any extra government or UN funding. At the opening address of the 2016 world social work conference, the then-UN secretary general, Ban-ki Moon, said via video that sustainable development goals could not be achieved without social workers. He was right – and inspirational social workers like Barrantes are needed to shape those services. The achievements of social workers in Costa Rica and many other places have highlighted the profession to the United Nations and governments that want to solve problems of marginalisation and poverty. Such projects are invaluable in promoting the profession – and helping to make sustainable development goals a reality. • Rory Truell is secretary-general of the International Federation of Social Workers, which is a joint organiser of the Social Work, Education and Social Development Conference in Dublin on 4-7 July",Social care; Society; Costa Rica; Americas; World news; Society Professionals,Society
2019-04-17T16:54:16Z,Arresting the climate change catastrophe | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/17/arresting-the-disaster-that-is-climate-change,"Our unsustainable lifestyles and commitment to perpetual economic growth have become the major drivers of climate change and loss of biodiversity on Earth (Only rebellion will prevent an ecological apocalypse, 15 April). Our politicians fail to grasp the scale and urgency of the risk humanity faces. The UK signed up to the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs) in 2015, but has yet to develop a coherent and rigorous national plan for their domestic and international implementation. Encouragingly, the SDGs form a new roadmap for our future that in principle aligns the economy with the Earth’s life support systems. Yet, a recent report by the Stockholm Resilience Centre shows that attempting to achieve the socioeconomic goals using conventional growth policies would make it virtually impossible to reduce the speed of global warming and environmental degradation. The research team tested three other scenarios, and the only one that met all goals implemented systemic transformational change. A key element was reducing inequality by a redistribution of wealth, work and income, including ensuring that the 10% richest people take no more that 40% of the income. We clearly have an unprecedented and immense challenge before us, with little choice but to engage as a mass movement to create a system-wide transformation in our politics and our economy. Stephen Martin Visiting professor, University of the West of England Stephen Sterling Emeritus professor of sustainability education, Plymouth University • Both Extinction Rebellion and the climate strikes are reminders that we need to rebuild our societies now if we are to avoid them facing climate collapse in the near future. But both initiatives need to avoid the fate of the Occupy movement, which had huge support 10 years ago but disintegrated because of a lack of precise demands and concrete policy goals. Fortunately, many such policies already exist. The organisation I founded, the World Future Council, has identified the best policy solutions available in countries, regions and cities worldwide. British Columbia has a carbon tax. Maryland, US, has obligatory environmental literacy education. Rwanda has a successful reforestation policy. Japan has an effective energy conservation law. Costa Rica has an exemplary biodiversity law. These provide starting points. But the UK has gone in the opposite way: 10 years ago the WFC helped MPs introduce feed-in tariff legislation (originating in Germany) to speed up the production of renewable energy. But the coalition government hastened to emasculate it. As many proposals are rejected over cost, a key recommendation is the adaptation of quantitative easing to fund the energy transition. One WFC proposal is for central banks to buy fossil fuel “stranded assets” on condition the money paid is invested in renewables. How this can be done sustainably is explained in our study “Unlocking the trillions”. As central banks cannot go bankrupt in their own currency, they can also buy – and add to their reserves – long-term and low- or zero-interest bonds to kickstart the required emergency reforms in poor countries. Jakob von Uexkull Founder, World Future Council • Larry Elliott is informative on a subject that matters, as usual (Threadneedle Street’s timely warning for banks and insurers: take climate change seriously, 16 April). But insurers have taken it seriously since at least 2009, when a representative of Munich Re wrote: “Climate change probably already accounts for a significant share of economic losses from weather-related natural catastrophes in the period since 1980, which totalled $1.6tn (in original values). “In the light of these facts, it is disappointing no breakthrough was achieved at the Copenhagen climate summit in December 2009. At Munich Re, we look closely at a multitude of risks and how best to handle them. Risks that change in the course of time are especially hazardous. Climate change is just such a risk of change.” But even the premium increases 10 years later don’t appear to have cut emissions sufficiently. So the Bank of England must convince the government to take more effective action. For example, as in the second world war, introduce rationing of any production of greenhouse gases. David Murray Wallington, Surrey • Are US college courses teaching how not to be duped by bullshit really necessary (‘Calling bullshit’: the college class on how not to be duped by the news, theguardian.com, 17 April)? If students haven’t developed their critical thinking faculty by the time they get to college, they are probably lost to the agencies of disinformation and manipulation. In Britain, it is obvious that our education system, designed as it is to provide compliant labour to increase the wealth of a few, has failed when its cities are filled with humanity-saving, peaceful demonstrators. It is inspirational to observe their ability to recognise what is truly important and disregard the odium of passersby – normal people going about their business, in many cases to finance or produce goods harmful to humanity and the natural world. These protesters are the freethinkers who have escaped the bullshit net. Geoff Naylor Winchester, Hampshire • In This Changes Everything, Naomi Klein defines one legacy of the free market: “In virtually every country the political class accepts the premise that it is not the place of government to tell large corporations what they can and cannot do, even when public health and welfare – indeed the habitability of our shared home – are clearly at stake.” In the streets, yes, but in the ballot box we bring about the inevitable and dismiss our free-market political class. We build a new system. John Airs Liverpool • I admire Ben Smoke’s action at Stansted (Journal, 16 April), but disagree with him about arrest, though agree about not glorifying it and being clear about the consequences. I am a Quaker, a psychotherapist member of the Climate Psychology Alliance, which aims to support activists therapeutically, and a member of Extinction Rebellion. What we need is a mass movement with arrest as a possible and necessary part of it. When thousands join us in solidarity and put this issue before everything else, the state will have to listen and take action.

2018-09-17T18:53:59Z,IMF boss: it should be politically incorrect for firms not to have senior women,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/17/christine-lagarde-calls-for-more-women-in-top-business-roles,"The head of the International Monetary Fund has said it should be “politically incorrect” for companies not to have a woman in a senior position. Christine Lagarde said even companies with “no moral compass” should recognise they can boost their profits through promoting women to senior and boardroom positions. “We need to make it politically incorrect not to have women on boards, not to have women CEOs, not to have women in the boardroom,” she said. In a speech in London, Lagarde said tackling gender inequality would boost economic growth in developing nations, as she urged businesses worldwide to appoint more women to senior posts. Lagarde said increasing the proportion of women in prominent business and finance industry jobs could raise economic dynamism and shift firms into thinking about the long-term future of the planet. Warning that greater effort was required to meet the sustainable development goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations, which includes ending all forms of gender discrimination, Lagarde used a speech in London to say: “By bringing more women into the fold, the economy can benefit from their talents, skills, unique perspectives and ideas. This diversity should boost productivity and lead to higher wages for all.” In a stark example of the challenge to meet the SDG on gender equality, set by the UN in 2015 to achieve by the end of the next decade, Lagarde said about 90% of countries around the world had some legal restriction on women’s economic activity. “The sad reality is that girls and women all over the world continue to face the daily indignities of discrimination, harassment, and too often violence as well,” she said. Lowering gender gaps in health and education, supporting financial inclusion, investing in infrastructure and ensuring better access to clean water and sanitation for women would, however, help create a “virtuous cycle” for the world economy. “Invest in the SDGs and boost women’s empowerment, which in turn lays the groundwork for broader SDG success,” she said. Outlining the importance for developing nations, she said reducing gender inequality by 10 percentage points in sub-Saharan African countries could boost growth by two percentage points over five years. Alongside eradicating gender discrimination against women and girls everywhere, the goals for global development set by the UN include reducing the proportion of people living in poverty by at least half, improving access to education, tackling climate change and ending world hunger by 2030.",Christine Lagarde; Sustainable development goals; Women; International Monetary Fund (IMF); World news; Business; Economics; Inequality; United Nations; Gender; Gender pay gap; London; UK news; Feminism,World news
2018-10-08T16:42:28Z,Richard Northcote obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/richard-northcote-obituary,"“I’d like to taste the freedom that nature holds so high, to wander round a global dream before I have to die.” That was the prophetic verse of a 17-year-old Richard Northcote, who ultimately lived in many countries and travelled extensively. His dream was the creation of a sustainable world. As chief sustainability officer for Covestro, a manufacturer of high-tech polymer materials, my father, Richard, who has died suddenly aged 58, found an organisation that shared his passion. Thanks to his enthusiastic advocacy, Covestro embraced the UN sustainable development goals, helping to launch innovative products and technologies that reduce environmental impact. My father was passionate about a project to produce solar dryers and refrigerators that enabled small farmers in India to reduce crop wastage and increase their income. He was proud of Covestro’s contribution to Solar Impulse – the solar aircraft that flew around the world without fuel – of ultra-lightweight and insulating materials. Born in Kilwinning, North Ayrshire, to Eric, who served in a variety of roles in Hong Kong’s police force and ended up as acting director of immigration, and Theresa (nee Quinn), a teacher, Richard lived in Hong Kong, along with his siblings Maureen, Frances and Eric, until 1971, when the family returned to Scotland. He studied at St Andrew’s academy in Saltcoats, North Ayrshire, then began an economics degree at Glasgow University, while also playing football for Ayr United. He left university, in 1979, before graduating to take up a job as a quantity surveyor with Costain Civil Engineering, gaining a diploma in quantity surveying from Croydon College of Technology. In 1985 he took up a job as a construction journalist in Bahrain, reporting for Gulf Construction. By 1987 he was editor-in-chief of all Al Hilal newspaper titles, based in Hong Kong. He returned to the UK in 1991 as editor of Construction Weekly, then the Engineer, and later moved into corporate communications with ICI, Huntsman and Bayer. In 2009 he joined Covestro, formerly Bayer Material Science. He also sat on the steering committee of the Oxford University Business Economics Programme and was an adviser to the board of the European Institute for Industrial Leadership. A Celtic and Scotland football supporter, a firm believer in Scottish independence and a keen skier, Richard was often at the centre of lively discussios that could last for hours. He was a visionary and an innovator. Richard’s first marriage, to Janet Harms, ended in divorce. He is survived by Méabh (nee De Búrca), a policy analyst at the European commission, whom he married in 1995, their children, Catriona and Róisín, his children from his first marriage, Alex and me, and his siblings Maureen and Eric. Frances predeceased him.",Environment; Sustainable development; Scotland; Media,Environment
2020-02-16T12:00:28Z,Why are millions of children in the UK not getting enough to eat?,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/feb/16/food-poverty-millions-children-uk-not-enough-to-eat,"Sarah Batts shows me up a narrow staircase and into her one-bedroom flat. It’s in the converted roof space in a not-great area of Eastbourne. The flat is crammed full of baby equipment for her 15-month-old daughter, Scarlette. Stiflingly hot in late summer, there’s nowhere to sit and eat a meal, partly because the place is tiny and partly because, in common with households with small children across the land, every flat surface including the dining table is covered with stuff. After working in a pet shop for 14 years, Batts, 38, now can’t hold down a job due to poor health. In any case, since her daughter’s birth she has looked after Scarlette on her own. She is dependent on benefits and gets around £250 per week. Her monthly rent is £580, then there’s bills, and she usually allows £25 for her weekly food shop. Budgeting, she says, “is pretty hard, because you don’t get that much. I probably do spend way too much on food.” She orders groceries online because she can’t drive and her illness means she struggles to leave her flat. “I worry about money pretty much all the time,” she says. “I always end up with nothing at the end of the month.” More than four million children in one of the richest countries in the world are growing up in poverty, their access to adequate nutrition compromised. Beyond the misery and stress of not knowing where the next meal is coming from, it is well established that poor diet is linked to coronary heart disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes and some forms of cancer. The situation is now so dire that after declaring that food insecurity is significant and growing in the UK, with levels among the worst in Europe, particularly for children, parliament’s environmental audit committee last year recommended that the government should appoint a minister for hunger. Schools, charities and groups of concerned citizens have been trying to tackle the issue by offering free dinners for pupils who may not even be getting one square meal a day in the holidays, community lunch clubs and, of course, the record high in use of food banks. With a lot of thought and careful planning, feeding a family on a severely restricted budget “is possible if money’s tight for a few weeks – but not for years on end”, says Clare Hackney, co-founder with her friend, Sue Morris, of the not-for-profit company, Community Stuff. The two women met six years ago while running the Eastbourne public consultation for Big Local, a nationwide initiative that puts people in charge of a million pounds of Lottery money to spend on issues that they decide are local priorities – it has since funded Community Stuff to put on cookery classes for individuals trying to eat on punishingly low incomes, as well as most recently a Friday lunch club for people who are socially isolated. “If you’re on minimum wage with a zero-hours contract, or you’re disabled, or have learning difficulties or mental health issues, then providing decent food day in, day out is difficult,” Hackney continues. “It only takes one emergency – your cooker or fridge breaking down, for instance – and then what? You haven’t got any savings as saving isn’t possible, so you’re now in crisis and you’re tempted to take out loans at exorbitant rates to fix the problem. The other option is to not heat your home, not pay the rent or not buy food. Things can very quickly spiral out of control.” Batts recently went on a Community Stuff cookery course. She is now trying out the six-week “empty cupboard plan” chapter from the recipe book Hackney and Morris published called Beyond the Foodbank. The recipes are designed to help people trying to feed themselves in straitened circumstances – including living in emergency or temporary hostel accommodation – to make creative use of the often uninspiring dried and tinned goods given out by food banks. The empty cupboard plan assumes £16 for a week’s shop for one person; this has just been revised upwards from an initial sum of £14 to allow for more fresh fruit and veg. It also assumes a kitchen cupboard with not a single ingredient in it at the start, and provides week-by-week, costed shopping lists with accompanying recipes that provide varied, nutritionally balanced meals. These include spaghetti with tomato sauce and fried bacon pieces; potato, onion and carrot bake; fish pie; sausage meatballs; and chicken and broccoli risotto. The dishes focus on simplicity and taste, but you don’t get any culinary thrills on £16 a week. You don’t get puddings either. The nutritionist who was consulted banned the inclusion of a pot of jam because sugar is empty calories. Hackney rolls her eyes. She knows treats matter. I suspect she might sneak some jam into the next edition. While clearly delighted that local food banks are now giving out the recipe book to clients she hopes will benefit, Morris emphasises that the answer to food poverty is not ever niftier budgeting, better meal planning or homilies on cooking from scratch. “Lots of people have poor mental health, or they’re living in just one room,” she says. “Some people don’t have a car to get to the shops and public transport is expensive. You can’t count on someone having a freezer or even a fridge. Sometimes they’ve only got two rings to cook on, or just a microwave.” The situation for some people in Eastbourne, an elegant seaside town generally known as a desirable retirement destination for affluent pensioners, is becoming increasingly desperate, confirms Howard Wardle, founder and manager of Eastbourne Foodbank. “Counterintuitively, because overall it’s a wealthy town, there are poor services for those in most need,” he says. “I talked to a mum the other day. She’d been found rummaging in a bin for food – and collapsed. She was taken to hospital and diagnosed with malnutrition.” Hackney grimaces. “She’ll probably be worried about losing her children [to social services],” she says. Social workers and families have told me that it is standard for a welfare check to include social workers looking through parents’ fridges and kitchen cupboards. The three of us ponder the notion that poverty is making families terrified that local authorities will consider that the threshold of “significant harm” has been reached, and fear their children could be removed because there’s not enough food in the house. Wardle has just helped to launch a Poverty Commission in Eastbourne. “We’re going to look at fuel poverty, transport poverty, food poverty, education, find out where are the gaps, and how can we plug them, to stop this crazy business of food banks,” he says. “Because we want to close this food bank. I think it’s disgusting in the 21st century, to be banging out 10 tonnes of food a month, in a rich town.” The kitchen at the end of Batts’s living room is almost too small to turn around in. She does have a cooker and a fridge-freezer, but there’s barely any work surface on which to chop an onion let alone assemble ingredients. Undaunted, she’s done her best to follow the recipes. “Doing the three meals a day was the hardest thing, and getting into a routine,” she says. “I’ve not eaten breakfast since I was at primary school. It’s made me eat properly.” Nodding at her sleeping daughter whose eyes are starting to flutter open after her nap, she adds: “I only used to feed her.” Scarlette’s favourite recipes, it turns out, have been the bean burgers, the frittata and the blueberry porridge. “She’s good at trying things,” says Batts. The allocated £16 has been enough to feed them both, but four weeks into the plan, the lack of treats has been impossible to stick to. “Now and then I will add something like a takeaway, maybe once a month, or a tub of ice-cream,” she says, smiling embarrassedly. “I’m a little bit naughty. I do buy her treats.” The toddler is too young to grasp the financial choices her mother is having to navigate, or understand the effort required to feed her seven days a week on less money than some people spend on a top-up shop on the way home from work. And she can’t understand yet how the impossibility of finding a few spare quid for social activities that include eating out may impinge on her social life and friendships as she grows up. It doesn’t take long for those differences to become obvious though. Jacqui, 32, has also taken cookery classes with Community Stuff. Her kids are 11, eight and three, and have only known a life on benefits: Jacqui can’t get a job till her youngest is at school. She allocates £40 a week for food, and the children have started to notice they’re missing out. “My 11-year-old complains sometimes,” she says. “She’s been round her friends and says they’ve had treats and things. I just say there’s nothing I can do.” Does she think £40 a week is enough to feed a family of four? “Not really, to be honest. Because if I can’t get the reduced stuff, it’s just plain bland food. Pasta on its own.” Her children have learned, Jacqui says, that they can’t have treats. “Meat to them is a treat.” How does having to say “no” all the time make her feel? “I’d like to do a lot better for them but you can only do what you can do,” she says. Beneath her matter-of-fact tone, which speaks of years of coping, you can hear the hurt. In April 2019, the charity Child Poverty Action Group published Living Hand to Mouth, a piece of research that shone a spotlight on children’s experiences of food and eating in low-income families. When I was asked to write the foreword – following previous reporting looking at how poverty and hunger affects children’s ability to access education – it was the young people’s shame, guilt and sense of exclusion from normal, everyday activities that hit hardest. Bryony, aged 13, living with her mother and brother in a coastal town, told the researchers: “If there isn’t enough food, we’ll get it and sometimes Mum will go hungry… Even if it’s not that much food for [us], it’s enough that we’ve actually had something, whereas Mum hasn’t, and it gets a bit to the point where we’ll start feeling guilty because Mum hasn’t had anything and we’ve had it.” Some parents said they would often go hungry so their children could eat. But that isn’t always enough. Children whose parents have no recourse to public funds aren’t eligible for free school meals despite being destitute. Two brothers aged 14 and 15 whose mother was not allowed to work until her immigration status was resolved said they went hungry every day at school because their mum couldn’t put credit on their pre-payment dinner cards. One had so little energy, he explained, that “you end up falling asleep in the classroom and get in trouble for it”. Dr Rebecca O’Connell of University College London, who conducted some of the interviews, recalls a teacher who had been made redundant, with one child at university and one at home, telling her: “I’m sick of people talking about budgeting. There just isn’t enough money.” Why are children’s lives being blighted and their futures curtailed because they’re not getting what they need to eat? “No department of government is taking responsibility for people being hungry,” says Niall Cooper, director of Church Action on Poverty. He drily ticks off the list of departments he’s lobbied: the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department of Health, the Department for Education. They’ve all knocked him back. “The ability to afford a good diet isn’t a strategic priority for any of them, and departments are driven by their strategic aims,” he observes. It’s hardly surprising that the politicians have struggled with the stark truth that austerity has brought many of their constituents to the point where food banks are the only thing standing between a basic meal and not eating at all. Despite multiple reports of rising child poverty and growing inequality, the government has only just agreed to start collecting statistics on household food insecurity, defined as “limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods, or limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways (eg without resorting to emergency food supplies, scavenging, stealing or other coping strategies).” The numbers gathered this year will become the official baseline against which progress – or lack of it – can be measured. Back in Eastbourne, I meet Kath in the Tesco cafe. Now 41, she had to drop out of her nursing degree aged 20 following two years of study, after being diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a disabling genetic condition. She’s had to live on benefits ever since. As she eases herself onto a chair, it’s clear she’s in some pain. Kath is resourceful, organised and funny as hell as she rips into the empty cupboard plan, for which she was an early tester. “No snacks! If you go to the food bank you get a jar of jam or a packet of biscuits,” she teases Hackney, who grins back. “Maybe we can look at putting in a recipe for fruit crumble next time,” she murmurs. Kath isn’t mollified. “And a week of fish this, fish that – I don’t like fish!” Shopping done, we look in her trolley. What’s in it scarcely covers the bottom. The receipt says £14.10. An electrical storm has just broken Kath’s freezer. She can’t afford to get it mended so she won’t be able to freeze leftovers. The strictness of the discipline required to survive on a tiny budget for years is wearing, she explains – she regularly checks comparison sites for offers and has noticed prices going up. “There are times I wish I could just go and buy a cake,” she says. Does she ever? “Sometimes. But not often. Luxuries don’t often happen these days.” What’s a luxury? She laughs. “A chocolate bar. A packet of crisps. I’ve missed those. Especially if you’ve had a bad month, it’s a mood lifter.” Except for Christmas, she’s not bought alcohol for five years. “There’s no point in drinking. Not that I wouldn’t enjoy being able to have a glass of wine. I stopped because of the cost.” Then Kath says something that leaves me speechless. “I drink tea, and as a luxury I’ll buy PG Tips or Tetley. Otherwise,” she pulls a face, “it’s shop’s own brand.” On her benefits, Kath says she can only afford £20 a week on food. “I could probably up it but the cats have to be fed.” How many does she have, I ask. “Seven” she says. Involuntarily, my eyebrows jump. Kath looks at me steadily. “They’re rescues.” She couldn’t let them starve. She spends about a tenner a week feeding her cats. It is, she says, her choice. And the cats are a comfort. “They’re company. You’re never alone when you’ve got cats,” she says. “They bring calmness when I’m stressed.” Enduring a chronic illness on a very low income is clearly tough. “I’m basically fine,” she says reassuringly. But there have been times she’s had to use the food bank, when her money’s run out. Emergency food parcels can only address the symptoms, not the causes, of food poverty. The End Hunger UK coalition of charities, faith groups, academics and frontline organisations has just launched a campaign calling on government to halve household food insecurity by 2025, as a benchmark on the way to eradicating it by 2030. This is one of the sustainable development goals, adopted by the UN, that the UK signed up to in 2015. It will not be achieved by doling out emergency food parcels. It will only happen, says Cooper, if government decides to address the underlying causes of poverty and destitution. He means wages not being enough. Benefits not being enough. The money people have to exist on just… not being enough. “Part of the long-term vision is that people should be able to buy food for themselves,” he says. “That has to be core to solving the problem.” At the Eastbourne food-bank depot, a warehouse on an industrial estate, Wardle points me to a graph showing that the number of parcels given out has almost doubled in the last year. But donations from the public have dropped, so he’s had to buy in extra supplies. He’s reliant on what people drop in collection bins and he’s 10 tonnes down on what he needs, so he’s worried. Can he ask the supermarkets for more? “They have never given us anything apart from their chuck-out stuff, when their shelving plan changes,” he says acidly. Some are “brilliant at giving us things nobody wants to eat. Anchovies. Duck pâté,” he adds. He points at huge tins of artichokes and olives. “I don’t know what to do with it.” Hackney says she’ll take some of the catering-sized tins off his hands for her cookery classes. She and Morris have launched a new food skills course which works in tandem with their book, and will be training grassroots organisations around the UK to deliver it to anyone needing help to feed themselves on a limited income. “Living on a tight budget, in the long term it’s crippling because you feel trapped,” says Hackney. “But if you have practical cooking skills and some organisation in the way you plan your finances, you gain some limited sense of control. If you have virtually no money, you can’t make mistakes. Otherwise you end up hungry.” Some names have been changed",Food; Food poverty; Food banks; Social exclusion; Society; Life and style,Food
2018-01-23T18:25:42Z,"'Blended' finance is key to achieving global sustainability goals, says report",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/23/blended-finance-is-key-to-achieving-global-sustainability-goals-says-report,"Tackling climate change and achieving the world’s sustainable development goals will require publicly funded and private sector banks and institutions to be far more willing to join forces to provide “blended” finance to projects, according to a new study. Blended finance is the term given to the use of public or philanthropic capital to spur private sector investment in projects aimed at achieving the sustainable development goals. Already, this market is worth about $50bn globally, but experts said on Tuesday this sum could double within the next three to four years. In a report to be presented on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the Business and Sustainable Development Commission found that private sector investors could take advantage of blended finance to gain access to rapidly growing markets in the developing world. The commission has set up a taskforce specifically to consider blended finance and how to encourage growth in the sector. In its report, the taskforce found that there was great fragmentation across the market and called for public and private investors to pool their resources to create more giant funds, worth more than £1bn each, to take over from the smaller funds, of about $100m in size, which currently dominate the blended finance landscape. There would still be a place for smaller funds, the taskforce said, but the creation of very large finance vehicles would facilitate bigger projects than are currently possible. Lord Malloch-Brown, the former UK diplomat who chairs the commission, said: “Action is needed end-to-end across the whole investment system to scale up the use of blended finance, if we are serious about closing the funding gap for the sustainable development goals.” He said gaining more private capital would be essential to achieving the sustainable development goals, especially regarding infrastructure in emerging economies. The commission found that the market for blended finance had already doubled in size in the last five years, and that countries in the developing world wishing to take advantage of the funds available should prioritise investment in infrastructure that would increase resilience to climate change and provide environmentally sound economic development. The group estimated that about $6tn a year would be needed to meet the sustainable development goals fully, and that a large proportion of this could be met by blended finance, if the market for the latter is spurred on by governments and companies. Jeremy Oppenheim, founder of Systemiq, a financial institution focusing on sustainable development, and programme director at the Business and Sustainable Development Commission, said private sector banks and other financial institutions could benefit by pooling their resources with organisations from the public sector, such as development banks. “There is a window of opportunity for institutional investors to increase their exposure to emerging markets infrastructure by taking advantage of the risk mitigation offered by blended finance,” said Oppenheim. “Momentum is growing – it is possible that the blended finance market could double again in the next three to four years.” The paper produced by the taskforce, entitled Better Finance, Better World, is now open to consultation, which will be completed by the middle of March. After that, a report taking the responses to the consultation into account will be produced at the April meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. The Business and Sustainable Development Commission was set up to further the sustainable development goals, and is funded by public sector organisations including the UN and World Bank, philanthropic bodies such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and private sector companies including Unilever. The sustainable development goals were adopted in 2015 by the UN, and include goals on ending poverty, protecting the planet and its resources, and ensure the long-term prosperity of humanity. All of the goals included in the package are supposed to be met by 2030.",Sustainable development; Sustainable development goals; Climate crisis; Environment; World news; Green economy,Environment
2020-02-09T11:00:04Z,‘We all deserve representation': hijab-wearing model Halima Aden on the power of fashion,https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/feb/09/halima-aden-model-activist-hijab-refugee-fashion-we-all-deserve-representation,"Halima Aden, then aged 19, became the first contestant in the Miss USA 2016 beauty pageant to wear a hijab and burkini, attracting the attention of French fashion legend Carine Roitfeld. The following year she became the first hijab-wearing model to sign with a global modelling agency, IMG, and then the first to walk at New York fashion week, for Yeezy, the Kanye West brand. She later became the first hijab-wearing model to make the cover of Vogue – twice (first Vogue Arabia, then British Vogue) – and soon afterwards a Sports Illustrated swimsuit shoot followed. By that point she’d already become a Unicef ambassador, and a go-to voice on diversity in the fashion industry. In 2017 she gave the first TED talk at a refugee camp in Kakuma, Kenya. Teen Vogue went with her. When we meet, at a hotel near King’s Cross, I ask if it ever gets tiring, being the first in so many different ways, shouldering the burden of representation. “Somebody needs to,” Aden says. “I want my sister, my little nieces, even my nephews to see representations of somebody who wears a hijab in modern ways, in such a way that they can relate to.” We’re sitting side by side on a window seat, Aden holding court before a little audience of PRs, management and her best friend, Lizeth, who has travelled with her from the US. Though she looks very much the high-fashion figure, all in black – sequins and brocade lace, knee-high stiletto boots – she seems younger than her 22 years, gabbing away in the stream-of-conscious slang and asides of a teenager still starstruck by the turns her life has taken. But on the topics of diversity, representation and sustainability, she speaks with passion and conviction. She has said in the past that, growing up in the US: “The only times I saw somebody dressed like me was on CNN – and they weren’t doing anything I approve of.” “I feel like we all deserve representation and I didn’t have that,” Aden says now. “I never got to flip through a magazine and see somebody who looks like me.” Lizeth digs out the latest issue of Essence magazine, Aden proud in pink on the cover. Aden takes it from her, somewhat wonderingly. “Sometimes it’s so wild for me,” she says. “I still catch myself… When my friend went and got that from the newsstand, I was like: ‘Oh my God.’” The fact she has been able to have a global career in fashion at all is proof that the industry is increasingly open to diversity. Aden is 5ft 5in, petite for a model, and a resident of Minnesota, far from the industry capitals of New York, London, Paris or Milan. “And the fact that I’m able to do runway, the fact that I have graced these magazine covers and wear a hijab on top of that, be who I am, have my identity, wear it proudly… I think fashion is doing a beautiful job.” Aden now has her own 47-piece hijab collection, Halima x Modanisa, and her hijab is stipulated as non-negotiable in her contract with IMG. “It’s a big part of my identity,” she says. “It’s not because I don’t think people are going to listen – it’s more so they know what to expect. I always bring extras – my own set of turbans, turtlenecks, tights – because it’s a collaboration. I also recognise that for a lot of people, in my first year especially, I was the only hijab-wearing girl they’d worked with. So they’re not going to necessarily know 100% what to expect, just like I didn’t know what to expect with fashion, because it’s not the world that I come from.” She does have certain requirements, such as a pop-up tent in which to change backstage at shows, but she says she’s never been uncomfortably set apart, or made to feel othered. She remembers her experience of walking for Yeezy at New York fashion week in 2017, her breakout year, as a watershed moment. The first outfit she was presented with “was just not going to work,” she says, gesturing above her knee – too short. “Even then I knew: walking away when something doesn’t fit is always better than feeling you need to force something.” She returned to her hotel, disappointed but resolute. “And then, without having to say anything, they called back: ‘We have a second option.’ I tried it on and it was perfect. I just knew it was a pivotal moment in my life. The people who you want to work with, they’re willing to work with you just the way you are.” That same year, Aden remembers walking for MaxMara at Milan fashion week in a look that had been designed with her in mind. When she posted it on Instagram, a woman commented: “He keeps you in mind, he keeps us in mind. Now this Muslim shopper will keep MaxMara in mind.” Aden shared it with the brand. “I was like – wink-wink-wink!” It led to an exclusive capsule collection in the Middle East, for which Aden was the face. “It’s a win for designers when they’re diverse; it’s a win for the brand, it’s a win for everybody – we all want to see a little piece of ourselves reflecting back.” And it makes a difference, she says. The year after Aden became the first contestant to wear a hijab in Miss USA, there were seven others. Last year she was one of two hijabi models on the MaxMara catwalk in Milan, and one of three for her second Vogue Arabia cover. When Aden was seven, she used to pray for rain – the kind of torrential rain that would wash away her new home in the American Midwest. “I remember thinking: ‘Then our neighbours could come out and play,’” she says. Even the structure of her apartment building felt alienating. “I was like, ‘God, everybody is so isolated.’” Aden was born a refugee in the United Nations Kakuma camp in northwestern Kenya, where her mother had fled the Somali civil war in 1994. There their house was made of mud, scraps, sticks – anything her mother could find. “It would be normal for me to go to nursery school, come back and find it had washed away,” she says. But then the community would come together to rebuild it, “and then it’s the kids’ time to play around.” The model remembers her childhood in the camp as being joyful and supportive. “There’s no walls keeping you apart from your neighbour,” she says. In her new home in Missouri, where she was relocated with her family in 2004, before moving to Minnesota, where they live today, the barriers stood strong. “Kakuma” translates from Swahili as “middle of nowhere”. “Sometimes, when I’m like, ‘I was born in the middle of nowhere,’ people think I’m joking,” Aden says. “But if you actually look at Google Maps…” People tend to think of a refugee camp as being a temporary settlement. But Kakuma is “more of a city of its own,” says Aden, in both permanence and size. Established by the UN in 1992 with a 70,000-person capacity, it has since ballooned to about 192,000 registered refugees and asylum seekers, the vast majority of whom are never resettled (the global figure is less than 1%). As a child, Aden remembers thriving under the collective care of the community, which was two thirds women and children. She was bright – she spoke Somali and Swahili, sometimes translating for the grown-ups – and popular, roaming the camp with up to 30 playmates of mixed ages and ethnicities. (“If you could keep up, you were in the group.”) Aden is well aware that her happy stories of childhood challenge the stereotype of the “tragic refugee”, though she credits her mother with working hard to shield her young family from hardship. Aden never knew her father. He was lost during the Somali civil war, and assumed dead by her mother; he made contact after they had moved to the US, but died before Aden could develop a relationship. “It was both the scars and the smiles,” she says. “It was a happy childhood and also, we lived in uncertainty.” Symbolic of this limbo was a noticeboard that was updated with the names and destinations of those lucky few bound for resettlement. Aden remembers it as larger than life, “like something out of The Hunger Games”: “It would control your entire future – it was literally the difference between life and death. For parents it meant a brand new life: ‘We’re starting over, we won the lottery.’ But for the kids it is: ‘I’m never seeing my friends again’.” Another common misconception of being a refugee, Aden says, “is that you get a say where you go”. Her family were relocated to a poverty-stricken, crime-rife neighbourhood in St Louis, Missouri, which – compared to the “nurturing” community of Kakuma – came as a shock. That was when she felt most isolated, when she wished for her house to wash away. It was the first time she’d heard gunshots. “But nonetheless, did I have the fear of malaria? No – so, in a way, it was like trading one obstacle for another.” The biggest hurdle was learning English: Aden’s school in St Louis did not have an English language programme. After two weeks of presenteeism, Aden recalls her mother asking her to read some written English aloud. “I literally started mouthing the words to Dilemma” – rapper Nelly and Kelly Rowland’s syrupy duet, which she knew from the radio. Aden mimics a haltering recital: “‘No matt-er. Whatido. All I think about. Is you’ – I just couldn’t stand the idea of disappointing her.” Eventually Aden’s mother decided to relocate the family to St Cloud, Minnesota, where they found a community like the one that they had left at the camp. At first they were heavily reliant on it, living on food stamps and even, for six months, in a women’s shelter. Aden remembers the kindness of neighbours, taking the family to the grocery store during the punishing winters, giving her mother lifts when she couldn’t drive. “It’s why I’m so loyal,” she says. “I love my state.” She lives in St Paul now, closer to the airport, but only 40 minutes from her mother, who’s still in St Cloud. Minnesota is known for high taxes, but Aden says she is happy to pay them. “I relied on welfare when I was little... I think of it as my way of paying back.” Before we meet, Aden’s team is adamant that I don’t ask her about Trump or US politics, so instead I ask her how superficial diversity in fashion tallies with a more fractious, divided world. “I don’t even really avoid politics,” she says, “but it’s not something that I’ve needed in order to connect with people. Once I share my story, there’s always some common ground. It doesn’t have to be: ‘I grew up in a refugee camp.’ I get just as many messages, believe it or not, from parents who are not Muslim, who are not black, who say, ‘Thank you for making modesty look cool and young’.” When she entered the Miss Minnesota USA pageant in 2016, as a freshman at St Cloud State University, Aden told local media that she wanted to represent Muslim women and counter the image that they were oppressed. “The hijab is a symbol we wear on our heads,” she said. “But I want people to know that it is my choice.” Today she says her motivations for entering were less lofty. “College tuition is expensive in the States, muuuuuucho expensive!” And the top 15 at the pageant were offered scholarships. Did Aden think she’d win? “No, God, no.” She laughs. “But top 15? I was like, ‘I think I could do that’.” Aden’s mother was strongly against her entering the pageant, arguing it would distract from her studies, and that the two-piece burkini was too skimpy. Though they have since been able to find common ground through her advocacy and work with Unicef, it can feel like they are from two different cultures sometimes. She didn’t tell her mum about the Sports Illustrated shoot “until it hit newsstands”. She was also criticised by members of the Muslim community who saw modelling as haram – forbidden by Islamic law. “It was scary to put myself out there, because I didn’t know if I would get backlash, or how bad it was going to be,” she says. Two days before the pageant, Aden almost pulled out. But as she told the newspaper at the time: “You don’t let being the first to do it stop you.” She ended up making the semi-finals, “braces and all. And then IMG came calling – like, ‘Well, well, well… maybe I don’t need school.’” She leans back, for a second jokily triumphant – then seems to feel a chill coming in from across the Atlantic. “I’m kidding. Sorry, Mom!” The global spotlight on Aden caught the eye of Carine Roitfeld, who flew her to New York to shoot the cover of CR Fashion Book with Gigi Hadid, Paris Jackson and legendary photographer Mario Sorrenti. Aden agonised about asking for a selfie with Gigi (“So cringy,” she says now). As for Sorrenti, though, she had to Google her later. His direction to her was, “Give me sexy”, she seems a little abashed to say. “I didn’t know fashion lingo, I didn’t know photographers. I’m a Minnesota girl – very small town.” Even after signing with IMG, she watched all of Tyra Banks’s outlandish reality series America’s Next Top Model “to practise”. Seven months into her modelling career, she was still working part-time as a housekeeper in St Cloud. But rather than asking Aden to change, fashion’s royalty has made room for her as she is. Last week she was back in Kenya for a shoot and “I was just thinking, how crazy is it that, in one lifetime, I’ve gotten to experience both extremes.” Aden says she does not feel angry about the inequality she has seen – partly because she does not find it to be productive. “It’s like when I say: ‘We don’t want your pity.’ Let’s talk about solutions, invite refugees to the table. They’re part of the conversation – no policies should be enacted without their say.” Though she rules out a career in politics (“for now”), in the future she hopes to return to Kakuma with Unicef to inspire hope within the camp for a new life beyond it. “I couldn’t tell you what that would have meant to me as a six or seven-year-old – like, ‘Wait, there’s a life outside these walls?’ Hopefully, it’s not going to be so rare to see kids from the camps grow up and become teachers, lawmakers, presidents and CEOs of Fortune 500 companies. There’s talent everywhere.” For now Aden is pursuing opportunities in “fashion activism”. This month she was announced as the new face of the British accessories brand Bottletop, which was ahead of its time in positioning itself as “sustainable luxury” in 2002. Its handbags and clutches, which are made from sustainable leather and upcycled metal ring pulls, help to alleviate poverty in Brazil, Nepal and Kenya. Aden is optimistic in general, but particularly about the potential for consumer choice to be a force for positive change: “I think we’re at a place where people want to support brands and organisations they know are giving back.” She is also an ambassador for Bottletop’s #Togetherband campaign, which is tasked with raising awareness of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. Aden is probably one of the few celebrities who can “relate personally” to all 17 of them. She has been assigned the eighth goal: “Decent work and economic growth.” The fact that the Swiss multinational bank UBS is a founding partner seems to suggest which way the wind is blowing. “My career in fashion is not just, ‘I want to work with this brand, I want to get on that catwalk’ – we’re not sitting here talking about ‘Buy this heel, because this heel will make you feel sexy.’” She kicks up her stiletto boot, knee-high in black patent leather (admittedly very sexy). “I’m proud that I can say I combined fashion and activism. I can’t do one without the other.” Aden sees that her story, from refugee camp to the cover of Vogue, is an unusual one. But she has had to navigate it herself – down to mentioning, at her very first meeting with IMG as a teenager in New York, that she would like to work with Unicef. “I had to learn, in the beginning especially, that maybe I’d never find another model who I could relate to. But I’m making my own path, and it works perfectly for me.” Fashion editor Jo Jones; photographer’s assistant Dan Ross; fashion assistant Lena Young; makeup by Dina at Frank Agency using Dior Forever and Dior Capture Totale C.E.L.L.

2018-12-14T18:27:07Z,A youth activist on the climate crisis: politicians won't save us | Victoria Barrett,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/dec/14/climate-change-young-people-cop24-conference,"As wildfires burn, as temperatures rise, as the last remaining old-growth forests in Poland are logged, world leaders are in Katowice to negotiate the implementation of the Paris climate agreement. To outsiders, UN climate talks may seem like a positive step. Unfortunately, this is COP24. For 24 years, world leaders have annually talked at each other instead of to one another in hopes of reaching an agreement on how to mitigate the climate crisis. In all that time, they have barely scratched the surface of an issue that the world’s top climate scientists say we now have 12 years to stop – and that is an optimistic estimate. There’s an urgency in my heart being here in Katowice, knowing that this negotiation process is supposed to protect my generation and ones thereafter. I am afraid of the lack of accountability in the space, knowing that the people with power will be patted on the back for simply coming together without making meaningful policy commitments. When the news stories come out about successful negotiations, we forget about when leaders pushed to leave “human rights” out of policy wording, or stood on the floor advocating for fossil fuels as a solution (hint: they’re not), all to placate to their own interest in power and maintaining it. They are voluntarily blind to the suffering their decisions cause. Homes will be lost, families will be torn apart by displacement and at borders, and the sea will encroach upon whole societies, exterminating cultures and livelihoods. Developed countries like the US, corrupted by fossil fuel interests, are to blame. UN negotiators have been trying to solve the climate crisis since before I was born. When will global leaders admit that this is a broken and dysfunctional charade instead of burying the reality under false solutions and jargon? What will be the catalyst for people in power to do what is right? Do millions of people have to be displaced? Do we have to be stealing a livable planet from people not even born yet? How many millions of people will have to die from climate damage such as drought, famine, superstorms and wildfires before world leaders commit to implementing real solutions to defeat this crisis? I’ve been doing this work for five years and have given up a lot to do the things I know are right. I’ve given up personal finances, friendships, a normal adolescence and more to get up on the global stage. I’ve taken breaks from school, failed a few classes. Youth activists everywhere make personal sacrifices every day in order to protect the world we’ll inherit and our governments can’t do the same for us. The institutions meant to protect me don’t seem to care as much as I do and it’s a burden I carry everyday. I watch my government and governments around the world trade my future for profit. A future my mother fought hard to secure through sacrifice, when she made the journey to immigrate to the United States. There’s a lot of anger and depression inside of me because of this, but I found happiness and reward in seeing the solutions, power and love in the climate movement. Though political institutions have fallen short, being on the ground here does offer hope: it proves the strength of people power. Politicians will never be the core of this movement. We need to highlight and uplift genuine grassroots movements that properly address the lived experiences of the people they protect. We need to turn our attention and our energy into communities that are helping themselves in the best ways that they can. The marginalized communities on the frontlines know what it actually means to sacrifice in order to uphold future generations and young people. They understand giving up their own comforts to protect lives. We have called on our political leaders to demonstrate a similar understanding. But resilience can’t be taught, and it doesn’t come from a president, minister or monarch: it comes from the adversity you have faced. This is why, to fight the powers that hand away pieces of our environment for profit, we must enlist the people who have lived on the margins of society. People power will always be stronger than the people in power. Victoria Barrett is one of the 21 plaintiffs, aged 10 to 21, in the high-profile Juliana v the United States lawsuit, which faulted the US government for failing to protect its citizens from climate change.

2018-10-17T11:20:56Z,Merkel calls for international unity in the face of global health threats,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/oct/17/merkel-calls-for-international-unity-world-health-summit,"Angela Merkel has urged countries to work together in the fight against global health threats, warning that disease and epidemics are security risks that do not respect national borders. Addressing international health experts in Berlin, the German chancellor acknowledged that global cooperation was under pressure, but said nations cannot ignore health challenges. “We all know about the devastating consequences, particularly of communicable diseases, first and foremost on individuals, but also on economies,” said Merkel. “Disease and epidemics do not stop at borders, they do not only put individual health systems to the test, they can also jeopardise the security and development of whole regions,” she told a joint meeting held by the World Health Summit and Grand Challenges, a health research initiative, on Tuesday. “It is absolutely clear that global issues require global responses, from the richer countries but also from those that are less prosperous.” The 2014 Ebola crisis in west Africa was a wake-up call, said Merkel, adding that neither national nor international systems were prepared to cope with the spread of the disease. Her speech came amid warnings that the international community is poorly equipped to deal with future epidemics and unlikely to meet the 2030 deadline for health targets set out in the sustainable development goals. While agencies had responded more quickly to the most recent Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the health community would not be able to cope with more rapidly spreading diseases, said Tedros Adhanom, director general of the World Health Organization. “God forbid, if we have a very potent airborne disease, it could be influenza,” he told delegates. “We are not ready. We are as strong as our weakest link, and there is a lot of vulnerability. “If there is no health security it can trigger political, economic and social upheaval on a global scale.” Adhanom warned that the international community must collaborate effectively to reach health targets, adding that existing efforts are off track across a range of areas. “At the current rate we will miss the targets on maternal, child and neonatal mortality, we will miss the targets on HIV, TB and malaria. We will miss the targets on family planning and child stunting, universal health coverage and more. “Fragmentation, duplication and inefficiency are undermining progress,” he said. “We must do something differently.” Tedros welcomed a commitment by 11 leading international organisations to develop a joint plan that aims to speed up progress on the 2030 agenda. The partnership will include organisations such as the World Bank, the UN’s children’s agency Unicef, and Gavi, the international vaccine alliance. Merkel, who called for the initiative jointly with the Ghanaian president Nana Akufo-Addo and Erina Solberg, the prime minister of Norway, said greater collaboration was needed. “The principle of multilateralism has been put to the test for quite some time now and is under pressure,” she said. “Multilateralism creates win-win situations for each and every one of us.” Germany will also invest €500m into antimicrobial resistance, a major global health concern that threatens the effective prevention and treatment of an increasing range of infections. “We have to contain resistances against antibiotics because we cannot simply hope researchers will come up with new ideas on antibiotics all the time,” said Merkel.",Global health; Angela Merkel; Germany; World news; Global development; Ebola; Health; Society; Sustainable development goals; World Health Organization,Global development
2018-10-03T11:29:59Z,The Thailand cave rescue points the way to a more unified global future,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/oct/03/lets-harness-the-unity-of-the-thai-cave-rescue-to-achieve-global-goals,"On Friday, the curtain fell on the UN general assembly in New York. Attended by many of the world’s leaders, the gathering addressed delegates in high-level general debates on how best to improve our world. One debate was entitled: “Making the UN relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies.” Months earlier, an incident germane to this theme played out in northern Thailand, where members of the Wild Boars football team became trapped in a cave. It is a story that demonstrated nations united and responsibilities shared in the face of adversity and incredible odds; an instructive lesson in the power of unity, a quality we often take for granted despite its important contribution to peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. Barely a sliver of humanity had heard about the team – a clutch of boys aged between 11 and 16 – before June of this year, when their coach led them into the Tham Luang cave complex on a team-building exercise that went terribly wrong. They became trapped amid rising flood waters, forcing them to survive without food for nearly a week. Their dramatic, week-long rescue gripped millions of people around the world and was dubbed by many as a miracle. But what made it possible? The actions of many. Under the leadership of the Thai government, divers, police, army, navy and airforce came together with hundreds of volunteers and experts from countries across the globe to conduct the rescue. A diver from the tiny neighbouring nation of Laos was one of the first to help and stayed engaged in the rescue effort every single day. There were daily stories that spoke of responsibilities shared in an effort to save the boys. The determination of so many to ensure that no one was left behind was staggering. “Leave no one behind” is the key message of the UN as it tries to bring prosperity to people worldwide through the sustainable development goals. The same message became the enduring theme of the cave boys rescue operation. From news reports, we now know that the 25-year-old coach – despite a huge error in judgement – cared steadfastly for the boys. He counselled them, shared his food, and practised meditation with them to keep their spirits strong. He wanted to ensure their safety; he wanted to leave no one behind. Outside the cave, international divers joined forces with Thailand’s elite teams, plotting strategies and working in the face of tremendous odds. They too wanted to leave no one behind but, in the process, sadly lost one of their own. This force of unity for a team of boys from marginalised communities is testimony to what we can do when we collaborate. Some of the boys were not Thai citizens, but now the Thai government is providing them with citizenship. The Wild Boars team provided us with an abiding lesson in the power of shared responsibility. As their story shows, there is no stronger force to bring about a better world. If we can harness this unity for the sustainable development agenda, we will have peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies, and no one will be left behind. • Haoliang Xu is UN assistant secretary general and director of the UN Development Programme’s regional bureau for Asia and the Pacific",Global development; United Nations; Thailand cave rescue; Sustainable development goals,Global development
2019-01-20T11:47:53Z,Action not words needed over biggest public health failure of our time: pneumonia | Larry Elliott,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/20/action-not-words-needed-over-biggest-public-health-failure-of-our-time-pneumonia-davos-2019,"Davos this year will be like Hamlet without the prince. Donald Trump was all set to be the star of the show for the second year running but has decided that giving a keynote address to a hall full of billionaires is politically problematical at a time when the US government is shut down. Emmanuel Macron is giving the World Economic Forum a miss for similar reasons. If you have been dubbed the president of the rich the last place you want to be seen is at the annual gathering of the 1%. Theresa May has also decided she has better things to do with her time. But even without Trump, Macron and May, there will be plenty for the global elite to talk about. The World Economic Forum, the body that has organised the event since 1971, says this week should all be about setting a course for Globalisation 4.0. Without doubt, there is room for improvement on Globalisation 3.0, the model that has crashed and burned over the past decade. But it is a bit of a stretch to imagine that the Davos regulars are the ones to do the job. These are the people, after all, who lionised financial liberalisation, snaffled most of the proceeds of growth, salted their money away in tax havens and pressed for tax cuts for themselves while insisting on austerity for the poor. It is not hard to specify the problems. This year’s Davos comes at a time when global growth is slowing and political discontent is growing; when global problems such as climate change are becoming more pressing and yet the global cooperation needed to deal with them is at its weakest since the 1930s. The attendees at the WEF get all that. There will be plenty of talk in the conference hall and at the after-dark cocktail parties about how “something must be done” about inequality and how the economic benefits of the robot age must be shared by all. What there won’t be, at least on past form, is any action to back up the rhetoric. There is a complete disconnect between these problem-solvers and the real-world challenges they consistently fail to tackle. Let’s take one example: the battle (or, more accurately, the non-battle) against pneumonia, which is the biggest public health failure of our time. Pneumonia attracts little attention, in large part because it is assumed to be a condition that kills old people. That’s true in the west but in the developing world pneumonia is the biggest killer of children going. In 2016, it cost the lives of an estimated 880,000 children – more than for malaria and diarrhoea combined. Most of them were less than two years old. Nor is tackling pneumonia difficult or expensive. As Kevin Watkins, the chief executive of the charity Save the Children, wrote in a recent article for the Lancet: “Almost all pneumonia deaths could be prevented through vaccination or early diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics costing less than 50 US cents.” Why is there no outrage at the idea that somewhere in the world a child is dying every two minutes from something that could be easily and cheaply treated? Where are the international initiatives? Where is the coalition of rock stars, billionaire philanthropists and politicians announcing at Davos a major drive to eradicate pneumonia? The answer is that it is nowhere to be seen, despite the fact that on current trends by 2030 – the target date under the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs) for ending preventable child deaths – 750,000 children a year will still be dying of pneumonia. In part, the painfully slow progress in eradicating childhood pneumonia reflects the failure to make tackling inequality central to achieving the SDGs. There is no real point in setting ambitious targets for health unless health systems are designed and funded to cater for the most marginalised people in developing countries. Poverty and pneumonia are inextricably linked. The children most at risk are invariably from the poorest families in rural regions and urban slums. They are the most likely to be malnourished and the least likely to be immunised, diagnosed and treated. What’s more, pneumonia is confined to the poor. Unlike measles, cholera or HIV/Aids, it does not readily cross social boundaries, which means that the children of those with the loudest political voices in developing countries don’t suffer from it. Health priorities are set by those with different priorities. That goes for the international community as well. If pneumonia could be transmitted across borders like, say, Ebola, western donor countries would take it a lot more seriously than they do. “Pneumonia,” Watkins says, “is a disease that can be contained in poor communities of poor countries – and this is a prescription for policy inertia.” There is one final reason pneumonia remains the world’s Cinderella disease: treating it requires long-term investment in healthcare systems skewed towards poor communities. That means trained doctors and nurses that can spot the symptoms early and have the necessary resources to respond. Insecticide-treated bed nets have helped in the fight against malaria but no magic bullet exists in the battle against pneumonia. Instead, what is required is action at all levels: higher spending on health in developing countries; specific action plans to tackle pneumonia and international initiatives to increase supplies of cheap drugs. Doubtless, there will be much hand-wringing this week about the importance of international cooperation in creating a new and better globalisation. The willingness to tackle pneumonia is a test of that commitment because it requires a global partnership, the transfer of resources and an eagerness to put the interests of the poorest and most vulnerable first. Above all, it requires a willingness to act, not only talk.",Davos; Economics; Business; Europe; World news; Health; Davos 2019,Business
2018-09-24T23:01:07Z,UK grocers pledge to halve food waste from 'farm to fork' by 2030,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/25/uk-grocers-pledge-halve-food-waste-supermarkets,"Large supermarkets and manufacturers are signing up to efforts to drive down the UK’s annual £20bn food waste bill by committing to halving waste from “farm to fork” by 2030. A roadmap being published on Tuesday by the government’s waste reduction body, Wrap, and the food and grocery charity IGD sets a series of milestones for businesses to reduce waste at every stage of the supply chain. The annual bill is equivalent to more than £300 per UK citizen. The voluntary scheme aims to ensure the UK meets the UN’s sustainable development target (specifically target 12.3) of halving per capita global food waste at retail and consumer level and through production and supply chains by 2030. The UN estimates global food waste causes about $940bn (£770bn) a year in economic losses. It says a third of the world’s food is wasted while one in nine people remain malnourished. By September 2019, the roadmap aims to have all major UK retailers and half of other large producers and suppliers measuring, reporting and acting on food waste. By 2026, all large food businesses should have a target to cut waste from their operations. Supermarkets have been criticised for contributing to the UK’s food waste mountain by sticking rigidly to quality specifications and routinely rejecting mis-shapen, but edible, produce grown by suppliers. They have also been urged to do more to redistribute edible items to the needy via food banks and charities. Eighty-nine early signatories, including the UK’s biggest supermarkets as well as food producers, manufacturers and restaurant chains, have committed to the plan. They include Britain’s largest retailer, Tesco, which will announce on Tuesday that 27 of its biggest suppliers, as well as Booker, which Tesco merged with this year, will publish data on food waste for the first time. Ten of Tesco’s branded suppliers including Coca-Cola, Mars, Nestlé and Unilever will also commit to the project within the next 12 months. Addressing a New York event organised by Champions 12.3, a coalition of governments, businesses and international organisations committed to accelerating progress toward the 12.3 goal, its chair, the Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis, will say: “Every year, a third of the world’s food goes to waste – that’s the equivalent of 1.3bn tonnes of food being thrown away – and we think that’s simply not right. We believe that what gets measured gets managed.” Tesco became the first UK retailer to publish the amount of food wasted in its operations in 2013. It is now more than 70% towards its target that no food that is safe for human consumption goes to waste. Tackling food waste in the home is more complex. This year, Sainsbury’s abandoned a multimillion-pound project to halve food waste in a designated town, Swadlincote in south Derbyshire, after a year-long trial produced disappointing results. The retailer had planned to spend £10m over five years to develop a network of similar schemes across the UK. Clare Oxborrow, a senior food and farming campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “All companies along the supply chain should publicise their food waste data and commit to concerted long-term action, so that food waste is halved by 2030, as set out in the sustainable development goals.”",Food waste; Environment; Politics; Supermarkets; Retail industry; Business; UK news; J Sainsbury; Tesco; Food poverty; Food banks; Consumer affairs; Money; Poverty; Social exclusion; Society; Household bills; Sustainable development goals; Global development; United Nations; World news,Environment
2018-10-27T05:00:13Z,Air pollution is the new tobacco. Time to tackle this epidemic,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/27/air-pollution-is-the-new-tobacco-time-to-tackle-this-epidemic,"Air pollution is a silent public health emergency, killing 7 million people every year and damaging the health of many, many more. Despite this epidemic of needless, preventable deaths and disability, a smog of complacency pervades the planet. This is a defining moment and we must scale up action to urgently respond to this challenge. Air pollution puts the health of billions at risk from the simple act of breathing. The World Health Organization estimates nine in 10 people globally breathe polluted, toxic air. Air pollution is a health risk at every stage of life. Exposure to air pollution during pregnancy can damage a developing baby’s vital organs including the brain, heart and lungs and lead to a range of conditions including asthma, heart disease and cancers. Air pollution also negatively affects brain development during childhood, lowering children’s chances of success in school and employment possibilities later in life. The WHO’s latest estimates show that air pollution is responsible for one-quarter to one-third of deaths from heart attack, stroke, lung cancer and chronic respiratory disease. No one, rich or poor, can escape air pollution. A clean and healthy environment is the single most important precondition for ensuring good health. By cleaning up the air we breathe, we can prevent or at least reduce some of the greatest health risks. Although air pollution is getting worse in many parts of the world, this is not an inevitable march toward disaster. There is much that we can do to improve air quality, but we must all play our part. No person, group, city, country or region can solve the problem alone. We need strong commitments and actions from everyone: government decision-makers, community leaders, mayors, civil society, the private sector and even the individual. It will take time and endurance but we all have a critical role to play. The WHO is already taking on the battle. We are empowering health professionals not only to explain the risks of air pollution to their patients and how best to reduce those risks, but to give them the skills and evidence to advocate for health in policy decisions impacting air quality and public health. Through global commitments such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris climate accord and the Urban Agenda 2030, the WHO is building alliances with partners working in energy, climate and environment. We are using the “health argument” to bring different players in transport, urban planning, housing, energy and environment to the table and giving them the tools, resources and support to evaluate the health impacts of their policy decisions. The WHO also supports the health sector to “walk the talk” on air pollution and health. Inefficient energy use in hospitals and other healthcare facilities contributes to air pollution but is also a barrier to providing even the most basic health services and ultimately universal healthcare. The WHO is working with partners in the energy sector to understand the power needs of essential medical services, and to help drive innovation in clean and renewable energy power for healthcare delivery. Despite the overwhelming evidence, political action is still urgently needed to boost investments and speed up action to reduce air pollution. I am excited and honoured that, in less than a week, the WHO will host the first global conference on air pollution and health, where leaders will chart next steps for future action to cut air pollution in their countries. The conference will include a high-level “action day” at which we expect ministers, mayors, heads of intergovernmental organisations and others to make commitments to reduce air pollution and its impact on health. This will include measures like strengthening standards and legislation on air quality, improving assessment of the effects of pollution, enhancing global leadership and advocacy, ensuring access to clean energy and increasing investments in low-emissions technologies, as well as research, monitoring and evaluation. The world has turned the corner on tobacco.

2018-10-09T14:46:20Z,Could this be the start of the end of world poverty? | Kevin Watkins,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/09/sustainable-development-goals-bali-human-capital,"Three years ago the world lined up behind an ambitious set of targets – the sustainable development goals – for 2030. The checklist included the eradication of extreme poverty, ending preventable child deaths and delivering quality universal education. As part of the pledge, governments committed to achieving the most rapid progress among populations left furthest behind. To describe the 2030 project as being off track would constitute epic understatement. There have been extraordinary achievements over the past 15 years on many fronts. Extreme poverty has fallen dramatically and child deaths have halved. Yet the pace of global poverty reduction is slowing and the number of extreme poor in Africa is still rising. On current trends there will still be more than 3 million preventable child deaths in 2030. Progress on malnutrition has stalled. And in an increasingly knowledge-based global economy in which automation threatens jobs, 617 million children are either out of school or set to emerge from school lacking basic literacy and numeracy skills. Now as governments descend on Bali, Indonesia, this week for the International Monetary Fund/World Bank annual meetings, they once again have an opportunity to get behind an initiative that could transform prospects for global poverty eradication. The World Bank is using this year’s gathering to launch a “human capital project”. No, it doesn’t sound very exciting. But the aim is to fundamentally reconfigure how governments view investment. The World Bank’s president, Jim Kim, will warn the Bali meeting that short-sighted approaches to economic growth are skewing towards economic infrastructure – such as new roads and bridges – and away from human capital investments in the health, education and nutrition of people. Sustainable economic development requires both. Human capital is not a new idea. Adam Smith wrote about it in The Wealth of Nations. What is new is the World Bank giving finance ministers the wake-up call that underinvestment in human capital is not just catastrophic for the 2030 goals, but also bad for economic growth. The project will shine a spotlight on governments that underperform. The World Bank has also pledged to rebalance the focus on human capital in its own operations. Inequality is at the heart of this shortfall. Poverty is falling too slowly, in part because the benefits of growth in Africa and elsewhere are skewed towards the wealthy. Child mortality is coming down, but death rates among the poorest children in many countries are still two to three times higher than those for the richest. Girls, children with disabilities and minority groups are also left behind. Social disparities are declining at a glacial pace, not least because governments have failed to act on a commitment to invest in truly universal health coverage. Tackling the power relationships behind these inequalities will take more than policy pronouncements. Some of the governments that will wax lyrical on human capital at this week’s meetings in Bali have appalling records of their own. Countries such as India and Nigeria are spending less than 1% of national income on health, effectively denying their citizens access to care – and consigning children to early graves. Like many of the governments it will justifiably criticise, the World Bank itself has been underinvesting in education. One-off grading exercises will serve little purpose. The World Bank and UN agencies should relentlessly keep the spotlight on human capital inequalities within countries – and track the pace at which those inequalities are being closed. If governments are serious about the 2030 development goals, they will need to align public spending priorities with a dramatically enhanced commitment to equity. That means investing in health and education systems that reach the poor with decent, quality services, and in the progressive taxation systems needed to underpin those services. Meanwhile, the IMF will need to loosen the fiscal policy straitjackets that accompany its loans and undercut social spending, and also focus on the quality of money spent – it could do far more to target resources wasted through corruption. None of this will happen without the engagement of campaigners. Ten years ago we lined up behind banners pledging to make poverty history. The “human capital project” has less of a ring to it. But, make no mistake, this is a cause worth fighting for. • Kevin Watkins is chief executive of Save the Children UK",Sustainable development goals; Inequality and development; Global education; Global health; Global development; Inequality,Opinion
2018-10-16T01:04:08Z,"More than three million Australians living in poverty, Acoss report reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/16/more-than-three-million-australians-living-in-poverty-acoss-report-reveals,"Poverty has become a consistent feature of Australian life, with millions still living below the breadline despite 27 years of uninterrupted economic growth, the Australian Council of Social Service says. A vital circuit-breaker is needed, including a complete overhaul of Australia’s employment services, a commitment to “full employment” and a guarantee of at least two days a week of early childhood care – highly subsidised for people on low incomes – and education for every child. A new report, Poverty in Australia 2018, has been released to coincide with Anti-Poverty Week. It shows there are just over three million people (13.2%) living below the relative poverty line, including 739,000 children (17.3% of children). The relative poverty line is considered to be 50% of median household disposable income. In Australia, the poverty line is defined as a single adult living on less than $433 a week, or $909 for a couple with two children, before housing costs. The figures refer to 2015-16, the most recent year for which data is available. One in eight adults and more than one in six children are living in poverty, and many of those are living in “deep poverty” – a staggering $135 per week below the poverty line on average. Cassandra Goldie, the chief executive of Acoss, said those experiencing poverty at the highest rates were those unable to get paid work, who were relying on Youth Allowance and Newstart. “The evidence released today shows that through social security, housing and employment policies, as a nation we choose the level of poverty we are prepared to accept,” she said. “The government argues that poverty in Australia is not the problem. They are wrong. People on the lowest incomes cannot afford to pay for the very basics of life – housing, food, energy, health and getting their teeth fixed. “Poverty is now a consistent feature of Australian life. Are we prepared to accept this?” Australia is the second-wealthiest country in the world in terms of wealth per adult, but its poverty rate has become entrenched at a high level. It is currently 14th highest out of 36 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. The overall poverty rate has fluctuated within a band between 11.5% and 14.4% between 1999-2000 and 2015-16. Poverty declined substantially from 13.1% in 1999 to 11.5% in 2003, rose sharply during the boom years to 14.4% just before the global financial crisis in 2007, declined to 12.6% in 2009, and has since plateaued, hitting 12.8% in 2015-16. Child poverty moved within a higher band, fluctuating between 14.3% and 18.6% from 1999 to 2015. It is currently 17.3%. A major reason Australia’s poverty rate is so high is the low level of social security payments. Most people below the poverty line in Australia (53%) rely on social security as their main source of income, but most major income support payments sit well below the poverty line. To escape poverty, Australians need to supplement their social security payments with private income or move out of the social security system altogether (if able to do so), and escaping poverty is easier if the payment sits close to the poverty line. The freezing of the Newstart Allowance (which has not increased above inflation since 1994) has increased poverty among those receiving that payment. Poverty among people in households relying mainly on the Newstart allowance rose from 61% in 1999 to 78% in 2015, while the average poverty gap (for households reliant on Newstart Allowance below the poverty line) rose from $81 per week to $136 per week over the same period. Last month, the Newstart allowance was boosted by $2 a week, an increase that people relying on the payment said was laughable. Welfare payments such as Newstart, Youth Allowance and the pension increase twice a year through indexation – but are pegged to different rates. In September, the base rate of Newstart rose by $2.20 – or about 30c a day – to $275.10 a week. A report by Deloitte Access Economics released last month said the decision to tie Newstart to prices rather than wages reflected a “difference in generosity”, and meant for those on Newstart, “your living standards are set to sink relative to national averages”. Prof Peter Saunders from the University of New South Wales, lead researcher of the Poverty in Australia 2018 report, said the Australian government has joined other nations in adopting the sustainable development goals, which include reducing by half poverty rates for men, women and children by 2030, but Australia was a long way from achieving them. “Australia lacks a poverty reduction plan and we do not have regular monitoring and reporting by governments on progress to address poverty,” he said.",Welfare; Sustainable development goals; Australian economy; Australia news; Poverty; Australian politics,Australia news
2019-06-03T05:23:52Z,Monday briefing: Trump flies in to Brexit Britain,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/03/monday-briefing-trump-flies-in-to-brexit-britain,"Top story: Protesters promise show of force Good morning, this is Alison Rourke bringing you this Monday briefing on what’s set to be a blockbuster week in politics. All eyes will be on London today as Donald Trump flies in for his much-anticipated visit. The trip could provide some awkward moments when he meets Theresa May in her last few days as prime minister (she is set to formally resign on Friday). The White House sees the trip as an opportunity for a “reset moment” on trade, but Trump lands in the thick of the Tory leadership battle, in which he has made no bones about his preferred candidate, Boris Johnson. On potentially meeting Johnson, Trump told reporters before he left Washington: “Well I may meet with him, he’s been a friend of mine, he’s been very nice.” He also added he had a “very good relationship with Nigel Farage”. May meanwhile has called the visit “a significant week for the special relationship and an opportunity to further strengthen our already close partnership”. She stressed the need to build closer trading ties, but with only five days left in the job, it’s hard to see how much influence she will have. Another Johnson has also been helping set the scene ahead of the visit – Trump’s US ambassador in the UK, Woody Johnson, has suggested the NHS should be “on the table” in future trade negotiations with the US. Trump’s man in London also indicated the UK would need to allow US agricultural products, including chlorinated chicken, on to the UK market as part of any post-Brexit trade deal. So there will be plenty of subjects to avoid during the president’s banquet at Buckingham Palace tonight with the Queen, before formal talks in Downing Street tomorrow, when the giant Trump baby balloon is expected to fly over large protests. * * * Tory hopefuls – As the 13 runners and riders in the Conservative party leadership race jockey for position, the centrist Matt Hancock will today call for the UK to allow complete freedom of movement for medics from around the world. The health secretary will promise to lift all immigration restrictions for qualified doctors and nurses of any nationality who have secured a job in the NHS. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has put forward his first major domestic policy proposal, saying he would “significantly” lift spending on secondary school students to at least £5,000 per pupil if he became the next prime minister. * * * Jared Kushner – The US Middle East envoy has expressed uncertainty over the ability of Palestinians to self-govern, in a rare television interview broadcast last night. Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law and an architect of the White House’s yet-to-be-released Middle East peace plan, said it would be a “high bar” when asked if the Palestinians could expect freedom from Israeli military and government interference. Kushner again avoided saying explicitly whether the plan would include a two-state solution, the bedrock of US policy for decades. But he said: “I do think they should have self-determination. I’m going to leave the details until we come out with the actual plan.” * * * Not so equal – Not a single country is expected to achieve gender equality by 2030, according to the first index to measure progress against a set of internationally agreed targets. According to the inaugural SDG Gender Index, launched today, even the Nordic states, which score highly in the index, would need to take huge strides to fulfil gender commitments in the 17 sustainable development goals, which 193 countries signed up to in 2015. The index measured progress in 129 countries, marking them from zero to 100. Countries with an overall score of 90 or more are making excellent progress, but only 21 countries got 80 or above. Denmark came in first with 89.3. The UK came 17th with 82.2. * * * Reality TV’s body anxiety – Young people’s worries about how they look are being fuelled by aspirational TV shows, according to a new survey by the Mental Health Foundation, which released the report ahead of the new series of Love Island. Almost one in four people (24%) aged 18-24 say reality TV makes them worry about their body image, according to the YouGov survey of 4,505 UK adults. More than one in seven (15%) said they had self-harmed or deliberately hurt themselves because of concerns about their body image, and 23% had experienced suicidal thoughts because of concerns in relation to their body image. The foundation’s Dr Antonis Kousoulis acknowledged that the show had issued mental health aftercare guidelines for contestants, “but they must also take into consideration the potential damage being done to viewers”, adding that contestants’ appearance are “not diverse, [are] largely unrealistic and [are] presented as aspirational”. * * * Drink up – Coffee addicts will be pleased to hear that scientists say drinking up to 25 cups a day is not bad for your heart. Some previous studies have suggested that coffee stiffens arteries, putting pressure on the heart and increasing the likelihood of a heart attack or stroke, with drinkers warned to cut down. But a new study (part-funded by the British Heart Foundation) of more than 8,000 people across the UK found that drinking five cups a day, and even up to 25, is no worse for the arteries than drinking less than a cup a day. Today in Focus podcast: Inside Isis Martin Chulov, the Guardian’s Middle East correspondent, discusses his meeting with Umm Sayyaf, the most senior female Islamic State captive. In her first interview, Sayyaf reveals her role in helping the CIA hunt for the ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. And Johny Pitt on how an ice bath with pop duo Jedward promoted a journey around Europe exploring Afropean identity. Lunchtime read: ‘We needed to speak our truth – and forgive’ Six years ago, on the back of 17m album sales, the Jonas Brothers split, devastating their fans, many of whom had watched their rise from Disney. Now they’re back with a No 1 single and talking about marriage, family rifts and why it took so long to patch things up. More than half a decade since their split (that was blamed on a “deep rift within the band”) the brothers are married, settled and arguably in better musical shape than ever before, writes the Guardian’s Peter Robinson. But their journey through teenage stardom and a rift in the band at the time when their father was managing them, left its marks. “I was mad as hell,” says Joe Jonas of his younger brother Nick’s move to instigate the split. Nick says his dad handled things well, balancing being both manager and parent. “Because I had initiated the conversation for the group to break up, he was comforting to me while I spoke my truth. Then when Joe and Kevin’s reaction was complicated, he was a father to them, and managerial to me.” Although the brothers were hardly estranged, there was a multi-platinum elephant in the room at family events. In 2017 came the idea of a Jonas Brothers documentary, Chasing Happiness, which is out this week on Amazon. The main aim was closure: “We definitely didn’t think we were going to get back together,” Joe says. But a full reunion followed and the album Happiness Begins is released this week. Sport Liverpool want to extend Jürgen Klopp’s contract following the Champions League triumph his players believe heralds the beginning of a glittering era under their charismatic manager. Anthony Joshua confirmed his intent to enforce an immediate return fight with Andy Ruiz Jr, admitting he was so confident in the run-up to his astounding defeat that he had not bothered asking whether a rematch clause was in the contract. Johanna Konta became the first British woman to reach the last eight of the French Open since Jo Durie in 1983, while Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal seem to be operating in their own dimension at Roland Garros, moving into the quarter-finals with uncanny synchronicity. And Richard Carapaz became Ecuador’s first grand tour champion by winning the Giro d’Italia while Chad Haga of the US was fastest in the final stage’s individual time trial. Business Amazon is opening up a new front on its retail dominance, opening a chain of pop-up shops selling everything from food and drink to electronics, beauty products and homewares. The year-long pilot, launched in conjunction with the small business support organisation Enterprise Nation, will give 100 small online businesses a high street presence, with the first Clicks and Mortar shop opening today in St Mary’s Gate in central Manchester. It will also offer lockers for customers to collect Amazon orders. The company plans to open 10 shops in total. It hasn’t revealed the locations of the other stores but said there would be openings in Wales, Scotland, the Midlands, Yorkshire and the south-east. On the markets, US stock futures, Asian shares and oil prices slipped to multi-month lows on Monday on worries that intensifying Chin-US tensions and Washington’s new tariff threats against Mexico could tip the global economy into a recession. The E-mini futures for S&amp;P500 dropped 0.5% in early Asian trade to 2,738, near their March low of 2,722, while Japan’s Nikkei skidded 1.1% to a four-month low. The pound is buying €1.131 and $1.265. The papers Trump’s visit and Huawei dominate the front pages today. The Guardian has: “Trump arrives amid rising anger at US trade demands” and the i reports: “May urged to confront Trump on climate”. The Daily Mail reports that Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid may u-turn over the government’s decision to allow 5G access to the Chinese giant: “Tories’ Huawei deal warning”, as does the Telegraph: “Tories bow on Huawei as Trump lands in UK” and the Sun combines the two subjects: “Trump: It’s my way or Huawei”.

2018-12-15T08:00:05Z,"Legal plastic content in animal feed could harm human health, experts warn",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/15/legal-plastic-content-in-animal-feed-could-harm-human-health-experts-warn,"Plastic traces in animal feed could pose a risk to human health and urgently need to be the subject of more research, experts have told the Guardian. Their comments came after British farmer Andrew Rock contacted the Guardian, having noticed plastic shreds in his animal feed. Rock was told by the suppliers that this was a legal part of the recycling process that turns waste food, still packaged, into animal feed. Rock runs a small-scale pig farm in Lincolnshire, and had been spotting tiny pieces of plastic in his pigs feed for several months. “In the back of my head I thought maybe it was people dropping gloves into the feed mill. I took a kilo scoop out of the bag and I did this over several weeks. I laid it out in the light and I found plastic in nearly every scoop.” He contacted the suppliers who had sold him the feed and was shocked to discover that the fragments were not a mistake, but in fact a legal part of the recycling process that turns waste food, still packaged, into animal feed. More than 650,000 tonnes of unused food, from loaves of bread to Mars bars, are saved from landfill each year in the UK by being turned into animal feed. The system that strips off the plastic wrappings can’t capture it all, and so in the UK a limit of 0.15% of plastic is allowed by the Food Standards Agency. The official EU level for plastic permitted in animal feed is zero although in reality many other countries operate within the same 0.15% limit. In response to his questions about whether even these limits were safe for consumption, the suppliers told him that the product was within legal limits and came from a third-party mill accredited by Ufas, the Universal Feed Assurance Scheme. Ufas is a voluntary scheme, run by the Agricultural Industries Confederation. They confirmed to the Guardian that they were going to look at the complaints made by Mr Rock, but said their findings would be covered by strict confidentiality agreements. But Rock says it is the fact that this is legal that shocked him. “I think the only people that are not shocked by this are the people involved in the animal feed manufacture. I was disturbed by their casual acceptance.” Dr Heather Leslie told the Guardian that “the only level of plastic in animal feed should be none at all”. Leslie is an ecotoxicologist specialising in microplastics at the Vrije University in Amsterdam. “There is a lack of transparency for what the animals that citizens are eating have been fed. Citizens have no way of knowing what they are actually eating. “Tiny microplastics can be released from larger pieces during feed processing and the smaller fractions are, we think, even more risky for the animal’s health. We’ve known for decades that after ingestion fine plastic particles cross the mammalian gut barrier and enter the bloodstream. It’s already been tested in pigs, dogs, rats and also in chickens. From the bloodstream they can be transported to tissues and organs. We know this from studies with rats.” “I definitely hope there is more research,” said Dr Stephanie Wright, a Research Associate at King’s College London studying the impact on human health of microplastics. She pointed out that there is a risk of chemicals leaching from plastics, even very small parts. “The chemicals at microscopic level in the network that make up plastic, [that are used] to give flexibility, or flame retardent properties, they can come off very easily, they are susceptible to leaching. This is why BPA [a chemical found in food packaging] was banned from baby bottles, because it leached into the milk from the plastic. She cautioned however that the chemical burden on humans and animals from the environment around them is so great that it would be difficult to know whether plastic in animal feed played a key role. She said: “We have currently produced around 8bn tonnes of plastic. By 2050 there will be 25bn tonnes on the planet. Human chemical production is rising.” Paul Featherstone, chairman of the UK Former Foodstuffs Processors Association and group director of animal feed producer SugaRich, told the Guardian that every effort was made in the process to keep plastic traces to an absolute minimum, and pointed out that the issue of preventing waste food from going to landfill was a huge environmental concern. “In line with the vast majority of EU countries we have a tolerance of 0.15% by weight of plastic residue. We don’t set that as a target, we want to be way, way beneath that. We don’t want to be putting anything injurious to an animal into feed. “This practice has been around a long time, since the farmer living next to a biscuit factory would have taken the waste. But now it’s been formalised and it’s really gone up a gear since the idea of the circular economy developed. This is part of the sustainable development goals. We have to look at how we get this waste into the feed chain safely. The risks posed traded off against the benefit Europe-wide of 3.5m tonnes of food going back into use is a logical and risk-assessed benefit that we should all think is a good idea.” Globally, about a third of all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted from the farm to the fork. Food that is ultimately lost or wasted consumes about a quarter of all water used by agriculture, requires a land area the size of China and is responsible for an estimated 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The FSA told the Guardian: “Based on current information, including the evaluation on the safety of microplastics exposure from food undertaken by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the FSA considers it is unlikely that the levels of microplastic particles that have been reported to occur in certain types of food would cause harm to consumers.” This article was corrected on 15 December 2018. A previous version had said that there would be 25bn tonnes of plastic on the planet by 2015; this should have said 2050.",Plastics; Farming; Environment; Waste; Food waste; UK news; Health; Society,Environment
2019-01-24T06:01:00Z,How diplomatic missions became entangled with the tobacco industry,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/24/diplomatic-missions-tobacco-industry-ideas-thinktank,"The British high commission in Malaysia gave tens of thousands of pounds to a local thinktank while it argued against tobacco controls already enacted in the UK. At the same time it was funded by the British foreign office, the thinktank received substantial funding from three multinational tobacco companies. The conduct of the high commission raises questions about whether diplomats went against guidelines to “limit interactions” with the tobacco industry, following previous criticism of diplomatic support for the tobacco industry abroad. British and American diplomatic missions funded the thinktank, the Kuala Lumpur-based Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs (Ideas), while it argued against tobacco taxes and plain packaging. The UK enacted plain packaging in 2014. The news follows a Guardian analysis of free-market thinktanks around the world that have taken positions aligned with the tobacco industry. Many thinktanks argued that they recognize the risks of smoking, were independent and opposed ineffective regulation rather than all tobacco regulation. The analysis revealed at least 106 free-market thinktanks around the world took positions aligned with the tobacco industry in the past decade, accepted donations from the tobacco industry or both. Reporting by the Observer last year has also shown how how the Foreign Office championed British American Tobacco’s interests abroad. A spokesperson for Britain’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) told the Guardian: “The British high commission in Malaysia has not and does not co-finance or partner in any way with tobacco companies, or support projects which promote tobacco use. “All FCO-led programmes follow the standards set out by HM Treasury. They receive robust scrutiny to ensure that all spend represents value for money for UK taxpayers and advances the UN’s sustainable development goals and our foreign policy objectives.” Mary Assunta, a senior policy adviser at the Southeast Asia Tobacco Control Alliance (Seatca), said: “Ideas jumped into tobacco control only recently and was making policy statements that echoed the tobacco industry’s position. “When a group or a consultant uses certain familiar buzz words and pushes anti-health proposals, look deeper, and you will find the link to the tobacco industry.” In response to questions from the Guardian, Ideas said it followed “a strict policy of editorial independence”, and “thus no donations influence our research and analytical outputs”. “Less than 15% of our annual funding from the tobacco industry,” Ideas said, noting that it publicly disclosed donations by tobacco companies. “Ideas is perhaps the only civil society organization in Malaysia which maintains this level of transparency. In these financial records, the names of tobacco firms are clearly mentioned and we have never denied this.” In 2016, Ideas started commenting on tobacco control in Malaysia. In one example, the group’s then executive director, Wan Saiful Wan Jan, wrote a column in the national newspaper the Star criticizing the Malaysian health department’s push for plain packaging. “I don’t smoke and I get annoyed if people smoke near me,” he wrote. “But notwithstanding my attitude towards smoking, paternalistic government behaviour is more dangerous and must be rejected when we see it.” In June 2016, Seatca warned the British high commission in Malaysia that Ideas was “mouthing the same arguments used by the tobacco industry in the UK”. Nevertheless, the high commission increased funding in 2017. The British government’s contribution grew from £46,552 ($60,299) in 2016 to £72,820 ($94,324) in 2017. That nearly made the British high commission the group’s largest funder, second only to the philanthropic arm of the Malaysian transportation conglomerate Sime Darby. At the same time, Ideas received donations from Philip Morris Singapore, Philip Morris Malaysia and Japan Tobacco International. Between 2016 and 2017, the three tobacco companies donated £42,411. British American Tobacco also said it “supports” Ideas. The British high commission provided funding to Ideas just a few years after British diplomats were criticized for aiding BAT in Pakistan and Panama, according to the Financial Times. As a result, rules established in 2013 forbade diplomats from lobbying “against any local administration’s policies that are aimed at improving public health, or engage with foreign governments on behalf of the tobacco industry”. The new rules stated diplomats “should limit interactions with the tobacco industry, including any person or organization that is likely to be working to further the interests of the tobacco industry”. Ideas received donations from the US National Endowment for Democracy (Ned) and the International Republican Institute (IRI), both groups which receive most of their funding from the American government. Ned, which gave Ideas $80,000, said it was “unaware of the funding from tobacco groups” or Ideas’s “comments on tobacco related policy in local Malaysian media”. Ned no longer funds Ideas. Ned said it provided funding to a number of other free-market focused thinktanks as recently as this year. At least four opposed plain packaging of cigarettes, including the Policy Research Institute of Market Economy in Pakistan, the Samriddhi Foundation of Nepal, the Libertarian Club Libek in Serbia and the Free Market Foundation of South Africa. Ned and IRI said its donations were not related to tobacco policy. In the US, foreign donations to American thinktanks have come under scrutiny as a form of potential lobbying. ﻿While Ideas disclosed its donors, many free-market thinktanks do not, including some which received funding from western diplomats. For example, the influential Ghanaian thinktank Imani Centre for Policy and Education argued so vociferously against tobacco control that the nation’s health department quoted local activists as saying Imani was an organization which “fronts for the tobacco industry” in an official report to the WHO. Imani told the Guardian the last tobacco industry donation it received was roughly four years ago. In one 2012 editorial, Imani’s leader argued the link between lung cancer and smoking has “yet to be empirically established”. Imani told the Guardian it no longer denies smoking causes lung cancer. Nevertheless, the Danish embassy made Imani a key partner in an effort to modernize the Ghana Revenue Authority, providing it with more than £656,000 ($849,716). The authority of thinktanks, Barrington said, “lies in, ‘You can believe me, because I have independent research here.’ If that is compromised, people stop listening to you. You might as well go straight to the tobacco company.” In large part, tobacco companies told the Guardian they supported like-minded organizations, like many other businesses. A spokesperson for Philip Morris International said: “We have worked, and will continue to work, with carefully selected organizations around the world who share our desire to promote policies that produce meaningful public health improvements. It is absolutely ridiculous to imply that supporting an organization would result in a group taking action they otherwise would fundamentally oppose.” Sam Cleverly, group head of corporate affairs at BAT, said: “Like many other companies, we support like-minded organizations on issues that are important to our business and our consumers. “We believe publicly elected officials should be allowed to hear all sides of any debate when formulating policy and should be trusted to make informed decisions once they have heard and considered all the arguments.” Jonathan Duce, head of external affairs for Japan Tobacco, said: “It is clear to everyone that there are health risks associated with smoking – we are fully transparent about this.” He continued: “We are not alone in our thinking and various groups across the world share our view that any regulation, tobacco-related or not, if untested and unproven, could have seriously negative knock-on effects.”﻿",Tobacco industry; Thinktanks; British American Tobacco; Philip Morris International; Business; World news; UK news; US news; Politics,World news
2018-07-23T16:22:47Z,Global Disability Summit is full of opportunity and promise | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/23/global-disability-summit-is-full-of-opportunity-and-promise,"Tuesday is full of opportunity and promise, as world leaders descend on London for the UK’s first ever Global Disability Summit. We, some of the UK’s leading international development organisations, call on decision-makers to make lasting commitments to people living with disabilities across the world. Through ignorance, indifference or intention, people with disabilities, 80% of whom live in the world’s poorest countries, continue to be excluded from society. They face multiple forms of discrimination and are denied equal rights to many fundamental aspects of life, including access to quality education, earning a living, having a family and even making independent decisions about their own lives. Inclusion of people with disabilities must be at the heart of all aid, development and humanitarian efforts if we are to achieve the United Nations sustainable development goals by 2030. People with disabilities must not only be heard, but be at the forefront of decision-making about their lives and issues that affect them. Assistive technology must also be harnessed to empower people with disabilities to live healthy, productive and independent lives. Without good quality, consistent data on disability, addressing the rights and needs of people is a challenge and they risk being left behind. For every person to count, people with disabilities of all ages must be counted. By hosting Tuesday’s summit, the UK has shown leadership in this crucial area and we call on those present to make measurable, ambitious and lasting commitments. Now is the time to end discrimination against, and ensure equal rights for, the 1 billion people living with disabilities across the world.

2018-07-24T05:00:06Z,"People with disabilities failed by dearth of funding worldwide, say campaigners",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jul/24/people-with-disabilities-dearth-funding-worldwide-disability-summit,"People with disabilities worldwide are being let down by underfunding whether they live in poor or wealthy nations. Despite growing recognition of the importance of inclusion, this is not supported by the reality, say disability organisations. Many countries have been slow to implement the 2006 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The UK government is holding its first global disability summit, co-hosted with the International Disability Alliance and the Kenyan government, on Tuesday in London. Government officials, the private sector, donor agencies and NGOs will be asked to support a charter for change endorsing rights, dignity and inclusion for people with disabilities. The prime minister, Theresa May, said the summit would be dedicated to “transforming the lives of the most vulnerable”. “The path a person takes in life should not be dictated by their disability and yet people are forced, every day, to deal with prejudice and even violence,” she said. “We are committed to ending discrimination and stigma against disabled people.” May’s comments came just a week after the UK government had caved to pressure and agreed to backdate benefit payments to ill and disabled claimants who were left thousands of pounds out of pocket as a result of a series of bureaucratic errors. In 2017, a UN inquiry criticised the UK for not auditing the impact of austerity policies on the disabled as well as failing to uphold disability rights across the wider range from education, work and housing to health, transport and social security. Progress has been made globally, such as the Peruvian constitution recognising the right to legal capacity for people with intellectual or mental health disabilities. Yet one in five people living in poverty worldwide have a disability, and 82% of those with disabilities live on less than $1 a day. Despite many countries making inroads in reducing poverty, the situation for people with disabilities has not improved alongside. About 40% of children with disabilities in developing countries do not attend school. “To realise the promise of the sustainable development goals to leave no one behind, and to further the principles reflected in the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities, we need to work together to share expertise, coordinate actions and raise the profile of disability across a broader range of organisations contributing to international development efforts,” said Vladimir Cuk, executive director of the International Disability Alliance. Cuk pointed to the discrepancy in the commitments that followed the “big three” global conventions – the rights of the child, the rights of women and the rights of people with disabilities. While Unicef receives $5bn (£3.8bn) annually harnessing global political commitment to implement the convention on the rights of the child, the UN Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has a budget of just $5m per year. UN Women, which campaigns for women’s rights, has a projected $1.15bn for 2018-2019. “It’s not that other groups receive too much financial support,” said Cuk. “It’s just that the discrepancy explains in part the relatively slow implementation of rights for people with disabilities.” The London summit aims to encourage further partnerships between bigger NGOs and those with specialist expertise. The international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, said: “For too long many people living with disabilities in the world’s poorest countries have not been able to fulfil their potential due to stigma or a lack of practical support. They are, for example, missing out on school and the chance to work. “Discrimination is unacceptable in today’s society.”",Global development; Human rights; Disability; Department for International Development (DfID); Kenya; Inequality and development; Africa; World news,Global development
2018-10-08T01:00:07Z,We must reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero or face more floods | Nicholas Stern,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/we-must-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions-to-net-zero-or-face-more-floods,"The authoritative new report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change sets the world a clear target: we must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to net zero by the middle of this century to have a reasonable chance of limiting global warming to 1.5C. Every government should read this report and recognise the clear choice we now have. Accelerate the transition to clean and sustainable growth or suffer the mounting damage from sea level rise, floods and droughts that will severely hinder efforts to tackle poverty, raise living standards and improve prosperity. The report, prepared by leading researchers from around the world, warns that the world has already warmed by about 1C since the middle of the 19th century, and could reach 1.5C at the current rate of warming before the middle of this century. Human activities are currently emitting about 42bn tonnes of carbon dioxide every year, and at that rate the carbon budget – allowing us a 50-50 chance of keeping warming to 1.5C – would be exhausted within 20 years. Even 1.5C of warming would have brutal consequences, according to the report. Poor people, in particular, would suffer as the threat of food and water shortages increase in some parts of the world. But the report makes clear that allowing warming to reach 2C would create risks that any reasonable person would regard as deeply dangerous. One of the report’s most stark statements is that “limiting global warming to 1.5C, compared with 2C, could reduce the number of people both exposed to climate-related risks and susceptible to poverty by up to several hundred million by 2050”. However, the report also makes clear that the target of halting global warming at 1.5C could still be technically feasible, particularly if there is a strong and immediate response from governments. The report recognises that the collective pledges by governments that were submitted before the Paris agreement was reached in 2015 are consistent with warming of 3C by the end of the century. By contrast, a path that would prevent a rise of much more than 1.5C would require annual emissions to fall by about 50% between now and 2030, and reach net zero by 2050. We have to achieve these emissions reductions over a period when the world’s economy will experience a radical transformation. Global infrastructure will have more than doubled between 2015 and 2030. The global economy will have doubled within two decades or so if it continues to grow at about 3% each year on average. And the population living in cities, where most emissions occur, will likely double in the next four decades. Hence the next 10 years will be absolutely crucial in determining what kind of world will exist in the decades beyond. If we act decisively, and innovate and invest wisely, we could both avoid the worst impacts of climate change and successfully achieve the sustainable development goals, as the IPCC report emphasises. If we do not, we face a world in which it will become increasingly difficult for us and future generations to thrive. But we will also need greater international cooperation. The IPCC report is clear that we may not be able to limit warming to 1.5C without the need later in the century to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Although we can do this by expanding forests and other vegetation, we must also explore other options, including the development of carbon capture and storage. While many green campaigners are opposed to this technology because they fear it could undermine the pressure on the fossil-fuel industry, we cannot afford to close it off as an option. A collective international effort is needed to speed up research, development and deployment of this area. While it is clear that it is still technically feasible to limit warming to 1.5C, we will not succeed without strong political will and leadership. Governments should recognise both the great peril we face from poor choices or hesitation, and the enormous opportunity on offer from the rapid transition to a clean and sustainable economy. Governments, companies and communities should embrace this transition: it is the growth story of the 21st century. Cities must be planned so that we can live, breathe and move freely in them. And we must reverse the degradation of our land, soils and forests so that they are more productive and absorb more carbon dioxide. All of this is both possible and extremely attractive, as the most recent report from the New Climate Economy, published last month, spells out. We will see in the next two years whether governments have understood the message of this IPCC report as they revise their nationally determined contributions to the Paris agreement. We have in our grasp the opportunity to choose a safer and more prosperous future.

2018-09-20T10:13:54Z,'Money is not the goal': the rise of the female investor,https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2018/sep/20/money-is-not-the-goal-the-rise-of-the-female-investor,"What image springs to mind when you hear the word “investor”? Perhaps a man, in a suit, shaking the hand of another man in a suit? (That’s certainly what Google Images offers up.) It’s about bravado and making the big bucks. But that picture is out of date. Women are investing more and more and they’re choosing companies that have a positive impact on the planet, as well as their portfolios. Olivia Sibony is head of impact crowdfunding at Seedtribe – an investment platform that links socially minded investors with businesses that do good (recent examples include a tool to help small- and medium-sized enterprises give to charity, and a plastic recycling plant). Crucially, the minimum investment is £100, a figure low enough, Sibony hopes, to appeal to people who wouldn’t traditionally invest, particularly millennials and women. “They are much more socially conscious and aware and they want to create change,” she says. “You no longer need to have a spare £10,000 or £20,000 to become an investor, you can make a difference with a few hundred pounds, and also make a return. “At the end of the day, money is not the goal, but money is the common language. For us, a business has to pay the bills, but the purpose of that business has to be impact.” This means that when companies apply to join Seedtribe, they have to prove their potential for profit as well as their social credentials. It’s a rigorous process, and only a tiny fraction have made it through since the platform launched in 2017; Sibony rejects about 99% of pitches. What she’s looking for, she explains, is simple but hard to find: profit-driven businesses that truly address social or environmental challenges. “We do get some people trying to greenwash the impact side,” she continues. “Someone came to me the other day with a pitch about how important it was for people’s mental health to have stations all over London to charge their mobile phones, because they suffer from anxiety if their phone runs out of battery. “That’s not impactful, quite the opposite. There could be a strong team and a good business model – but if it’s not going to make the world a better place, it gets rejected.” Sibony is able to speak from experience – she was a co-founder of the sharing economy food startup Grub Club and says she “made every mistake under the sun” on the way to becoming a success. The networks she established in that time have helped to get an impressive gender balance of entrepreneurs approaching Seedtribe, however, with around 30% to 40% of pitches now coming from female-led companies. The vast majority of the site’s investors, however, are still male (she estimates around 90%). “I guess it’s logical, historically, but it doesn’t have to be that way,” she says. “I’m focusing a lot of my energy on changing that and bringing more female investors on to the platform. “It’s not my sole purpose – my ultimate aim is to get investment for the best possible businesses that are impactful – but unless we have a better diversity of investors, we are missing out on opportunities for really impactful businesses.” And the women she’s speaking to are enthusiastic about the focus on impact, she continues. Although women have traditionally been regarded as more cautious than men when it comes to investing, Sibony says she’s finding that they’re happy to take bigger risks when they are contributing to projects for the greater good. But, she explains, the initial conversations with female investors often require a different approach to those with men. Many women are turned off by the word investment, thinking of it as something that’s not for them. Instead, she says, it can be helpful to link investment opportunities to the story of the company. “Semantics are so important,” she says. “When you reposition it and say: ‘I know this person who is setting up this great business and would love some mentoring and guidance and a bit of cash to help boost it’, they feel excited about being a part of it. That’s investing, of course, but they feel that it’s something they can contribute to.” Sibony uses the UN’s 17 sustainable development goals as a framework for judging impact, and she says that they serve as a constant guiding force for the areas that Seedtribe’s businesses should be addressing. But it’s the fifth goal – gender equality – that she’s most passionate about. “As women, we have an incredible power to address challenges in a different way,” she says. “The more we can empower women and build that confidence, the more I think everything can change. Now that we have a louder and louder voice, we have an amazing opportunity to make that change and I’m honoured to be part of it.”",Work & careers; Money; Investing; Business; Technology; Crowdfunding,Guardian Careers
2018-09-11T10:04:25Z,"Global hunger levels rising due to extreme weather, UN warns",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/11/global-hunger-levels-rising-due-to-extreme-weather-un-warns,"Global hunger has reverted to levels last seen a decade ago, wiping out progress on improving people’s access to food and leaving one in nine people undernourished last year, with extreme weather a leading cause, the UN has warned. Hunger afflicted 821 million people last year, the third annual rise since 2015, with most regions of Africa and much of South America showing worsening signs of food shortages and malnutrition. More than half a billion of the world’s hungry live in Asia. The reversal of progress made in slowing malnutrition in the first half of this decade has caused serious concern among international agencies. Climate shocks, such as droughts and floods, were identified by the UN as “among the key drivers” for the rise in 2017, along with conflict and economic slowdowns. Nearly 100 million people were left dependent on humanitarian aid during the year. The UN report covers last year, and does not take account of 2018’s extreme weather which has brought heatwaves and high temperatures to much of the northern hemisphere, accompanied by droughts in some parts of the globe and floods in others. However, the changing climatic trends are likely to spell trouble for years ahead. Robin Willoughby, head of food and climate policy at Oxfam GB, said the last few months were likely to have made the situation even worse, and called on governments to commit funds to help poor countries adapt to the effects of global warming. “The extreme weather we have seen this year is likely to have exacerbated the crisis,” he said. “A hotter world is proving to be a hungrier world.” According to the report, there are more undernourished people in areas of the world that are highly exposed to extremes of climate. The authors note that there have been more frequent spells of extreme heat in the last five years, and that the nature of rainfall is changing in some areas, with rainy seasons starting earlier or later. Staple crops such as wheat, rice and maize are particularly at risk from climate extremes. “It is shocking that, after a prolonged decline, this is the third consecutive year of rising hunger,” said Willoughby. “The inescapable fact is that climate change is now leaving people around the world without enough to eat.” Adapting to climate change can be a matter of switching to less thirsty crops in some areas, and selectively breeding varieties for drought-resistance, or diversifying crops and using natural methods to make the best use of rainfall. Giving farmers access to transport to take their produce to market, and modern technology, such as weather forecasting communications, can also help. The UN’s State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2018 report, released on Tuesday, is the joint work of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, Unicef, the World Food Programme and the World Health Organisation. The heads of the agencies combined to warn of a worsening future, if action is not taken to help people adapt to climate change. “If we are to achieve a world without hunger and malnutrition in all its forms by 2030 [as the sustainable development goals state] it is imperative that we accelerate and scale up actions to strengthen the resilience and adaptive capacity of food systems and people’s livelihoods in response to climate variability and extremes,” they wrote in the foreword to the report. Cindy Holleman, a senior economist at the FAO and editor of the report, said: “What is alarming about this analysis is that climate variability and climate extremes now are contributing to the rise in hunger. Not just emergency levels of hunger, but chronic hunger. “We see this report as an early warning call that we need to accelerate and scale up climate resilience especially in countries in Africa and Latin America that are most vulnerable.” She added: “This is the beginning of a very serious situation. We have a target to end hunger by 2030, and we are not going to do that unless we are going to tackle new challenges and the new challenges are climate extremes and variability.” The analysis also showed that one in eight of the world’s adults – 672 million people – are now obese. This is increasingly regarded as a form of malnutrition associated with poverty, as poor people often lack access to good quality food. Other effects of malnutrition noted include 151 million children under five too short for their age owing to malnutrition, a fall from the 165 million recorded in 2012, with Asia accounting for 55% of the total. One in three women of reproductive age around the world have anaemia, which can also affect the development of their children, and only 40% of babies are breastfed exclusively to six months.",Climate crisis; Hunger; Global health; Global development; Society; Environment; World news,Environment

Penny Mordaunt reveals how UK aid can save the world",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/apr/12/penny-mordaunt-britain-big-plan-to-save-the-world,"Name: Penny Mordaunt. Age: 45. Appearance: Goddess. Armed with trident and shield. Sports a Corinthian helmet. Come again? Isn’t she the international development secretary? She is indeed. But she’s also a self-confessed champion of “British self-determination” and defender of national values, including freedom, equality, independence and democracy. And we know this how? Because she told us so, in a speech at London’s Wellcome Collection that was broadcast live on Facebook on Thursday morning. Facebook? How very modern. So what else did she say? Well, for starters, shortly after reminding her audience that she voted for Brexit, she said we’re “determined to be a great global nation”. Like the bit in Love Actually where Hugh Grant’s PM says “we may be a small country, but we are a great one”? Just so. But whereas Hugh conjured images of Britain as the country of Shakespeare, Harry Potter and David Beckham’s right foot (well, it was 2003), Mordaunt celebrated the nation as the home of Live Aid. Expanding on the aid theme, she emphasised that we’re “a global power, as well as a European one”, a land of selfless people who assist their neighbours at home and abroad because our nation is the “cradle for democracy”. Surely that was Ancient Greece? Details, details. The important thing to remember is we’re living in the age of a Global Britain that, far from retreating within itself, actively wants to engage with the wider world. To illustrate which, Mordaunt alluded to the values of two US presidents, noted for their enthusiastic engagement with global affairs. Er, OK. Which ones? First, to show how the British people believe in “we” rather than “they”, she plucked a line from JFK on how we all breathe the same air and cherish our children’s future. She then went on to evoke the spirit of Teddy Roosevelt’s foreign policy, reflecting that “we can only talk softly if we carry a big stick”. Well, you can’t beat a bit of gunboat diplomacy. You can if you’re wielding a big stick. Do say: “Rule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the waves!” Don’t say: “So tell me how we’re going to meet the sustainable development goals again?”",Global development; Penny Mordaunt; Aid; Politics; Brexit; UK news,Global development
2018-12-13T22:33:01Z,Australia is uniquely up to the task of solving 'wicked' problems around inequality | Mariana Mazzucato,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/14/australia-is-uniquely-up-to-the-task-of-solving-wicked-problems-around-inequality,"Visitors to Australia are drawn to this country’s iconic coastline. After landing in Sydney early in the morning I went straight to Bondi’s famous Icebergs ocean pool to do a few laps. It was spectacular. A gorgeous pool in the depths of the sea, a symbol that it’s not just infrastructure, but well-designed infrastructure that makes a difference: public value that public and private actors can create when they get the mix right. Icebergs is one of around 100 ocean baths in the state of New South Wales. Some are licenced to swimming clubs or private operators, many are maintained by local government. If Icebergs is any indication, they are all a unique public realm – long-lived investments that provide access to the natural environment, a base for local business, and a place for communities to come together. As any good swimmer knows, for all the activity above the waterline, the difference between success and failure happens under the surface. This is true of entire economies, too. As the Chair of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, quipped last week, Australia’s 27 years of consecutive economic growth “feels like forever” by global standards. Australians are rightly proud of that performance. Thanks to an effective fiscal stimulus package, and a well-timed mining boom, Australia’s economy managed to grow during the global financial crisis that plunged most of the advanced economies into severe recession. But recently cracks have started to appear. Inequality is rising. Concerns over housing affordability have skyrocketed. The Banking Royal Commission has highlighted deep problems in the financial sector. The longer-term challenge of building a more diversified, innovative economy is unresolved. And environmental and sustainability risks, led by climate change, are starting to hit home on public and private balance sheets and in the public consciousness. Twenty seven years of growth is a fine achievement. But what if Australia – like many other countries – has been too focused on the rate of economic growth, and not on its direction? All the activity is great, but where is it getting the land down under? Understanding how to move the Australian economy in a smart, green direction requires the same bold thinking about design, infrastructure, and public realm that the Icebergs pool brings to mind. I am meeting Australian policymakers, business people, civil society groups and academics this week to discuss how to build a smarter, more equitable and sustainable economy. My key message at Tuesday’s John Menadue Oration at Carriageworks in Sydney was that this requires freeing policymakers from the straightjacket of thinking that the best they can do is pick up the mess created by unfettered markets. The narrow training public choice theory provides often means civil servants think government failures are worse than market failures. The tool kit that emerges from that thinking is not fit-for-purpose for 21st century challenges. As I argued in The Entrepreneurial State, the defining leaps forward in our living memories – whether in medicine, computers, energy or nanotechnology – were often made possible by the state acting as an investor of first resort, investing in the high-risk capital-intensive areas that allowed business to see new opportunities. Indeed, most of the tech in your pocket, those things that make your smart phones smart – the internet, touch screens, GPS, Siri – were originally the product of government research and innovation, much of it stemming back to government-led Cold War “missions” in space travel or defence. Australia’s scientific research organisation, the CSIRO, made its own contribution here through its work on the Wifi technology that millions of these devices use. In each case the technology emerged as a solution to a problem. But rather than military problems, we should be asking how today’s “wicked” problems around inequality, climate and health can provide urgency to find new solutions, spurring cross-sectoral investments and bottom-up solutions. My work with the European Union and policymakers around the world argues for a “mission-oriented” approach where states lead ambitious responses to these major challenges and opportunities. Missions are about collaboration – while public policy sets the direction, they create frameworks for different actors, sectors and disciplines to work towards socially-oriented goals – and better directions for economic growth. Think affordable, sustainable energy for Australian households, or making Australia a net renewable energy exporter, or halting Australia’s extinction crisis, or leading a global sustainable finance agenda. These are ambitious, but achievable, targets. Mobilising activity towards each of them would have major positive economic, scientific and social spillovers. And they would all help make Australia a country that has even more to be proud of apart from its steadily-increasing GDP. Delivering on missions requires major investment, including in the capability of the public sector to set a clear direction. This means new licence to make direct investments and take risks, new ways of evaluating policy proposals, new forms of partnerships with other actors—including the ability to listen and harness the demands coming from social movements. Indeed, finding a way for different stakeholders to come together in a trusted setting to co-create missions can potentially bring back trust in the political process to deliver real value to people’s lives. As I argue in The Value of Everything, we should also consider how to reform the financial sector, which needs to find a clearer relationship with the real economy, to fuel capital investment and innovation rather than be a speculative sector obsessed with itself. We should not underestimate the new tools required, including those that the Treasury uses to evaluate public investments, which are too often encumbered by static cost benefit analysis that would have killed any mission from the start. Also needed is a new sense of confidence in the state’s ability to deliver, and commensurate investment in skills, capabilities, and people in the public sector. Learning organisations, able to explore and experiment require internal investments—less outsourcing to think tanks and consultants. This is not easy, but one thing my visit has reinforced is that Australians don’t shy away from a challenge. In fact, as research by my hosts the Centre for Policy Development shows, Australians might be uniquely up for the task of rebuilding the effectiveness of their democracy. Already, you have major institutions making a big difference. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation, now the largest state green bank in the world, is one leading example of a public institution playing a critical role in Australia’s clean energy innovation system and emissions reduction. Australia’s public servants also played a pivotal role in drafting and shaping the global Sustainable Development Goals, from which a whole set of Australian “moonshots” could be chosen. The stakes are high, but so is the appetite for change. As an election year looms, it is time Australians think more about where they want their economy to take them, and demand that their next government has the courage to lead the way.

2018-09-27T08:00:15Z,Are we finally waking up to the threat from the world’s deadliest infectious disease? | Nick Herbert,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/27/worlds-deadliest-infectious-disease-tuberculosis-tb,"Imagine if the World Health Organization announced that a new, highly infectious airborne disease would claim 1.6 million lives over the next year. With no vaccine and a lengthy treatment regimen, the development of lethal, drug-resistant strains of the bug would be a serious risk. Of course, the world’s leaders would be galvanised into action immediately. This is not really fiction, however. It describes a disease that is as old as humankind: tuberculosis. In the 19th century, “consumption” was the leading cause of death in the west. The combination of better housing and Alexander Fleming’s accidental discovery of antibiotics in 1928 transformed the situation. The world believed TB was beaten. But it was never eradicated, and in the 1980s TB flared up again, on the back of the Aids epidemic. Striking opportunistically when the body’s resistance is low, it is the most common cause of death among people with Aids. TB was declared a Global Health Emergency in 1993. In the 25 years since then, nearly 50 million people have died. Today TB kills more people than Aids and malaria combined: it is the world’s deadliest infectious disease. Why have global leaders been so slow to react? Because TB is a disease of the poor. Until recently, no new medicines for TB treatment had been approved for over 40 years. The bug is still treated with antibiotics, which are taken over a period of months, and vaccine development has been critically underfunded. The Sustainable Development Goals agreed by the world’s leaders four years ago commit to ending the Aids, malaria and TB epidemics by 2030. Yet at the current rate of progress TB will not be beaten for over a century. The Global Fund was set up to fight TB as well as malaria and Aids, and it provides two-thirds of all international financing for tuberculosis, yet the share of TB spend within the fund is disproportionately low. Doctors know how to treat TB: we’re just refusing to pay for it. This isn’t a medical problem – it’s a shameful political failure. Today the United Nations will convene the first High-Level Meeting on TB, which will be attended by heads of state or government. The draft declaration calls for an “urgent global response” and reaffirms the commitment to end the epidemic by 2030. There are three reasons why it is imperative to act now. First, the humanitarian case. It is scandalous that 30 million people will die needlessly over the next 15 years when the disease has been easily and cheaply curable for over half a century. As progress has been made in fighting Aids and malaria, the failure to tackle TB has been revealed in plain sight. Our consciences should not allow that to stand. The second reason to act is economic. Millions of sick people are an impediment to economic development in some of the world’s poorest countries. The failure to tackle TB by 2030 will cost the global economy $1 trillion. TB treatments are amongst the most cost-effective health interventions, and a relatively small boost in research and development to fight the disease could save billions of dollars in later years. The third reason to act is to ensure global health security. Drug-resistant tuberculosis accounts for one-third of deaths due to antimicrobial resistance globally. As the UN declaration this week notes, if we fail to address this, “the grave individual and public health risks posed by multidrug-resistant tuberculosis are cause for alarm”. Only a quarter of multidrug-resistant TB cases are being diagnosed and notified. The already heavy economic toll of TB would pale by comparison with the cost of unchecked drug resistance. The UN declaration says all the right things. Resources should be increased, public health systems strengthened, and research and development boosted. Significantly, it includes a new commitment to the rapid scaling up of access to testing, so that at least 40 million people will be diagnosed and treated by 2022. Currently one in three people with the disease – and 71% of people with drug-resistant TB – are “missing”. If the new treatment target is met it will at last break the back of the epidemic. But will it be met? Such ambitious proposals will be achieved only if every country delivers its share of the target. The key question will be how the declaration is translated into action. There is no mechanism to hold leaders to account for delivering on the promises, beyond the existing framework set by the World Health Organisation. Frankly, if that was effective we would not be so off track now. As little as two years ago TB simply wasn’t on the political radar. It has risen rapidly up the agenda since then, with declarations at the G7 and G20, and a summit of health ministers in Moscow last year. The announcement by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, earlier this year of an ambitious new plan to beat TB in his country was seen as a milestone in the fight. This week’s UN meeting has the potential to be a turning point. Thirty heads of government will attend the meeting – but many countries will merely send a minister. Europe will be particularly poorly represented. Of course, global leaders face many other challenges, but a disease that is killing more than 4,000 people a day should no longer be ignored. Still, every country will be signed up, so what will matter is what governments actually do when the ink on the declaration is dry. As the failure of the declaration of TB as a global health emergency a quarter of a century ago has shown us, words are not enough. We must demand that governments translate today’s promises into action. • Nick Herbert MP is co-chairman of the Global TB Caucus",Tuberculosis; Health; Society; World news; Aids and HIV; World Health Organization; Sustainable development goals; Global development; UK news; United Nations; Drug resistance,Opinion
2018-05-11T16:01:23Z,Disabled people facing government hostility in the UK | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/11/disabled-people-facing-government-hostility-in-the-uk,"The British public have reacted to “a sense of betrayal of that so-called British value of fairness” (The hostile environment? Britain’s disabled people live there too, theguardian.com, 26 April). This “sense of betrayal” was only possible because the national press reported the plight of the Windrush scandal, but this is not always the case. Some of the press were happy to promote the exaggerated claims of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) which, during five years of coalition government, knowingly misled the public regarding “fake” claimants of disability benefit. Coincidentally, disability hate crimes increased by 213% during the coalition’s term in office. Influenced by a US healthcare insurance “consultant”, who funded DWP-commissioned research used to justify welfare reforms, the work capability assessment (WCA) adopted the bio-psychosocial model of assessment which has failed all academic scrutiny. The WCA is used by the DWP to resist access to the employment and support allowance (ESA) sickness and disability benefit, which is the financial equivalent of jobseeker’s allowance, so there is no financial incentive when claiming ESA. This DWP assessment totally disregards diagnosis, prognosis, past medical history and all medical opinion. Deaths of genuine claimants were always inevitable. There is a reason why the DWP has refused to publish updated ESA mortality totals since February 2014, as suicides linked to the ESA assessment climb. It’s time for this ideological DWP tyranny to end, and for the national press to stop disregarding another national atrocity impacting on disabled people.

Poor vision, the world’s largest unaddressed disability, prevents children from seeing the classroom blackboard, traps families in poverty and entrenches gender inequality. The UN’s sustainable development goals look unachievable without tackling it. For those without glasses suffering from refractive error, the personal cost can be huge. The global annual bill in health costs and lost productivity is estimated at $3tn. But reducing the number of traffic accidents and increasing labour participation is the responsibility of insurers, employers, governments and, of course, eyewear manufacturers.

2018-04-22T15:29:48Z,Head of EBRD hopes to expand into sub-Saharan Africa,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/22/head-of-ebrd-hopes-to-expand-into-sub-saharan-africa,"A bank originally set up to help countries of the former Soviet bloc is poised to extend its operations into sub-Saharan Africa in order to speed up progress in meeting ambitious development goals set by the United Nations. Sir Suma Chakrabarti, the president of the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said his organisation had the money and the expertise to stimulate the growth of strong private sectors in some of the world’s poorest countries. Speaking to the Guardian in Washington, Chakrabarti expressed enthusiasm for expansion into sub-Saharan Africa if the member governments that own the bank gave the go-ahead. “Our shareholders need to start a debate about whether they want us to add to our capacity”, he said. “We have increased our geographical reach – to Mongolia, then Turkey, then the Middle East and north Africa, then Greece and Cyprus. “The biggest gap is sub-Saharan Africa. The biggest need there is private sector development which is what we do. If we get involved, we need to do so gradually and incrementally. Countries we work with must have a commitment to democracy and market economics.” With the EBRD prevented from lending to Russia since the start of the Ukraine crisis in 2014, Chakrabarti said the EBRD had all the capital it needed and could increase its lending by €2.5-3bn a year. The World Bank and the African Development Bank already operate in sub-Saharan Africa, but Chakrabarti said he did not envisage a turf war if the EBRD joined them. “There is so much to do. The African Development Bank was the biggest cheerleader for us to extend into north Africa and has said it would welcome us with open arms because there is a need for a strong private sector.” He said the EBRD’s business model was successful because it employed local staff, with only the mission heads non-nationals, adding that the UK government should be celebrating his bank as an example of the global Britain it wants to create after Brexit. Along with the International Maritime Organisaton, the EBRD is one of only two multilateral bodies based in London. Chakrabarti said India would soon join China as a shareholder in the bank, which had a strong development policy focus and attracted talented people from around the world. It is successful and it is profitable “We need to recognise the importance to the UK of this organisation. It is a good news story for Britain.” Chakrabarti said the international community needed to do more if the UN’s 2030 sustainable development goals – 17 targets including eliminating poverty and providing universal quality education – were going to be met. “It is worrying that everyone has willed the objectives but not the means. Business as usual is not going to get us there.” The World Bank announced on Saturday an agreement to increase its capital by $13bn following protracted talks with the US Treasury. Chakrabarti said the agreement was good in itself, but added that it was also encouraging that the US was engaged with the multilateral system.",Economics; Africa; Global economy; Global development; World Bank; International Monetary Fund (IMF); Business; UK news; World news,Business
2018-09-21T09:02:24Z,Fighting the world's deadliest infectious disease: how to tackle TB,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/21/tuberculosis-tb-fighting-worlds-deadliest-infectious-disease,"It is the world’s deadliest infectious disease, killing almost 2 million people a year – more than HIV and malaria combined – but the fight against tuberculosis (TB) is still severely underfunded and neglected by politicians and decision-makers, experts warn. TB is both preventable and curable, but remains a significant public health risk and caused more than 10 million people to fall ill in 2016. This month, the United Nations general assembly will hold the first high-level meeting on the TB crisis, putting a spotlight on the disease 25 years after it was declared a global emergency. Ahead of the event, the Guardian held a roundtable discussion with experts in the field, chaired by health editor Sarah Boseley and supported by the Stop TB Partnership, to discuss the barriers to fighting the disease. It is inextricably linked with poverty, with more than 95% of deaths from TB taking place in low- and middle-income countries, which is why action has so far been “inadequate”, said Peter Sands, executive director of the Global Fund to fight Aids, TB and Malaria. “Most people in places with money and power don’t think about TB at all,” he said. “People think TB was something sorted out a long time ago. Because they don’t have much resourcing for it, very few politicians are making courageous decisions.” “There’s a lack of political will, and it’s exacerbated by the fact that TB is a disease of the poor,” said Nick Herbert, MP for Arundel and South Downs and co-chair of the all party parliamentary group on global TB and the Global TB Caucus. Research has found programmes to tackle poverty could be just as effective in the fight against TB as medicines and vaccines. Bill Lynn, a clinician for London North West University NHS healthcare trust, and Ruth Sherratt, senior international programme officer at TB Alert, both noted the complex social and economic factors driving the problem. “It is a disease linked with poverty, and populations that are physically, socially and culturally hard to reach,” said Sherratt. “We need to make sure the funding addresses those issues as well.” Reaching those with the disease is even a significant barrier in the UK. Lynn Altass, national TB strategy programme manager for NHS England, pointed out that much of the population with TB in England are migrants and even though they may have been here for years, they still don’t know how to access the healthcare system. Hostile environment policies also discourage people from coming forward. An important way to raise awareness among the public and politicians is to show the widespread impact on society. “TB impacts economies of countries, it affects men at the most active age, it impacts the money part of the economy, the families,” said Lucica Ditiu, executive director of Stop TB Partnership. Although financing for care and prevention has increased over the last decade, there remains a funding gap – $2.3bn (£1.74bn) in 2017. The biggest donor, the Global Fund to fight Aids, TB and Malaria, allocates just 18% of its resources to the disease. “Underlying it is, frankly, a lack of resources,” said Sands. “We need to expand the funding envelope and get countries to take TB seriously in terms of domestic priorities … but we’ll get more money as a result of success and political visibility.” The funding gaps affect progress in developing technologies to tackle TB. Francis Drobniewski, professor of global health and tuberculosis at Imperial College London, said there was a lack of sufficient cheap and effective point of care diagnostics. Els Torreele, executive director of Médecins Sans Frontières’ access campaign, added there has been a dearth of research and development (R&amp;D) over many years for adequate tools for diagnosis and treatment. In the last few years, bedaquiline (a bacterial drug belonging to a new class of antibiotics) has been released to treat patients with drug-resistant TB. “Before bedaquiline, the last drug we developed was before we put a man on the moon,” said Aaron Oxley, executive director of Results UK. “Unfortunately in TB – or fortunately now – things are about to get more expensive because we’re getting tools that actually work.” But Torreele disagreed that there is always a correlation between expense and things that work. “It goes back to how we are financing R&amp;D, and who gets to benefit,” she said, calling for more accountability of pharmaceutical companies and for non-governmental organisations and campaigners work together to press for cheaper tools. Governments should also be held to account, and the upcoming UN high-level meeting is “the start of a process that should lock governments into concerted action”, Sands said. Herbert hopes to continue holding governments to account at the next Global TB Caucus, which brings together global parliamentarians. He noted the attendance from European heads of government, including the UK, has been disappointing. Nevertheless, 2018 has already seen a significant shift in the fight against TB. Prime minister Narendra Modi launched a campaign to eliminate TB in India by 2025 – five years before the target set in the sustainable development goals. The plan focuses on a patient-centred approach, reaching undiagnosed TB in at-risk populations, and TB patients seeking care from private providers. There are other positive projects taking place worldwide. Aamir Khan, executive director of IRD Global, led a zero TB city initiative in Pakistan, making a vital people-centric approach to tackling the disease. “The key element is to think of TB approach in terms of a social movement,” he said, as a large problem is stigma and people not coming forward with symptoms. In one programme, IRD Global engaged 40,000 schoolgirls in how to look for TB, encouraging them to look for signs in 10 houses neighbouring theirs. In one month, these girls referred 50,000 individuals to testing sites, he said. Phumeza Tisile, a TB survivor from South Africa who was diagnosed when a student in 2010, said the public and decision makers are not hearing from the right voices, and that the media, in particular, doesn’t “publish the stories celebrating if someone got cured”. She added: “All you see is death in the stories. That doesn’t encourage people to speak about it.” At the table Sarah Boseley (chair) health editor, the Guardian Lynn Altass, national TB strategy programme manager, NHS England/Public Health England Lucica Ditiu, executive director, Stop TB Partnership Francis Drobniewski, Professor of Global Health and Tuberculosis, Imperial College, London Nick Herbert, MP for Arundel and South Downs and co-chair of the all party parliamentary group on global TB and the Global TB Caucus Aamir Khan, executive director, IRD Global Bill Lynn, clinician, London NW University NHS healthcare trust Aaron Oxley, executive director, Results UK Peter Sands, executive director, the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria Ruth Sherratt, senior international programme officer, TB Alert Phumeza Tisile, South African TB ambassador Els Torreele, executive director, Médecins Sans Frontières’ access campaign • Roundtable supported by the Stop TB Partnership.

2018-09-19T13:39:27Z,All those who are displaced by crisis and conflict need help and protection | Letter,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/19/all-those-who-are-displaced-by-crisis-and-conflict-need-help-and-protection,"We, leaders of faith and religious organisations, groups and communities, including those supporting the Charter for Faith-Based Humanitarian Action, are compelled by our faiths to come together to speak out for those most marginalised. All faiths and religions actively encourage the recognition and support of those most in need and are uniquely placed to respond. Many of us live near, or are part of, populations affected by crisis, and enjoy special relationships of trust with as well as insights into and access to our communities beyond those of non-faith actors. We are present before crises occur and are key providers of assistance and protection both during them and afterwards. We can no longer stand by as the number of people forced from their homes but who have not crossed a border continues to rise in the wake of protracted crises and climate change. Currently there are more than 65 million people displaced due to conflict and violence, and 40.5 million of these remain in their countries of origin. It would take more than a year to read all their names. Millions more are displaced due to climate-related events and disasters. We call on leaders of national governments to do more to ensure that the needs and rights of internally displaced people are addressed and upheld. We stand in solidarity with people who have fled their homes but not crossed borders; many of them are the poorest and most vulnerable in their communities, including women, children, elderly and disabled people, yet so often they receive none of the support and protection to which refugees are entitled. Displaced on average for 15 years, often repeatedly, most exist without access to basic services such as health and education, are often subjected to abuse, torture and harassment and face despair. Our faiths compel us to speak out against the disregard of their human rights, their marginalisation, and the stripping of their dignity. We are united in calling on governments to work with UN agencies, INGOs, civil society and faith communities to prevent displacement in the first place, to protect those who are displaced, and to work with people forced to flee to find durable solutions. In this 20th anniversary year of the UN guiding principles on internal displacement, it is time to lay the ground for bold action in support of a FAIR deal (Funded, Ambitious, Inclusive and Respectful of international law) for people forced to flee within their country of origin. The global compacts on refugees and migration, to be signed this year, regrettably provide scant attention to the ignored millions, forced out of their homes but still within their countries of origin. If we are to realise the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and ensure we “leave no one behind”, then the international community must ensure that internally displaced people receive the protection and support that they so desperately need. We therefore encourage leaders of national governments – together with local partners, civil society, faith communities and the private sector, as well as humanitarian and development actors – to join the GP20 plan of action to prevent further forcible displacement of people, strengthen the protection of those who are displaced, and seek long-lasting and durable solutions with them. We call on national leaders to consider their commitments to the SDGs and those made at the world humanitarian summit to ensure that nobody is left behind and that everyone, including the millions of internally displaced people so often overlooked, has access to adequate protection and assistance in line with their inherent dignity and worth.

2018-08-31T15:30:47Z,The importance of ethical aid to Africa | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/31/the-importance-of-ethical-aid-to-africa,"It’s disappointing that Theresa May appeared to miss a major opportunity this week, when boosting trade with Nigeria (Report, 30 August). The UK should also be encouraging increased investment of Nigerian government revenue towards cutting-cases and deaths from easily preventable diseases like malaria, and boosting health systems. Nigeria has the highest malaria death burden in the world, with more than 100,000 people losing their lives last year. Children under five and pregnant women are at particularly high risk. It is impossible to separate the issue of trade from the issue of healthier nations, when malaria traps people in poverty, prevents children from attending school and costs Africa more than £8bn and as much as 1.3% of GDP every year in the worst affected countries. The Commonwealth heads of government meeting earlier this year made an important pledge to halve malaria in the Commonwealth by 2023 and put the world on a path toward ending this deadly disease. UK aid and leadership has a vital role to play. As the UK continues as Commonwealth chair-in-office for the next 18 months, the government has important opportunities to push for bolder action to tackle malaria with Commonwealth counterparts. It must use them. Catherine West MP Labour MP for Hornsey and Wood Green; vice-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on malaria • The PM’s visit to Africa was well timed. Africa continues to be the poorest continent in the world with 47% of people living on $1.90 or less a day. Poverty is actually rising in the three countries May has been visiting this week – and these are some of the richer ones in Africa. Yes, economic growth is an integral part of international development. But for the PM to deliver her promises on the sustainable development goals (SDGs), and economic growth for all, she must genuinely commit to lifting the barriers that prevent people from escaping poverty, allowing them to seize economic opportunities. This means not binding British aid to our post-Brexit economic needs, and ensuring it is wholeheartedly aimed at those most in need – without the expectation of receiving anything in return. The PM is right. Foreign aid works. But aid that prioritises economic development at whatever cost to the environment or the world’s poorest people doesn’t work, and time and time again research and evidence have proven this point. Moves towards using the aid budget more favourably for businesses rather than the poorest and most marginalised risk exacerbating poverty and inequality. For aid to help boost economic growth we need transparent and principled investment, where companies embrace their wider responsibilities to the societies in which they operate. This must include ensuring women’s economic empowerment and inclusion of those with disabilities in the workforce, as well as green and decent jobs. Claire Godfrey Head of policy and campaigns, Bond (which represents 450 of the UK’s international development NGOs) • Theresa May is right to say the UK should be immensely proud of its record on aid and development cooperation. And, in particular, proud to be the only G7 country to achieve and maintain the longstanding 0.7% GNI target for aid. The PM is also correct in saying that aid works and that using our development spending to combat extreme poverty and other global challenges is furthering the UK’s vital national interests. As our development programme is reoriented to deliver even better on the pledge of a global economy that works for everyone, the UK should build on its record on transparency and commitment to accountability. It should lead a new effort to encourage every government, every business and every NGO to measure exactly how it is delivering for the poorest 20%. The PM points to growing inequality in and between countries and to citizens’ fears that they will be left behind. As she recommits the UK to delivering on the SDGs, it is worth emphasising that SDG 10 on reducing inequality requires faster-than-average growth for the poorest. This is vital if we are to help close the still-growing gap between rich and poor. Some will argue that an aid programme that works for the UK is incompatible with aid that helps the poorest. But the Department for International Development’s record, plus the external scrutiny of the OECD development assistance committee and the UK International Development Act, provide additional safeguards on the poverty focus of UK aid. But these backstops would be greatly enhanced if DfID insisted that every department and every organisation spending UK aid gathers disaggregated data on exactly how benefits are distributed across the population (are the poorest 20% getting a fair share?). It is time to get beyond simple assertions of commitment to inclusive growth – and actually measure how rights, services, goods, and opportunities are being delivered to every citizen. Judith Randel and Tony German Evercreech, Somerset • I can’t help feeling there is something bitterly ironic about Theresa May’s trip to Africa. After centuries of British colonial exploitation and imperialistic policy she is now going cap in hand to those same people in the hope that they will help us out of a gigantic mess of our own making – a mess that arguably has significant roots in post-colonial attitudes. Who could blame any of them if they politely but firmly told her to go away. Ken Abbott Portishead, Somerset • Does Theresa May think that all Africans will simply forget that she appointed a blatantly racist foreign secretary (Boris Johnson)? Does May think that her embarrassing shuffling will cause black Africans to forget that while she was home secretary she was responsible for the racist miasma that led to the Windrush scandal ruining the lives of the descendants of African slaves who came to Britain in the 50s and 60s?

2018-05-23T06:00:16Z,Home Office under fire over ‘muddled’ strategy on slavery that fails victims,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/may/23/home-office-muddled-strategy-modern-slavery-kevin-hyland,"Anti-trafficking campaigners have accused the Home Office of a “muddled and inconsistent” strategy over modern slavery that is failing its victims, following the resignation of Britain’s first anti-slavery commissioner. Kevin Hyland, appointed by Theresa May when she was home secretary, stepped down last week after nearly four years in the role as champion of her flagship policy to make prosecutions easier and protect victims of modern slavery, citing government interference. His move comes amid growing criticism of the government’s approach to this complex crime. Earlier this month, a parliamentary committee said modern slavery was not fully understood by the government and that it could not establish whether its strategy was working. On Monday, MPs said traffickers were “winning” as they described vulnerable women being exploited on an “industrial scale” by trafficking gangs in the UK in pop-up brothels. In a letter of resignation to the prime minister last week, Hyland said he was leaving with a “heavy heart”. He praised May’s leadership on the issue but said that independence had felt “somewhat discretionary from the Home Office rather than legally bestowed”. Hyland, formerly head of the Metropolitan police’s human trafficking unit, was recently exonerated after an investigation into a complaint of alleged professional misconduct by an NGO. The Home Office found he had no case to answer. Hyland has previously spoken out over Britain’s failure to support victims, as well as on “sub-standard” data recording and intelligence-gathering, and very low prosecution rates. Groups representing victims of trafficking and slavery echoed concerns about the independence of the role. “The government introduced the Modern Slavery Act, which is a positive thing,” said Aidan McQuade, the former director of Anti-Slavery International. “But it ignores the effect of the hostile environment, it ignores that it established quotas for deportation and it ignores that the 2016 Immigration Act created the offence of illegal working, when a lot of people trafficked to the UK have been illegally working. “We don’t see a consistent policy approach to modern slavery across the UK. It is a muddled policy. At its core, there is a failure to understand that it is a human rights issue rather than a criminal justice issue.” He said Hyland had worked to get modern slavery recognised within the sustainable development goals, as well as in other government departments. “Broadly, his approach has been more diligent and more imaginative than I think the role was initially, which was as a criminal justice role.” McQuade said the next commissioner would have to have a strong reputation for independence. “Someone … perhaps at a more senior level, such as a chief constable or a judge, or senior barrister, could bolster the perception of the role.” One of the difficulties for the commissioner, campaigners said, was a provision written into the Modern Slavery Act permitting the home secretary to redact or omit details from reports, prior to publication, under certain circumstances. This could happen if the report was against the national interest, would jeopardise national security or compromise an investigation or prosecution. Caroline Robinson, director of Focus on Labour Exploitation (Flex), said Hyland had been frustrated in the role. “I don’t think it’s any secret, for instance, that he was trying to fight for the national referral mechanism [the process by which someone is recognised as a victim of modern slavery] to be reformed, and, in our view, very little was taken into account.”Nick Grono, the CEO of the Freedom Fund, said Hyland had been an “outstanding” and respected commissioner. He was disappointed to see him go, he said. Andrew Wallis, the CEO of anti-trafficking organisation Unseen, which runs a helpline for victims, said the post was no less independent than that of other commissioners, in that they are appointed by, and report to, a government department. Wallis said: “Kevin was critical of a lot of things. He was critical of policing and that fed into the Home Office. If he wasn’t independent then that criticism would have been quashed.” Hyland will begin a new job as the chief executive of ChildFund Ireland, an international development agency, later in the summer. He will retain a number of senior leadership positions within the modern slavery arena on boards as chairperson or senior adviser, both in the UK and internationally.",Global development; Migration and development; Slavery; World news; Sustainable development goals; Human rights,Global development
2018-05-06T15:08:08Z,Rotten results: Sainsbury's drops project to halve food waste,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/06/rotten-results-sainburys-drops-project-to-halve-food-waste,"Sainsbury’s has abandoned a £10m project to halve food waste in a designated town across Britain after a year-long trial produced miserable results. The supermarket group gave families in one town, Swadlincote in south Derbyshire, free gadgets to cut food waste – such as devices to measure the correct amount of spaghetti to cook, “smart” fridges to control content and temperatures more accurately, food planners and magnetic shopping lists – and monitored the results. However, the year-long experiment fell far short of its 50% target, with households believed to have cut food waste by only 9% – and telling Sainsbury’s the issue was not a priority for them. The £10m Waste Less, Save More programme was launched in 2015 to find out why consumers throw so much edible food away, with £1m spent on an “experimental testbed” in Swadlincote. The market town beat 188 areas in the UK to be awarded the project and Sainsbury’s had planned to spend £10m over five years to develop a network of similar schemes across the UK. But the UK’s second-largest supermarket has pulled the plug on further funding, halfway through the process of giving cash to successful regional bidders. The Waste Less, Save More slogan and branding have been dropped and all the retailer’s work on food waste will be absorbed into a wider “wellbeing” campaign. The results of the evaluation by the environmental charity Hubbub revealed that the Swadlincote project had achieved only a single-digit percentage reduction (which has not been officially published but is believed to be 9%). Hubbub waded through nearly 800 household food collection bins weighing their contents and comparing them after the trial ended. The Guardian revealed last March that the project was unlikely to hit the original target and that Sainsbury’s has gone back to the drawing board to re-evaluate the scheme. The government’s waste advisory body, Wrap, was monitoring the Swadlincote project. The UK churns out 15m tonnes of food waste a year – of which 7m comes from households. The estimated retail value of this waste is put at £7.5bn – Wrap believes a typical family wastes £700 of food each year. “We launched Waste Less, Save More three years ago,” Sainsbury’s said. “We found our customers’ priorities have changed and broadened, which is why reducing food waste now forms one part of what is an even bigger investment to help our customers ‘live well’ in every aspect of their lives.” Sainsbury’s said it would continue to operate shared surplus food projects and to donate surplus food to charity through hundreds of partnerships across the UK, while any food unsuitable for human consumption would be turned into animal feed or sent for anaerobic digestion, which leads to biogas. Sainsbury’s insisted the decision was not related to the merger plans with Asda. Free and low-cost solutions offered in Swadlincote included community events and schools programmes through to larger initiatives such as “community” fridges – a fridge in a public space in which people can put in food or take out food. A rival supermarket chain is expected to provide funding for a growing national network of such fridges. Supermarkets are regularly criticised for not doing more to redistribute edible food to the needy – via food banks and charities – although Sainsbury’s points out it co-founded FareShare in 1994 with the homelessness charity Crisis and supported its launch as an independent charity in 2004. Wrap declined to comment. However, Clare Oxborrow, a senior food and farming campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “For too long the supply chain ignored this and now we have an entrenched problem to get to grips with. Food that is wasted has taken fresh water, land, energy and labour to produce and supermarkets need to show their customers the scale of the problem, and why efforts to reduce food waste deserves ongoing support. “All companies along the supply chain should publicise their food waste data and commit to concerted, long-term action, so that food waste is halved by 2030, as set out in the sustainable development goals.”",J Sainsbury; Retail industry; Supermarkets; Business; Food & drink industry; Food; Food waste; Environment; Life and style; UK news,Business
2018-07-16T06:00:29Z,Oil-rich Nigeria outstrips India as country with most people in poverty,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jul/16/oil-rich-nigeria-outstrips-india-most-people-in-poverty,"Nigeria, one of Africa’s two wealthiest economies, has overtaken India as home to the world’s greatest concentration of extreme poverty, amid warnings that the continent will host nine out of 10 of the world’s poorest people within 12 years. The claim comes as concerns mount that the growth in poverty – and in Africa in particular – is outpacing efforts to eradicate it. It was made in a recent paper for the Brookings Institution thinktank, by three experts associated with the World Poverty Clock – launched in 2017 to track trends in poverty reduction. According to the authors, energy-rich Nigeria overtook India in May to become the country with the world’s highest number of people – 87 million – living in extreme poverty, in comparison with India’s 73 million people. The report says 14 of the 18 countries in the world where the number of people in extreme poverty is rising are in Africa. The Democratic Republic of the Congo, currently ranked third, is also expected to overtake India soon. Previously the ambition of eradicating extreme poverty – the first of the UN’s 17 sustainable development goals, adopted by world leaders at a historic summit in September 2015 – had been lauded as a success story. Trajectories for poverty in African countries have already been raising concerns among policymakers over issues as diverse as stability and security, and migration trends, already a serious concern in Europe. Inevitably the claims have prompted sharp differences of opinion in Nigeria, where assessing poverty figures is a political issue. In a hard-hitting editorial last week, the Punch daily newspaper noted the rise in poverty since 2010. “For a country that is so richly blessed, Nigeria’s poverty narrative is an embarrassment to both the citizens and outsiders.” However, the Brookings report has not come as a surprise to keen observers of events in Nigeria after the World Bank had earlier warned of growing poverty in the country. “Back in February, the African Development Bank had said that 152 million Nigerians, representing almost 80% of the country’s estimated 193.3 million population, lived on less than $2 per day.” However, Nigeria’s trade, industry and investment minister, Okechukwu Enelamah, suggested the figures reflected a period when Nigeria was in recession. “I think first we need to understand … there are reports that are lagging in indicators, which means people are reporting on history,” he said, adding that he hoped Nigeria’s economic policies would lead to a reduction in poverty. The figures, say the report’s authors, mark a profound change in the pervading narrative of global poverty – and where it is concentrated – throwing up challenges for the international community. They show the number of extreme poor in India is declining at a rate of about 44 people a minute, compared with Nigeria, where it has been rising by six people a minute. Homi Kharas, one of the Brookings authors who helped set up the World Poverty Clock, noted that the clock was intended as a device to dramatise the rate of poverty reduction required to end extreme poverty by 2030. “It gives you the speed, not the level of poverty reduction, and the world has been going happily along celebrating the fact that a lot of people are coming out of poverty,” he told the Guardian. “But the fact is the speed is not only less than required, but it is not doing well, particularly in Africa.” Kharas points out that while population growth in India is dropping even as it enjoys economic development, in African countries the opposite is true. “Africa has the fastest growing population of any major region, while population growth in India is probably under 1%. In Africa, however, a slow combination of population growth, conflict, economic and social problems, and bad government and bad governance has led to the current situation.” On the specific issue of Nigeria, Kharas added: “Nigeria is a rich country but because much of its wealth comes from the production and sale of oil, it doesn’t directly go to the pockets of ordinary people.” For those struggling with poverty in Nigeria, the issues are more visceral. Mohammed Ahmed, 33, is an Islamic teacher and father of four from Abuja. He says that once he has paid for his children’s school expenses there is barely enough to feed the family. “My salary is 20,000 naira per month (£40). Even though school is free, we still need to pay examination fees and other costs. I go to the market to buy food every day. I spent about N400-500 to feed eight people every day because I have other relatives living with me. It is very tough but I try to feed my family twice a day.” The shift in the centre of global poverty from Asia to Africa is no surprise to Andrew Shepherd, director of the Chronic Poverty Advisory Network at the Overseas Development Institute, whose group noted the trend several years ago. “Broadly speaking I would agree that there is a shift from Asia to Africa, although it is probably slower than some people think.” Shepherd added that the situation appears to be exacerbated in African countries by features less visible in many Asian countries, including questions of poor governance, harsher effects of climate change and conflict. “I think it is shifting to states that are conflict-affected and states most affected by climate change – and there is quite a correlation between the two – and states that have both poor policies and are significantly underfunded and in terms of aid. There is a whole bunch of these states and a significant number are in Africa.”",Inequality and development; Global development; Poverty; Nigeria; India; Africa; South and central Asia; Environmental sustainability; Society; World news,Global development
2018-07-16T12:57:15Z,Buzzwords and tortuous impact studies won't fix a broken aid system | 15 leading economists,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jul/16/buzzwords-crazes-broken-aid-system-poverty,"Development efforts over the past few decades have not been as effective as promised. Global poverty remains intractable: more than 4 billion people live on less than the equivalent of $5 (£3.80) a day, and the number of people going hungry has been rising. Important gains have been made in some areas, but many of the objectives set by the millennium development goals – to be reached by 2015 – remain unfulfilled. And this despite hundreds of billions of dollars of aid. Donors increasingly want to see more impact for their money, practitioners are searching for ways to make their projects more effective, and politicians want more financial accountability behind aid budgets. One popular option has been to audit projects for results. The argument is that assessing “aid effectiveness” – a buzzword now ubiquitous in the UK’s Department for International Development – will help decide what to focus on. Some go so far as to insist that development interventions should be subjected to the same kind of randomised control trials used in medicine, with “treatment” groups assessed against control groups. Such trials are being rolled out to evaluate the impact of a wide variety of projects – everything from water purification tablets to microcredit schemes, financial literacy classes to teachers’ performance bonuses. Economist Esther Duflo at MIT’s Poverty Action Lab recently argued in Le Monde that France should adopt clinical trials as a guiding principle for its aid budget, which has grown significantly under the Macron administration. But truly random sampling with blinded subjects is almost impossible in human communities without creating scenarios so abstract as to tell us little about the real world. And trials are expensive to carry out, and fraught with ethical challenges – especially when it comes to health-related interventions. (Who gets the treatment and who doesn’t?) But the real problem with the “aid effectiveness” craze is that it narrows our focus down to micro-interventions at a local level that yield results that can be observed in the short term. At first glance this approach might seem reasonable and even beguiling. But it tends to ignore the broader macroeconomic, political and institutional drivers of impoverishment and underdevelopment. Aid projects might yield satisfying micro-results, but they generally do little to change the systems that produce the problems in the first place. What we need instead is to tackle the real root causes of poverty, inequality and climate change. Handing out performance bonuses to teachers, for example, is an inadequate response to education budgets that have been slashed in order to pay down onerous external debts. As the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights argued in his recent report, social protections need to be ringfenced against fiscal adjustment. The most fragile members of the population need more than classes in financial literacy. They need robust, universal services and access to public education and healthcare. Water purification tablets are too little in the face of droughts induced by climate change; what is at stake is an ecological emergency that demands coordinated public policy strategies. In agriculture, real progress requires putting an end to the excessive subsidies paid by rich nations to large producers, regulating food commodity derivatives markets, and ending the land grabs that dispossess the small-scale farmers who play vital roles in feeding the world. We need to ensure that the governments of global south nations are able to claim a fair share of taxes owed to them by the multinational companies operating within their borders. This means, in line with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s recommendations, putting an end to the trade mis-invoicing and transfer mispricing practices that large firms employ, and regulating the tax havens and secrecy jurisdictions that are controlled by a few nations in western Europe and North America. Much more than microcredit services are needed to improve the incomes of poor workers. We need to introduce and enforce real labour legislation, which has proved to be instrumental in helping millions of people to escape poverty. On top of this, we need to explore ways to consolidate regulations across borders in order to mitigate globalisation’s race to the bottom for exploitable labour. In all these areas, there is still an enormous amount to be done. If we are concerned about effectiveness, then instead of assessing the short-term impacts of micro-projects, we should evaluate whole public policies. In this respect, there is a wealth of underused data provided by decades of household surveys by national statistical offices. Combined with satellite data, recently made public, they can now be used for detailed analysis, capable of providing clear information on the public policies that have been most successful. In the face of the sheer scale of the overlapping crises we face, we need systems-level thinking. People of the south deserve better. The sustainable development goals we agreed in 2015 hold both for northern and southern countries; they acknowledge that our crisis is a collective one: that fighting against poverty, inequality, biodiversity loss and climate change requires changing the rules of the international economic system to make it more ecological and fairer for the world’s majority. It’s time that we devise interventions – and accountability tools – appropriate to this new frontier.

2018-04-11T06:00:02Z,'Millions missing out': aid fails to make the grade on early years education,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/apr/11/aid-early-child-development-education,"Just 1% of international aid dedicated to young children’s development is being targeted on pre-school education, according to a report that warns spending is imbalanced and short-sighted. While global funding for early childhood development has grown in recent years, almost all of this investment – 95% – has been channelled towards health and nutrition initiatives. Donors are deterred from spending on pre-school education, the report says, because the benefits of doing so are less immediate and visible. The Netherlands and the US, which are among the largest donors to early childhood development, give nothing to pre-primary education. The UK, also a key donor, spends less than 1%, according to the analysis by Cambridge University academics for the children’s charity Theirworld. Professor Pauline Rose, director of the Real Centre, University of Cambridge, and one of the report’s authors, said international donors need to wake up. “Investment in the early years requires access to good quality pre-primary education as well as health and nutrition,” she said. “It is time to take a good look at the numbers and commit to urgent action. If [donors] don’t, millions of children will fail to reach their full potential.” Globally, 43% of children aged five years or under are thought to be at risk of poor development as a result of poverty and stunted growth. This is equivalent to 250 million children. In order to meet the early childhood development targets set out in the sustainable development goals, donors must take a holistic approach, said the report. But the study found spending had become even more imbalanced, with the proportion of early childhood development aid spent on pre-school programmes falling, from 3% to 1% between 2002 and 2016. Only a small number of donors provide significant support to this area, making it vulnerable to cuts if leaders’ priorities change. The analysis uses data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to compare spending on several key areas where resources can be tracked: health, nutrition, sanitation and pre-primary education. It focuses on spending aimed at children aged from birth to six years old. The report says there is strong evidence to support the benefits of investing in pre-school education, and urges donors and governments to invest a minimum of 10% of their education budgets on pre-school initiatives. It cites one study conducted in Mozambique which found rural children who had attended pre-school were more likely to enrol in primary school. Children also had improved cognitive abilities and behaviours compared with their peers who had not enrolled. “Benefits of investing in pre-primary education are found to be the greatest for the most disadvantaged, who are often the least prepared when starting primary school and are therefore most likely to be left behind,” said Sarah Brown, president of Theirworld. “But despite all the evidence, millions of children are continuing to miss out on the chance of a great start in life.” Just 15% of five- to six-year-olds in low-income countries are enrolled in pre-primary education programmes, compared with 82% for children of the same age in high-income countries. Campaigners have warned repeatedly that education projects are severely underfunded, and those for early years even more so. In February, at a global summit, world leaders promised to spend $2.3bn (£1.6bn) on education over the next three years, following warnings from the World Bank of a “global learning crisis”. But donor pledges fell short of the $3bn target given by the Global Partnership for Education. Across the world, more than 260 million children are out of school, and half of those in school are not learning.",Global education; Global development; Children; Aid; Sustainable development goals,Global development
2018-01-15T19:27:04Z,Congolese government in rent arrears for London embassy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/15/congolese-government-in-rent-arrears-for-london-embassy,"The Congolese government is facing legal action for failing to pay rent on its embassy in London, it has emerged. The step taken by the owners of the property on Great Portland Street was revealed in a court case against a group of squatters who have been occupying part of the building. Mount Eden Land Ltd, the freeholder behind the proceedings against the squatters, said that even though the Congolese had failed to pay rent on the embassy it remained a tenant and had a right to the “peaceful enjoyment of the property”. On Monday, a possession order was made in favour of Mount Eden Land, accepting their arguments that the squatters had been trespassing. They now face eviction. The embassy is already the subject of controversy over the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s human rights record, one of the worst in the world. A new wave of protests in London against the regime began on New Year’s Eve after demonstrators in DRC were killed during a peaceful protest and religious leaders were attacked. The anti-Congolese government protesters daubed graffiti on the the London embassy calling for the removal of Joseph Kabila, the country’s president. The squatters, who call themselves the Embassy of the Republic of Conscience, moved into the property in late December. Describing themselves as “environmentally conscious artists”, they have displayed art installations parodying Donald Trump and his stance on climate change and have papered the walls with the UN’s 17 sustainable development goals. The part of the building the squatters are now occupying was previously a shop. There are colourful displays in the shop window on climate change and sustainable living. Daniel, one of the squatters, said: “We wanted a space near Oxford Circus to highlight issues of sustainability. We set up a pop-up embassy of the Republic of Conscience next to the Congolese embassy. As soon as we moved in we witnessed Congolese protesters outside the embassy protesting about human rights abuses. We have had a lot of support from local shopkeepers and will continue to spread our message about environmental sustainability.” Okito Tongomo, leader of the Congolese opposition and president of the Congo Support Group, said he would continue protesting. “The situation on Congo is catastrophic and we are calling for regime change and respect for the constitution,” he said.

2018-01-31T06:31:00Z,Rwanda becomes first poor country to provide eye care for all,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jan/31/rwanda-becomes-first-poor-country-to-provide-eye-care-for-all,"Rwanda has become the first low-income country to provide universal eye care for its 12 million population. The government has partnered with the organisation Vision for a Nation (VFAN) to train more than 3,000 eye care nurses based in 502 local health centres, prescribing glasses and referring those with serious eye problems to national clinics. Nurses have visited each of Rwanda’s 15,000 villages. Dr Jennifer Yip, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, explained the vital importance of looking after people’s sight. “Without the resources to access eye care you are significantly more likely to become blind. “We’ve found that 34% of the population in Rwanda could benefit from some form of eye care. This ranges from very minor symptoms [to] those requiring life-changing surgery.” Short sightedness is the most common eye-related ailment in Rwanda, and more than 80% of eye conditions there are considered preventable. The country ranks 159th on the Human Development Index, and only 19.8% of the population have access to electricity. Dr Graeme Mackenzie, a consultant to Vision for a Nation, described how untreated sight conditions, particularly in women, trap families in a cycle of poverty. “Coffee bean sorting is quite a business in Rwanda,” said Mackenzie. “It is usually females employed in this industry, and their livelihood depends on their ability to sort beans. Around the age of 45 they lose their ability to see well. Their quality of work suffers and therefore their income suffers. “Now, the breadwinner is no longer earning enough. The young girls in the family are pulled out of school so they can work in agriculture to help. They do not finish their education and the whole cycle of poverty is just reinforced.” Poor vision is a significant health and development challenge. Globally, 253 million people live with vision impairment. Tony Hulton, VFAN’s chief executive, said eye care is essential to achieving the sustainable development goals. “We’re not going to fully allow countries to reach their full potential [and move] out of poverty without eye care. Vision and poor sight is a largely unaddressed issue and it doesn’t have the crowds supporting it.” Rwanda’s minister of health, Diane Gashumba, said: “Rwanda is leading the way in Africa by providing all its people with affordable eye care. This has been made possible by the great collaboration between the government of Rwanda and Vision for a Nation. The impact of this initiative has been enormous.” Up next for VFAN is Ghana. Though the country’s larger population and geographical makeup represent additional barriers, Hulton is convinced of the value of the company’s mission. “We do want to focus on the most vulnerable because they are the people who have the least access to both public and private solutions,” he said.",Global health; Sustainable development goals; Global development; Rwanda; Africa; World news,Global development
2018-03-07T18:08:47Z,'Woefully off track': global goals leave behind over half the world's children,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/07/woefully-off-track-global-goals-leave-behind-over-half-worlds-children,"More than half a billion of the world’s poorest children are invisible to the international organisations that could help them most. Children worldwide are “uncounted” in development targets because they live in countries where the data required to monitor and evaluate key areas such as education and nutrition is unavailable, Unicef has warned. According to a report on child-related sustainable development goals (SDGs), roughly 650 million children live in countries where the targets will remain unattainable unless accelerated progress is made to meet current targets. Following current trends, roughly 10 million children will die of preventable causes before their fifth birthday, while 31 million children will be stunted because they lack adequate nutrition, Unicef claims. “More than half the world’s children live in countries where we either can’t track their SDG progress, or where we can and they are woefully off track,” said Laurence Chandy, Unicef’s director for the division of data, research and policy. “Two years ago, the world agreed on an ambitious agenda to give every child the best chance in life, with cutting-edge data analysis to guide the way. Yet, what our comprehensive report on SDG progress for children reveals plainly is an abject lack of data. Most countries do not have the information even to assess whether they are on track or not.” The Unicef report measures countries’ progress in meeting child-related targets in five areas: health, learning, protection from violence and exploitation, equal opportunity and safe environment. Only a minority of nations have met the targets in learning, protection and equal opportunity, the report showed. On average, roughly 80% of child-related indicators in countries either have insufficient data or show insufficient progress. Unicef said ambitious global targets and immature monitoring frameworks were among the reasons for the paucity of data. The report also projected that, by 2030, 22 million children worldwide would not attend pre-primary education; 150 million girls would marry before their 18th birthday; and 670 million people, many of them children, would not have access to drinking water. Globally, adolescent girls and children from poorer homes and rural areas are at greater risk of being left behind than their peers, according to the report. Ethnic minorities, children with disabilities and migrant children are also considered difficult or impossible to assess given existing data. African countries are off track on twice as many child indicators than countries from any other area, with sub-Saharan Africa at the lowest end of the targets, either lacking data or requiring improvement in more than 90% of all child-related SDG indicators. In Central African Republic, for example, there is not a single indicator of progress in the five child-related SDG targets. Chandy said greater effort was needed to ensure all countries have the minimum data coverage for children, irrespective of their resources or capabilities. “The world must renew its commitments to attaining the SDGs, starting with renewing its commitment to measuring them,” he said. However, the Child Rights International Network said little progress could be made regarding children’s rights because the SDGs are not legally binding. “In neglecting a rights-based framework, the overall narrative of the SDGs is one in which children will continue to be seen as objects of charity rather than as holders of human rights,” said the network’s programme manager, Sabine Saliba Boutruche.",Sustainable development goals; Global development; Global education; Environmental sustainability; Children; United Nations; Nutrition and development,Global development
2018-03-18T15:34:12Z,"Developing countries at risk from US rate rise, debt charity warns",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/18/developing-countries-risk-from-us-rate-rise-jubilee-debt-campaign-warns,"The expected rise in US interest rates will increase financial pressures on developing countries already struggling with a 60% jump in their debt repayments since 2014, a leading charity has warned. The Jubilee Debt Campaign said a study of 126 developing nations showed that they were devoting more than 10% of their revenues on average to paying the interest on money borrowed – the highest level since before the G7 agreement to write off the debts of the world’s poorest nations at Gleneagles, Scotland, in 2005. Five of the countries on the charity’s list – Angola, Lebanon, Ghana, Chad and Bhutan – were spending more than a third of government revenues on servicing debts. Developing country debt moved down the international agenda following the Gleneagles agreement in which the G7 industrial countries agreed to spend £30bn writing off the debts owed to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank by the 18 poor countries. But developing country debt is now once again being closely monitored by the IMF, which says 30 of the 67 poor countries it assesses are in debt distress or at risk of being so. Lending to developing countries almost doubled between 2008 and 2014 as low interest rates in the west led to a search for higher-yielding investments. A boom in commodity prices meant many poor countries borrowed in anticipation of tax receipts that have not materialised. But the Jubilee Debt Campaign said the boom–bust in commodity prices was only one factor behind rising debt, pointing out that some countries were paying back money owed by former dictators, while others had been struggling with high debts for many years but had not been eligible for help. The campaign said developing countries were also vulnerable to a rise in global interest rates as central banks withdrew the support they have been providing since 2008. The US Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates this week – with the financial markets expecting two or three further upward moves during 2018. Tim Jones, an economist at the Jubilee Debt Campaign, said: “Debt payments for many countries have risen rapidly as a result of a lending boom and fall in commodity prices. The situation may worsen further as US dollar interest rates rise, and as other central banks reduce monetary stimulus. Debt payments are reducing government budgets when more spending is needed to meet the sustainable development goals.” External loans to developing country governments rose from $200bn per year in 2008 to $390bn in 2014 and while they have since dropped to $300-350bn per year from 2015-2017 they remained well above levels seen prior to the global financial crisis. Commodity prices peaked in the middle of 2014 and more than halved over the next 18 months. Despite a recovery from their low in January 2016 they remain more than 40% lower than they were at their peak. The Jubilee Debt Campaign said the fall in global commodity prices had reduced the income of many governments that are reliant on commodity exports for earnings. In addition, weaker commodity prices led to the exchange rates of developing countries falling against the US dollar, increasing the relative size of debt payments since external debts tend to be owed in dollars. Angola and Mozambique – two sub-Saharan African countries heavily dependent on commodity exports – had both seen falls of 50% in their exchange rates since 2014. Jones said there had been a lack of transparency about how debts had been incurred. And he said private lenders should suffer from any restructuring agreements. “Where there are debt crises, the risk is that the IMF will bail out reckless lenders, and the debt will remain with the country concerned,” Jones said. “Instead, reckless lenders need to be made to bear some of the costs of economic shocks through lower debt payments, allowing governments to maintain spending on essential services.”",US interest rates; Debt relief; Africa; Global development; Federal Reserve; Business; Angola; Lebanon; World Bank; US economy; Bhutan; Economics; World news; Global economy; International Monetary Fund (IMF); Ghana; Chad,Business
2018-03-01T10:00:07Z,"Africa 'very, very far away' from meeting global target to end child malnutrition",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/01/no-african-country-will-end-child-malnutrition-by-2030-says-study,"No African country is expected to reach the UN target of ending childhood malnutrition by 2030, according to a new study. The research, comprised of two papers published in the science journal Nature, is the first of its kind to identify local hotspots for poor child nutrition and low education levels across 51 African countries. By using maps of local health and education data, in 5x5 sq km across the whole continent, researchers identified variations at state and county level missed from previous comparisons. Simon Hay, senior author of the papers and director of geospatial science at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, said the UN global goal of ending childhood malnutrition was always quoted as an “aspirational” target. “All we are trying to say is that this aspiration is very, very far away,” Hay said. “Particularly at a time when people are questioning, at least in the US, at the top levels of government, the value of international aid and what it brings.” The study found that many countries, including Ghana and southern Nigeria, had shown improvement in childhood stunting and wasting since 2000, but indicated that malnutrition indicators remained “persistently high” in 14 countries, stretching the length of the African Sahel from Senegal in the west to Eritrea in the east. “Most of the previous assessments were made at best at a state level and many at a country level,” said Hay. “That masks a lot of variations in a country.” For instance, in Nigeria the national average for basic schooling in 2015 was seven years. Yet the study found wide gaps between northern and southern communities, ranging from two years in the former to 10 years in the latter. Hay said for investments in global health to make progress towards the UN’s sustainable development goals, efforts must be made to address the social inequalities that drive health disparities. The research, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, found that most improvements in child growth failure were sparked by large political, social and financial investments. It was “no coincidence” that nations like Chad, Central African Republic, Somalia and much of the Sahel – areas that had experienced conflict and received less international assistance for child and newborn health – showed no progress, said the study. The researchers warned that the “continued high burden” of wasting in arid sections of the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and southern areas of sub-Saharan Africa was “especially important” given the implications of famine on health, geopolitical unrest and mass migration. The study highlighted a widespread need to adopt “evidence based precision public health programmes to track and improve progress” in order to give clinicians, teachers, donors and others an insight into where best to direct resources. In a foreword to Nature, Kofi Annan, a former UN secretary general, described progress in the fight to end hunger as “patchy” and called for more data to help end malnutrition. “Data gaps undermine our ability to target resources, develop policies and track accountability,” Annan said. “Without good data, we’re flying blind. If you can’t see it, you can’t solve it.” He singled out Senegal, where making malnutrition a political priority has reaped dividends, as an example of what African countries can achieve with impetus from the state. Stunting rates in the west African country dropped by one-third between 2011 and 2015 after the prime minister’s office set up a co-ordinating body tasked with reducing malnutrition.",Malnutrition; Sustainable development goals; Global development; Africa; World news; Food security; Nutrition; Global health,Global development

Fifty million children worldwide have been displaced from their homes by war, disaster and persecution. On their difficult and dangerous journey across key migrant routes they face risks of abuse, forced labour, child slavery and trafficking. Yet approaches to this crisis are failing vulnerable children. Government attempts to prevent the safe entry of refugees into their countries have endangered children, forcing them on to more dangerous routes or into the hands of unscrupulous people smugglers. Frequently, arbitrary immigration rules – even in the UK – deport child refugees when they turn 18 or prevent unaccompanied children from being reunited with their families. This unique gathering of leaders brings together countries that have witnessed this devastating crisis from multiple perspectives – countries from which children are fleeing violent conflict and countries in which they seek refuge. Including Nigeria, where the Boko Haram insurgency has displaced millions; Bangladesh, which has received 650,000 Rohingya children since August; and Cyprus, which sits along the European migrant route. Imagine what could be achieved if these nations were to stand united to support child refugees. I urge them all to demonstrate their shared values of human rights, tolerance and respect by working towards a fairer and more just solution to this crisis. Alison Wallace CEO, SOS Children’s Villages UK • International development secretary Penny Mordaunt’s address in London (Report, 12 April) has raised concerns that children have not been made a primary focus by the Department for International Development. We feel that any UK aid, whatever department oversees it, should prioritise the most vulnerable children and their needs. This is a win-win approach to work towards achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and ensures no one is left behind. We know that around 535 million children – a quarter of the world’s child population – are living in fragile and conflict-affected states. Yet, globally, less than 1% of the official development assistance is spent on ending violence against children. This means those in fragile states are deprived of the normal protection of community, school and family, and are at serious risk of violence and abuse at the hands of slavers, traffickers, armed groups and all those who would exploit them. Sarah Pickwick Senior conflict adviser, World Vision UK • Perhaps now, the mature trees of Sheffield (17,500 in danger of being felled under the council’s PFI contract) can after all, be saved and incorporated into the Queen’s Canopy (The Queen’s Green Planet review, 16 April). Let’s silence the chainsaws and join Commonwealth countries in a project dedicated to the maintenance of biodiversity, a healthy environment and the protection of our precious trees for generations to come. Jenny O’Shea London • Afua Hirsch’s piece (What is the Commonwealth if not the British Empire 2.0?, 18 April) makes interesting reading, but the most disheartening aspect of the Commonwealth is not that “while Britain is proud of the institution, its black and brown people are regarded with contempt”. Unacceptable as it is, white-on-black-and-brown contempt in the UK is nothing compared with the homegrown black-on-black and brown-on-brown contempt in Africa, the Caribbean and south-east Asia. You only have to look at the appalling post-election violence in Kenya, the constitutional amendment in Uganda, or India’s system of “untouchables”, for example. The real outrage is the ever-widening gap between rich and poor Commonwealth countries. It so outrageous that the theme of the 2018 summit – Towards a common future – would be comical if the reality of dehumanising poverty was not so tragic for African, south-east Asian and Caribbean countries and their peoples, especially the millions of unemployed youths as well as city slum women and their children, who are living in tin shacks without running water, adequate food, sanitation or security. Their intolerable poverty is manifesting itself in mass migration in search of a better life in the rich Commonwealth countries such as Australia, Canada and the UK. Instead of pretending that all Commonwealth countries and peoples are moving “towards a common future”, the rich members should prioritise assisting their poor counterparts in tackling population growth, which is the primary cause of environmental degradation, urbanisation, unemployment, famine, political violence and ultimately mass migration.

2018-04-18T12:09:27Z,"Only Brexit could inspire this cynical, lost empire vision of Commonwealth | Peter Beaumont",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/apr/18/commonwealth-leaders-brexit-cynical-lost-empire-vision-peter-beaumont,"Surveying the paucity of mentions of the Commonwealth in British political party manifestos in 2015, Philip Murphy, the professor of British and Commonwealth history at the School of Advanced Study, identified two trends to explain what he believed was its looming irrelevance. “All in all,” he mused in an essay for the Conversation, “it is difficult to think of a single major achievement of the Commonwealth since 2010. “But it’s also striking,” Murphy continued, “how a nostalgic conception of the ‘old’ Commonwealth still has a hold on the British imagination, and the right wing of politics in particular.” As the biennial junket of the Commonwealth heads of government meeting takes place this week in London, Murphy’s comments – uttered before the reality of Brexit darkened the door of UK diplomacy – only serve to underline that never has there seemed an international body more in need of a purpose. Its serial and increasingly lukewarm reinventions since the twilight of the British empire – from “British Commonwealth”, to Commonwealth, to its last repurposing in 2012 with the adoption of its first-ever charter – mirror that lack of a compelling raison d’être. When it is talked up – for instance by the BBC ahead of the meeting – it is in terms of a cheap tailor inviting us to “never mind the quality – feel the width”. The Commonwealth is “rather big”, we are reminded, home to a third of the world’s population with its constituent members living in countries that comprise a quarter of the world’s landmass. The odds are, however, that you could not name its secretary general (Lady Patricia Scotland) or say what the Commonwealth is actually for. Brutally, Boris Johnson, before becoming foreign secretary, suggested that the Commonwealth’s most useful function was to supply a backdrop of “cheering crowds” of Africans (he used racist and demeaning language) and as a feelgood fillip for the increasingly controversial then-prime minister Tony Blair. While Johnson may have moderated his troubling language somewhat in the intervening years, it appears that his view of the institution has not much improved, recently appearing to suggest to the cross-party foreign affairs committee that it was not much of a priority. And Johnson’s flip intimation that a key role of the Commonwealth is supplying a kind of existential meaning to the hollowed crown of Windsor (and troubled prime ministers) will not have been dispelled by the suggestion of new roles for Prince Charles (as its possible titular head) and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle as joint youth ambassadors. The problems with the Commonwealth are well-rehearsed. There was the accusation by Gambia on its withdrawal from the organisation that it was a “neo-colonial institution” and persistent charges of lack of imagination in its sometimes opaque bureaucracy. Then there has been concern about its vulnerability to exploitation for political gain by states stained with human rights abuse allegations – most notably Sri Lanka. But despite the periodic controversies, the real problem is how forgettable the Commonwealth has become, more associated with the quadrennial games in the public’s mind than with much else. In terms of global development – and at the centre of its renewed focus – ostensibly, its aims are admirable, not least the charter’s 16 values of democracy, gender equality, sustainable development and international peace and security. On climate change too, in particular ahead of the Paris agreement, the Commonwealth acted as a conduit for the views of smaller countries from the global south. In practical terms, much of what it does, not least in terms of the delivery of sustainable development goals, is open to the criticism that it only duplicates UK commitments whose main effort goes on in other forums like the UN. Perhaps most serious of all is the way in which – as Murphy intuited – the Commonwealth has become a vessel to be filled by the Conservative politics of Brexit, rolling a rose-tinted view of lost empire into the exigencies of finding new markets, gilded with a glib free market view of trade as the answer to poverty. What that means, as development secretary Penny Mordaunt and Liam Fox made clear in a joint article for the Telegraph this week, is what they described as “the beginning of a new approach to inclusive trade, development and prosperity”. In short that means increasing trade for the Commonwealth’s biggest economy – the UK post-Brexit – and pretending that is aid. It is the cynical papier-mache vision of not-quite-empire and of not-quite-development for a not-quite-important institution that only the dull fever dream of Brexit could inspire.",Aid; Global development; Commonwealth of Nations; Private sector; World news,Global development
2018-02-01T07:00:34Z,Penny Mordaunt hails 'heroic' British aid response to plague in Madagascar,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/feb/01/penny-mordaunt-hails-heroic-british-aid-plague-madagascar,"Penny Mordaunt has claimed that “heroic” British efforts to tackle an outbreak of plague in Madagascar helped to save thousands of lives. The international development secretary said efforts to control the spread of plague, which killed more than 200 people on the island last year, “averted a catastrophe”. Funding from the Department for International Development (DfID) to the World Health Organization helped to provide the Madagascan government with specialist support in the early stages of the outbreak. DfID and the Department of Health and Social Care provided three experts who flew to the African island to provide advice on monitoring, infection prevention and control, through safe burial and airport screening. The WHO sent out 114 experts and 1.2m doses of antibiotics, and set up nine treatment centres. In her first appearance before the international development committee, Mordaunt said DfID had “managed to stop an outbreak of the black death in Madagascar”. She said: “It was our phenomenal preparedness, our swift response and our expertise that has literally saved thousands of lives and averted a catastrophe. “That heroic action, I want every British citizen to feel a real pride in.” Insisting that she was always conscious of the responsibility that goes with spending public money, Mordaunt added: “It is the British people, ultimately, that enabled that heroic action.” British aid also helped avert famine in Somalia last year as well as stopping the spread of Ebola, she told MPs. Mordaunt confirmed the government’s pledge to continue to spend 0.7% of gross national income on aid – which last year totalled £13.4bn – and said she was commited to DfID remaining a stand-alone government department. MPs raised concerns that Mordaunt’s “Brexit-ready” strategy of using aid to boost trade with developing countries could signal a move towards “tied aid”. “No, it doesn’t” she said, citing her work with Liam Fox, the trade secretary, on the issue. “I’ve seen tied aid around the world and it doesn’t work. We don’t need the help, we can compete and we should compete.” Mordaunt said poverty reduction remained the key purpose of aid. “This is our core mission, this is what we are here to do,” she said. The MP for Portsmouth North said she had made important changes to enable ministers to be better informed in “real time” about global crisises such as the persecution of the Rohingya people in Myanmar. These included a weekly meeting at which ministers hear from operational teams around the world. The British government was criticised by the international development committee last week for an “unacceptable failure” to respond to the Rohingya crisis quickly enough. Matthew Rycroft, DfID’s new permanent secretary, who also appeared before the committee, said the department would collaborate with other ministries that spend British aid money to ensure DfID got the “best bang for our buck”. In 2016, departments other than DfID accounted for 18% of the UK’s aid spend. Some humanitarian organisations have expressed concern that this money is not managed as well or transparently as when funding goes through DfID. Rycroft, the former UK permanent representative to the UN, said he brought to DfID a passionate commitment to the sustainable development goals, a belief in the multi-lateral system, and a desire to see the reform of a humanitarian system that was not up to the challenges of the 21st century. The UK was leading UN reform, he said.",Aid; Global development; Madagascar; UK news; Africa; World news; Penny Mordaunt; Department for International Development (DfID); World Health Organization,Global development
2018-02-19T11:38:37Z,WHO warns over measles immunisation rates as cases rise 300% across Europe,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/19/who-warns-over-measles-immunisation-rates-as-cases-rise-400-across-europe,"Measles cases have soared across Europe over the last year, with large outbreaks affecting one in four countries, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) which is concerned by low rates of immunisation against the disease. WHO Europe says there has been a four-fold increase during 2017, with more than 21,000 cases and 35 deaths. That will be a major disappointment following the record low in 2016, when there were just 5,273 cases in Europe. “Every new person affected by measles in Europe reminds us that unvaccinated children and adults, regardless of where they live, remain at risk of catching the disease and spreading it to others who may not be able to get vaccinated,” said Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO regional director for Europe. “Over 20,000 cases of measles, and 35 lives lost in 2017 alone, are a tragedy we simply cannot accept.” Measles can kill or cause long-term damage. One in every thousand children affected develops encephalitis, which is swelling of the brain and can lead to deafness or learning difficulties. Measles is targeted for elimination around the world, because of the efficacy of the vaccine, but it has been bedevilled by regular outbreaks. WHO said there were large outbreaks last year in 15 of the 53 countries in the European region. Romania was worst affected with 5,562 cases, followed by Italy with 5,006 and Ukraine with 4,767. Immunisation in those countries has hit a number of problems in recent years. There have been declines in overall routine immunisation coverage, consistently low coverage among some marginalised groups, interruptions in vaccine supply or underperforming disease surveillance systems. Greece (967), Germany (927), Serbia (702), Tajikistan (649), France (520), the Russian Federation (408), Belgium (369), the United Kingdom (282), Bulgaria (167), Spain (152), Czechia (146) and Switzerland (105) also experienced large outbreaks, many of which were in decline by the close of 2017. Confidence in the MMR – measles, mumps and rubella – vaccine and in immunisation generally has been an issue in Europe and in the United States following the discredited claims of the researcher Andrew Wakefield, who linked the MMR to the development of autism. WHO released the data ahead of a ministerial meeting on immunisation in Montenegro on 20 February 2018, saying that the drive to eliminate the disease continues. “Elimination of both measles and rubella is a priority goal that all European countries have firmly committed to, and a cornerstone for achieving the health-related Sustainable Development Goals,” said Jakab. “This short-term setback cannot deter us from our commitment to be the generation that frees our children from these diseases once and for all.” Europe has been moving closer to the goal, with one country after another reviewed each year by an independent commission, which recommends what should be done to overcome specific challenges such as problems with the supply of vaccines. By the end of 2016, 42 of the 53 countries in the WHO region had interrupted endemic measles transmission. But cases will continue to cross borders and spark outbreaks until all of them - and their neighbours - are measles-free. Last month, Public Health England (PHE) warned that there were measles cases in several regions of England: Sussex, West Midlands, Surrey, Greater Manchester, Merseyside and West Yorkshire. Parents were urged to get their children vaccinated if they had not done so. PHE said anyone who had visited Romania, Germany or Italy might be particularly at risk. The first dose of MMR vaccine is given to babies when they are a year old. The second, which is more often missed, is given just before children start school. • This article was amended on 20 February 2018. Latest figures from WHO revealed a 300% increase in cases of measles, not a 400% increase as an earlier version had it.",MMR; Vaccines and immunisation; Health; World Health Organization; Society; Infectious diseases; Science,Society
2018-09-18T04:01:14Z,The African youth boom: what's worrying Bill Gates | Polly Toynbee,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/sep/18/the-african-youth-boom-whats-worrying-bill-gates,"What worries Bill Gates most? The booming population of Africa looms over his foundation’s latest global survey. By the end of this century there will be 4 billion more people on Earth – and 3 billion of these extra souls will be born in Africa. The challenge, he says, is that “Africa must almost quadruple its agricultural productivity to feed itself. That’s very daunting.” The philanthropist is torn between sending out a message of hope and a message of fear when I meet him at his foundation’s spacious campus in the heart of his hometown, Seattle. He is reaching for what works best to revive the west’s faltering conscience in the face of “America first” nationalism and rising pull-up-the-drawbridge populism in Europe. The spirit of generosity is under assault as government aid budgets come under constant sniper fire from right-wing politicians and their media. Half of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation spending goes to Africa. The funds put into the foundation by themselves and fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett now amount to more than than $50bn (£38bn). Until last year Gates, the Microsoft founder, was the world’s richest man. He has now been overtaken by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. Gates’ first instinct is optimism. Just consider the astonishing story of how far and how fast people have been brought out of abject poverty in a very short time. Since 2000, a billion people have been taken well over the line of $1.90-a-day wretchedness (£1.45), with the same uplift among those previously living on $3.20 a day. The foundation’s report bursts with remarkable data – too few people know about the galloping progress of humankind. Take India, where only 18 years ago almost one in five children were not enrolled in primary school – now, 97% attend classes. Look at the indicators on the report’s global scorecard for the UN’s sustainable development goals for 2030, and most things are improving almost everywhere. But there is a marked variation in the future trajectory: progress depends on the level of future investment. Today, the west takes some persuading that things are getting better, especially in Europe where countries like Britain have suffered a decade of falling real living standards and eye-watering austerity. The upbeat message of Gates – as well as those in his late friend Hans Rosling’s book Factfulness, and Steven Pinker’s Enlightenment Now – telling us most of the world is on an unprecedented upswing, jars with our reality. Yet it is so: the world has never seen such a rapid rise in prosperity among most of the poor. Eager to encourage western countries to keep giving aid, Gates is well aware that Britain – as elsewhere – suffers frequent political attacks on its aid budget. The UK, Sweden and Norway are among the few reaching the UN aid spending target of 0.7% of gross national income, and all feel the cold blast of an anti-foreigner political grudge. “If you are saving lives for a very small amount of money, people should feel good about that,” Gates says emphatically, protesting at current cynicism about international aid organisations. Look what can be done, he keeps saying, pointing as an example to the brilliant education system in Vietnam, a poor country whose results outstrip far richer ones. If Britain needs encouragement, he says, “the data about the impact has been amazing. The UK has been very generous to the vaccine fund, for two miraculous vaccines – one for pneumonia, one for diarrhoea.” These sicknesses are now preventable “at extremely low cost to all the children of the world. The UK led that effort and saved over 10 million lives.” Do people across the UK know that? He admits a failure to spread the good news. “We’re being challenged to explain.” Everyone should know this message of hope. “We’re talking about uplifting the human condition in a fairly dramatic way.” But if hope doesn’t beat the new nativism infecting the western world, then fear is Gates’ ammunition of last resort. Ignore Africa at your peril. “The stability of Africa makes a huge difference to the entire world.” Here come the threats: “A pandemic like Ebola can spread very fast,” he warns, and many others spread even faster if there are no local health services to contain them. Migration is the other threat to touch Europe’s politics. Syria was a small country, he reminds us, yet its civil war exodus has “challenged the asylum system”. But watch out because “Africa is another order of magnitude”. The huge African youth boom is a strong theme in the report, where in a world of ageing and shrinking populations, Africa’s demographic bulge could be an asset or a threat. So it would be wise “to make their lives attractive” not just out of “pure human caring”. Invest in Africa’s young, their human capital, health and education, support more productive agriculture, protect subsistence farmers against climate change and see how self-interest blends with good works. Africa, he always stresses, is not one country. Of its 54 nations, many are leaping ahead, Ghana, Botswana and Rwanda among them. Those causing concern are the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria. On his recent visit he warned Nigerians against the country’s growing inequality, where oil wealth for a few is leaving millions behind. The foundation has spent $1bn so far on Nigeria. He says: “Their health system is worse than poorer countries, their agricultural advice largely broken down.” Government resources are low because “their level of taxation is one of the lowest in the world”. He sounds puzzled: “You would think politicians would compete on the basis of, ‘Hey, I’m going to run a primary health system really well, I’m going to get vaccination coverage up, I’m going to save lives …’ But other issues about religion and ethnicity come to the fore.” Gates is something of a political naif. After all, I point out, look at us in the west. Look at the gross and rising inequality in the US and UK, look at the need for better public services, yet politics is all too often about culture wars and identity issues – Brexit for us, guns and abortion for America. Look at the problem of homelessness, with tent cities on the streets of his rich Seattle, a most liberal city, where only 8% voted Trump. Yes, he’s trying to help the homelessness crisis: he gives £350m a year to US causes. So we reachthe great blond elephant in the room, President Trump, who has stopped funding family planning organisations that also offer abortions, stalling access to contraception where women need it most. Trump also attacked the foreign aid budget, but “fortunately the Congress, including a lot of Republicans, said no”. How much can Gates influence him? Here, he steps with the caution of a barefoot man crossing broken glass, anxious to say nothing that could further imperil America’s aid budget. “We have to work with Trump himself and the whole administration on ‘What is your vision for Africa?’ And as a human being who cares about human beings, as a country who doesn’t want to go fight foreign wars or deal with pandemics that are out of control …” Did that pitch work? What helped was the famous warning of Trump’s defence secretary, General James Mattis, that soft power – state department diplomacy and aid – prevents the need for hard power: “If you don’t fully fund the state department then I need to buy more ammunition.” Is Trump persuadable? Gates pauses to pace a cautious reply: “Yes, one of the things you can say, a plus or minus, is in very few areas does he have a fixed ideology. If there’s something where he feels he can look smart … particularly if it’s doing things in a different way than was done before, then yes, I think he’s open-minded.” But the truth is that it would be hard to find two mega-wealthy men further apart in their view of the world, their mission or their morality than Trump and Gates. While Trump slashes tax for the rich, Gates constantly calls for the wealthy to be taxed more. “The fact that people aren’t for an estate tax [inheritance tax] is kind of mind-boggling to me.” He says creation of hereditary aristocracies dampens dynamism. “It’s amazing we allow people to have gigantic amounts of money when the state should take more of that.” He wants higher tax on corporate profits too. Famously, he boasts he has paid $6bn in tax, more than anyone on Earth, “and gladly so”. He sounds perplexed by the forces of darkness that fail to see the need for equality at home and globally, that oppose redistribution through taxes and that sneer at the spirit of philanthropy. Surely, he says at the end of our interview, “the improvement in the world is something people should be excited about”.

2018-05-14T08:40:34Z,"With or without Trump, we must back UN's education drive | Larry Elliott",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/13/un-education-initiative-is-chance-to-show-multilateralism-is-not-dead,"All things considered, the United Nations could have chosen a better week to launch an initiative designed to raise $10bn to invest in global education. That this is not exactly a golden age for multilateralism was underlined last week when Donald Trump decided that the US was going to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal despite strong lobbying from Germany, France and the UK. Trump has his own way of doing things and for the most part that involves unravelling the legacy of his predecessor. Barack Obama signed up for the Paris climate change deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement (TPP) and the accord that lifted sanctions on Iran, and Trump has said all three suck and need to be renegotiated. The current White House only sees a merit in internationalism when it clearly furthers the president’s America First agenda. This is a high-risk strategy. The US is already on the brink of a trade war with China that could easily develop into a currency war. There have already been ramifications in the Middle East from the unpicking of the Iran deal. The US has not completely given up on multilateralism. Trump initially seemed reluctant to give the go-ahead for a $13bn capital increase for the World Bank that would allow the Washington-based organisation to lend more. In the end, the Bank got its money – but only once it had agreed to reforms that would make borrowing more expensive for China. Even so, the rest of the world can no longer take for granted that the US will play a pivotal role in any attempts to craft multilateral solutions to global problems. For 70 years, American presidents took the view that multilateralism – even when flawed – served US interests. That is no longer always the case. And if the Americans are not prepared to participate, there is a risk that the whole system will start to unravel. No other country is really prepared to take up the role of global leadership. Which is why the new UN education initiative – the International Finance Facility for Education – is significant. Unveiled in New York last Friday, the idea is being championed by the former prime minister Gordon Brown, now the UN special envoy for global education. Brown proved mightily effective when he was chancellor between 1997 and 2007 as an advocate for international cooperation on development. Even then, in the pre-financial crisis days, getting rich countries to agree to debt relief or to increase their aid budgets was not easy. The climate is a lot more difficult now than it was at Gleneagles in 2005 when the G8 summit agreed to write off poor-country debt and double aid spending. In the much gentler environment of the early 2000s, countries joined together to launch the Global Fund to fight Aids, TB and malaria, and the vaccine alliance Gavi – both of which saved millions of lives. The new UN facility hopes to have the same sort of impact in education. The scheme involves donor countries devoting more of their aid budgets to education but also providing guarantees that would allow the World Bank and the regional development banks to leverage up their lending for education. The UN believes that $1bn of guarantees will lead to an additional $4bn of investment and that reaching its $10bn target is feasible. Extra spending is certainly needed. There are more than 260 million children and young people not in school. Dropout rates in poor countries are so high that half a billion children either abandon primary school or learn very little. About one in 10 of the world’s population is illiterate and in 20 countries in Africa and Asia more than half the people cannot read or write. This is all happening at a time when the world of work is about to be transformed by robotics and artificial intelligence. Nobody knows for sure what the AI revolution will mean for jobs but even those who are most bullish about its impact accept that those who will adapt best are likely to be the skilled and the well educated. One of the UN’s sustainable development goals is that by 2030 every child should complete primary and secondary education. On current trends, that target is going to be missed by a mile and, in any event, slightly misses the point. It is not only the quantity but also the quality of education that needs to be addressed. Learning standards in a low or lower-middle income country are 100 years behind those in the developed world – and that divide is going to widen if the current trends persist. The traditional development route was for countries to move their people out of the fields and into the factories, where they would produce low-cost goods for export. However, in the future, the route out of poverty will be education-led growth – and that is going to be expensive. There is not the slightest prospect that low and lower-middle income countries can fund the necessary investment in education out of their own meagre resources. Meanwhile, the share of international aid being spent on education has fallen over the past decade – from 13% to 10%. On past form, it would be unwise to assume that Trump will support the UN initiative. But other rich countries certainly should because there will be consequences if the scheme fails. One will be mass migration because people in poor countries want the lifestyle they see in rich countries and if they cannot get it at home they will move to somewhere else. But they will also be spurning an opportunity to show that multilateralism is not dead.",Business; Education; United Nations; Donald Trump; Gordon Brown; US news; World news; Europe; UK news; Politics,Business
2019-01-01T02:00:06Z,Hello 2019 – what are you likely to bring?,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/01/what-will-happen-in-2019-main-events,"A year is much more than just 365 days, or one orbit of the Earth around the sun. One year produces so many events and human stories that in 2018 alone, the Guardian published more than 73,000 news articles. Much of what happens is unpredictable. But with 2019 only hours old, there are a few things that can confidently be foretold. Politics and elections Brexit may be clear as mud, but if it’s making you queasy then here are a few fixed political points in the year to steady the balance. It’s a busy year for elections, with four of the world’s most populous democracies holding votes. Europe holds parliamentary elections from 23-26 May to elect 705 new MEPs. Watch closely to see how well the populist far-right does. It’s been gaining ground across the continent, but will the attentions of Steve Bannon, formerly of Breitbart and the Trump White house, help or hinder? Before that, Nigerians head to the polls in February. Sitting president Muhammadu Buhari faces a record 78 opposition candidates, some of whom accuse him of failing to deal adequately with corruption. Following an illness earlier this year and five months spent recuperating in London, there have also been bizarre suggestions that he has been replaced by a body double. That would certainly make campaigning in the world’s seventh most populous country easier. Other major democracies going to the polls include India, where Narendra Modi is seeking a second term, and Indonesia, where the one-term incumbent faces a challenge from yet another rightwing populist candidate. Speaking of rightwing populists, Brazil’s newly elected and controversial president Jair Bolsonaro takes office on 1 January. Other notable votes take place in Thailand (February), South Africa (May), Argentina (October) and Canada (October). And finally, in Japan, Emperor Akihito will abdicate in April owing to health concerns after heart surgery and treatment for prostate cancer. This will be the first time a Japanese emperor has abdicated in two centuries. What summits are there to climb? The last time France hosted the G7 summit of the world’s most industrialised nations in 2011, migration was a fringe issue, Emmanuel Macron was a little-known investment banker and the riots were happening across the channel in the UK. This time around, President Macron will welcome his peers to Biarritz in August. Priorities are likely to include climate change, the Global Partnership for Education, towards which Macron pledged €500m (£452m) of funding, and migration. The G7’s larger cousin, the G20, will meet in Japan in June. Founded after the financial crash of 2008, the summit promotes cooperation and a focus on global financial markets. The G20 has been criticised for becoming “a stage for an increasing number of authoritarian and populist leaders who are there to perform for their restive followers back home”. According to the Guardian’s economics editor Phillip Inman, this year’s version will be “increasingly hampered by Donald Trump’s protectionist policies”. Another year means another COP – the abbreviation for the annual UN climate summits that warn, with increasing severity, how imperilled we are by our carbon addiction. Alas, this year’s host, Brazil, has pulled out owing to “budget restrictions”. If the summit goes ahead, discussion will surely centre on Trump’s continued disavowal of the Paris agreement, and a review of the 2030 UN Sustainable Development goals, four years on from their implementation. The Women Deliver conference, which is held once every two years on women’s equality and gender rights, will take place in June in Canada, with Justin Trudeau billed to speak – the first time a sitting leader of a country has done so. What anniversaries and milestones are coming up? As 2018 marked the 100th anniversary of the first world war armistice, so 2019 will see the 100th anniversary of the Treaty of Versailles, the formal end of the conflict. It is also the 70th anniversary of the founding of Nato, the collective defence pact originally set up to “keep the Russians out, the Americans in and the Germans down”. The internet is poised to pass a notable milestone meanwhile, with predictions that the number of global users will pass the 50% mark in 2019. In the US, for the first time ever the population will have more people older than age 60 than younger than age 18. In births and deaths, 2019 is the 500th anniversary of the death of original renaissance man Leonardo Da Vinci and the 200th anniversary of the birth of Queen Victoria. It also marks the 250th anniversary of Captain Cook reaching New Zealand, and the 20th anniversary of the creation of the euro. What’s happening in science? This year will mark the 50th anniversary of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin’s moon landing. No human has been back since 1972. Perhaps a moment to rekindle interest in our cosmological outrider. The year will also see the first private spacecraft from SpaceX and Boeing take crews to the International Space Station. There will also be the first images of a black hole from the Event Horizon telescope, and the first results from the ESA’s Trace Gas Orbiter probe, which is circling Mars to work out if methane plumes are due to life on the planet. Back on Earth, the landmark agreement to redefine the kilogram will come into place in May. Rather than being tied to a lump of metal stored in a Parisian vault, the new definition will be a reflection of Planck’s constant, a number rooted in the quantum world. The weight is over. 2019 could see the first birth in the UK of a baby with DNA from three parents. The process of mitochondrial transfer was legalised in Britain in 2015 and Professor Alison Murdoch has since been pioneering the technique in Newcastle, with the first woman selected to take part in the process this year. John Vary, a futurologist at John Lewis’s Innovation Labs, notes some broader, science fiction-style developments which may also intrigue us in 2019. “In 2019, we could reach a point where customers can share their DNA with shops so that retailers can tailor products to a customer’s genetics or ancestry,” he predicts. “Waitrose &amp; Partners is piloting DnaNudge, an app which will use shoppers’ DNA to help them make healthier choices while food shopping. Another example is OME Health, which offers health plans built on a person’s gut microbiome, genetics blood markers and other health data.” Will there be a global recession? Despite 2019 being the Chinese year of the pig – a symbol that denotes wealth – in the western world there may be an economic downturn ahead. According to economics editor Phillip Inman: “A recession looms in the UK, Europe and the US. It is possible once the impact of slowing growth in China and rising interest rates are put together, since most of the momentum after the financial crash of 2008 was based on cheap borrowing and the rapid expansion of Chinese trade. Without these two essential elements, the major economies are heading for trouble. Most doomsayer analysts consider 2020 a more likely year for a slump, with the seeds sown in 2019 by poor policy making.” The World Bank is predicting a global slowdown in 2019, as the stimulative impact of Donald Trump’s tax cuts wane in the US and China is forced to restrict borrowing by state and private businesses. Central banks are also poised to tighten monetary policies. “The US Federal Reserve is due to increase interest rates at least twice in 2019,” Inman says. “It is also expected to further unwind its quantitative easing policy. An increase in the cost of borrowing is already hitting the US housing market which is reaching levels of distress last seen in the run up to the 2008 financial crash.” The World Trade Organisation could be unableto judge trade disputes between countries in 2019. When he took office, Donald Trump blocked the appointment of judges to the WTO to replace retirees, leaving a large number of vacancies. The WTO needs a minimum number of legal experts to judge cases and could be inquorate as early as spring 2019. What should I buy in 2019? There will be no shortage of new technological releases in 2019. Samsung is due to launch follow-ups to its critically acclaimed Galaxy S and Note series, while Apple will be announcing a new iPhone in September, and Google the Pixel 4 phone in October. Amazon will be announcing new products in September, likely to be iterations of its home management Echo devices, and Apple will unveil new Macs and tablets in October. In terms of tech developments, the Guardian’s assistant technology editor Samuel Gibbs predicts that the biggest advance will come in the form of flexible screens in 2019. Futurologist John Vary adds that the voice search enabled by products such as Google Home and Amazon’s Alexa will develop to “enable people to find items however they describe them and in any language”. While augmented reality could enhance personalised shopping to mean “smart home tech could act as your own shopper, alerting retailers in advance when you’re looking for a product,” he says. What can I (binge) watch? With Channel 4 moving to new headquarters in Leeds in 2019, the Guardian’s TV editor, Lanre Bakare, picks the fourth season of comedy Catastrophe and Brexit: The Uncivil War, as ones to watch on the channel next year. Catastrophe tells the story of a couple raising a child conceived in a one night stand. The two-hour Brexit drama meanwhile stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Leave campaigner Dominic Cummings, and is based on first-hand accounts of the campaigns leading up to Britain’s referendum on leaving the EU in 2016. Further recommendations include big-budget sequels – the final season of fantasy thriller Game of Thrones, airing on Sky Atlantic in April. There’s also the third season of the brooding American noir True Detective in January. Moonlight Oscar winner Mahershala Ali takes the lead from season two’s Colin Farrell and Rachel McAdams. Finally, everyone’s favourite local Norwich radio presenter returns to the BBC with a satirical take on a live talk show in February on This Time … With Alan Partridge. On the big screen there is a volley of new releases to look out for. With 2018 being a record-breaking year for box office takings, major studios will be hoping to replicate their success with a slate of blockbusters: a live-action Lion King in July, Captain Marvel in May – the franchise’s first female-led film – Toy Story 4 in June, Terminator 6 and Frozen 2 in November, and the final instalment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy, Star Wars IX, in December. The Guardian’s film editor Catherine Shoard’s picks include King’s Speech director Tom Hooper’s adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Cats, starring Idris Elba, Taylor Swift, Judi Dench and Ian McKellen. There is also the Downton Abbey movie; Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman, starring Godfathers Al Pacino and Robert De Niro; Get Out director Jordan Peele’s latest horror, Us; an adaptation of Donna Tartt’s novel The Goldfinch starring Nicole Kidman; and Greta Gerwig’s adaptation of Little Women, starring 2018’s newcomer Timothée Chalamet. Valued at more than $93bn, the games industry almost doubles the revenue of the international film industry, and the Guardian’s games editor Keza MacDonald has some selections for 2019. Keza picks out Harry Potter Go, made by the creators of Pokémon Go, as “another potential world-conquering mobile game”, she says, this time based on the Harry Potter universe. There is also Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice – a horror samurai game from the director of Dark Souls, “one of the best games of the decade”, according to MacDonald; and The Last of Us Part 2, an “intense, cinematic game about a survivor of a world-decimating outbreak – far from the usual boring zombie story”. Further reading Adele by Leila Slimani (February) One of the runaway bestsellers of 2016 was Slimani’s Lullaby, a chilling tale of a homicidal immigrant nanny, and Slimani hopes to continue this success with a new novel telling the story of a sex-addicted Parisian journalist. Black Leopard, Red Wolf by Marlon James (February) Marlon James releases the follow-up to his Man Booker Prize-winning 2015 novel, A Brief History of Seven Killings. With Black Leopard, James creates an imaginary ancient world built on African mythology to tell the story of a hunter tracking a lost child. It is the first in a new trilogy, Dark Star. The Liar by Ayelet Gundar-Goshen (March) Israeli author Gundar-Goshen pens her third novel on a teenage girl who accuses an older minor celebrity of sexual assault. A fictionalised tale building on the #MeToo movement of 2017-18. The Other Americans by Laila Lalami (March) Pulitzer prize finalist Lalami writes a novel charting the American immigrant experience through the eyes of a Moroccan family living in California. It is already earning praise from the likes of JM Coetzee. Clear Bright Future by Paul Mason (April) Journalist Paul Mason follows up on 2016’s Postcapitalism, which formulated a collapse of capitalism as we know it, with a theorisation of what makes us human and how we are still capable of changing the future. The Heartland by Nathan Filer (April) Former mental health nurse Nathan Filer publishes his second book, a collection of first-person encounters and essays on the diagnosis and treatment of schizophrenia.",Politics; World news; UK news; US news; Science; Television; Television & radio; Books; Culture; Economics; Business,News
2018-03-07T23:35:13Z,We can’t own girls. We owe them | Julia Gillard,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/08/we-cant-own-girls-we-owe-them,"Just two weeks ago, we learned of yet another tragic abduction by Boko Haram of girls in northeastern Nigeria. A near replay of the 2014 mass kidnapping in Chibok that attracted global attention, the terror group this time reportedly kidnapped more than 100 girls at a boarding school in the town of Dapchi in Yobe state. The continuing and extreme threat to girls who only want to go to school is a stark reminder of why we must observe International Women’s Day, as we do today. In spite of the truly remarkable social, economic and political strides for women around the world over the last generation, we’re far from the goal of full gender equality. One of the primary measures of that progress is how many girls globally get the education they deserve and need to live full, prosperous lives. It’s encouraging that the number of girls who are not in school at all has dropped by about 40% since 2000. Yet there are still more than 130 million out-of-school girls globally. They will join the ranks of almost 500 million illiterate women across the globe, two-thirds of all illiterate adults. Without the ability to read, write and do basic math, most of these women will live in extreme poverty and hardship, unable to govern their own destinies or live out their full potential in life. By kidnapping and essentially enslaving girls, Boko Haram is trying not only to deny them an education, but to own them as property and slaves. While most of today’s out-of-school and under-educated girls have not faced violations and depredations of such a magnitude, their right to education is also being denied, and they face significant challenges. Too many girls still become “child brides” and mothers, or end up in wage-earning work at young ages to support their families, or are deemed unworthy of the schooling that boys get. And other barriers – such as unaffordable school fees, dangerous treks to school, threats of sexual abuse, inadequate menstruation facilities, humanitarian crises and lack of female teachers – keep them from school. It’s a reality that Fatoumata Jallow-Tambajang, the vice president of the Gambia, powerfully addressed in her remarks last month at the Global Partnership for Education’s (GPE) Financing Conference in Senegal. A child bride herself who married and had a child at 16, she later went on to receive a university degree in France and to work within and outside of government, often as a leading advocate of women’s rights. Noting that she was determined to send her four daughters and four sons to school, vice president Jallow-Tambajang told conference participants that “educating a girl is educating a nation because the bedrock of a society is a woman.” More than a decade and a half ago, countries around the world began to make a more concerted effort than ever to educate all the world’s children – especially girls, whose access to schooling in many places fell far behind that of boys. More and more developing countries enacted a wide range of long-term interventions aimed to ensure that all girls get a quality education. Wealthier donor countries in turn began to commit more resources to support these efforts, though the share of development aid for education has not always kept up with the level of support for other development sectors. 38 million more girls were enrolled in school across GPE partner countries between 2002 and 2015. The sustainable development goals for education calls for a quality education for all children – especially girls – by 2030. At our conference in Senegal, 53 developing countries committed to increase their own education financing to a total of US$110bn between 2018 and 2020. Donor countries pledged US$2.3bn to the GPE fund. As a result, 26 partner countries have already received new funding allocations and much of this funding will support the education of girls. While financing is essential to reaching the global goal for education, no less critical is changing a persistent mindset in most societies that holds girls back. This International Women’s Day, we reaffirm our determination to replace the idea that it’s acceptable to own or control girls with the notion that we owe them the tools for intellectual development, public participation, and their ability to secure their future. We will devote even more energy, smart thinking and resources to get there. • Julia Gillard was prime minister of Australia and leader of the Labor party from 2010 to 2013.

2018-09-24T05:00:13Z,Why do women still die giving birth?,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/sep/24/why-do-women-still-die-giving-birth,"How many women die in childbirth? According to the latest UN global estimates, 303,000 women a year die in childbirth, or as a result of complications arising from pregnancy. This equates to about 830 women dying each day – roughly one every two minutes. The majority of deaths are from conditions that could have been prevented had women received the right medical care throughout their pregnancies and during birth. Severe bleeding and infections after childbirth are the biggest killers, but high blood pressure, obstructed labour and unsafe abortions all contribute. Accurate maternal mortality figures require strong in-country data collection, which is often unavailable in developing countries, so the number of deaths is likely to be underreported. Where do the deaths occur? The overwhelming majority of maternal deaths occur in developing countries. About two-thirds of all maternal deaths take place in sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria and India alone account for one-third of global deaths. The maternal mortality ratio in the world’s least developed countries stands at 436 deaths for every 100,000 live births, which is in stark contrast to the corresponding number – just 12 – in wealthy countries. World Bank figures show that in 2015 (the latest year for which there are records) Sierra Leone had the highest maternal mortality ratio in the world, with 1,360 deaths for every 100,000 live births – although this represents a 50% reduction since 1990. What progress has been made to reduce deaths? Despite the number of deaths, global figures reflect progress. In 1990 an estimated 532,000 women died annually, so there has been a 44% drop in a generation. But while the reduction certainly merits celebration, it reflects a small return on big global commitments. At the first world conference on women, held in Mexico in 1975, a spotlight was shone on the high number of maternal deaths, and action urged to reduce them. In 1994, 179 governments at the international conference on population and development in Cairo made a joint promise that, by the turn of the century, they would halve the number of maternal deaths recorded in 1990, and then halve the figure again by 2015. This didn’t happen. In 2001, UN member states agreed the millennium development goals, which included a call for the number of maternal deaths to be cut by three-quarters by 2015. While the MDGs boosted efforts, the goal was not met in the countries with the highest death rates. In fact, it was the target that made the slowest progress. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), between 1990 and 2005, maternal mortality rates decreased by an average of 2.3% a year – way below the 5.5% needed to achieve the MDGs. And now the decline seems to have plateaued. Why has the figure plateaued? When there is a high death rate, relatively simple interventions – raising awareness among women of the importance of seeking medical attention during pregnancy and childbirth, training local community health workers to spot signs of problems in labour – will bring fairly quick wins. But moving the needle much further requires greater political will and more money, says Anneka Knutsson, chief of sexual and reproductive health at the UN population fund (UNFPA). “Any intervention that brings women to a health centre to have antenatal care, informs women of the importance of seeking care, or decreases the number of home births done alone, will have a great impact,” she says. “When you get to the level of about 200 deaths [for every 100,000 live births] there are so many more interventions that need to be in place in the health system to reduce it further. These relate to competent staff in place, and facilities that, in addition to safe normal deliveries, can provide blood transfusion, C-section or other types of assisted deliveries. It requires more long-term and complex investments in the health system. This is one reason why the pace of decrease slows down.” Why are women dying? There are a number of reasons, and they are rooted in poverty, inequality and sexism. The majority of women die in poorer, rural areas, where healthcare services are often inadequate or inaccessible, and where there is a severe shortage of trained medical staff. Women from such areas are less likely to give birth with a skilled health worker than wealthier women. In 2014, the state of the world’s midwifery report noted that only 42% of the world’s midwives, nurses and doctors live and work in the 73 countries where the majority of deaths among women and newborn babies occur, and where the most stillbirths occur. Without professional help, women give birth alone or have to rely on female relatives or traditional birth attendants to support them, putting their lives in grave danger if complications arise. Women, particularly in rural areas, may live miles from any health centre, and might struggle to pay for the transport to get there if money is tight. The Guttmacher Institute estimates that just over half of women in Africa will give birth in a health centre, compared with more than 90% in Latin America. Throughout pregnancy, women in poorer countries are much less likely to receive the eight antenatal appointments recommended by the WHO. These appointments are crucial in identifying problems or underlying issues that could cause difficulties in childbirth – if a woman has malaria, for instance, or needs special support because she is HIV-positive. Guttmacher estimated that while 63% of women in developing countries received at least four antenatal care visits during pregnancy, the corresponding figure in Africa was just 51%. The institute calculates that if all women had the level of care recommended by the WHO, maternal deaths would drop by more than 60%, to about 112,000 annually. And what about sexism? Millions of women around the world are still unable to decide when or if they want to get married or have children. In developing countries, about 214 million women and girls aged 15-49 who don’t want to get pregnant are not using a modern form of contraception because they are unable to access it, or because their partners or communities frown on contraceptive use. The largest proportion of women without access to modern contraception is in sub-Saharan Africa. Many countries only allow abortion when a women’s life is at risk, and a handful of countries still have outright bans, despite growing calls for liberalisation. This means many women resort to unsafe, illegal abortions. The WHO estimates that up to 13% of maternal deaths each year are the result of unsafe abortions. “Women are not being given their due respect with regard to sexual and reproductive health and rights,” says Sarah Onyango, technical director in the programmes division of the International Planned Parenthood Federation. “We know what it takes, we have the expertise and resources, broadly … but we ignore it and don’t put enough emphasis on the need to address women’s issues.” Who is most at risk of dying? Adolescent girls have a particularly high risk of death in childbirth. Last year the WHO found that complications in pregnancy and childbirth, together with unsafe abortion, were the biggest killers globally of girls aged 15 to 19. Hypertension and obstructed labour are among the main causes, since their bodies are not fully developed and ready to give birth. About half of all pregnancies among this cohort are unplanned. No official statistics are collected for younger girls (official statistics for reproductive healthcare are only collected for women aged 15 to 49), but the Guttmacher Institute estimates that in 2016, 777,000 babies were born to girls aged 10 to 14. UN member states have signed a resolution to end child marriage but, each year, 7.3 million babies are born to mothers under the age of 18, and nine in 10 births will be to girls who are married. Eighteen of the 20 countries with the highest rates of child marriage are found in Africa, the continent with the highest rates of maternal mortality. Onyango believes conversations about sex need to begin early and contraceptives must be made available to young people. “Most institutions think these conversations are for 18-year-olds but, in reality, age-appropriate comprehensive sexuality education is very important, and needs to begin early.” Is funding for maternal health a problem? Worryingly, aid for maternal health has fallen by about 11% in the past few years, from $4.4bn (£3.4bn) in 2013 to $3.9bn last year. It is unclear why. In the past few years, however, some donor countries have redirected aid to deal with an influx of refugees at home. The UNFPA has a funding gap of about $700m until 2020, not helped by Donald Trump’s decision to stop funding the agency last year. What next? After failing to achieve the MDGs, reducing maternal mortality was made a target of the sustainable development goals, signed by UN member states in 2015. The new global goals commit countries to reduce maternal deaths to fewer than 70 for every 100,000 live births. Ambitious, yes, but it is hoped that setting the bar high will at least spur significant progress. Onyango says strategic targeting of resources will be required to ensure that the poorest, most vulnerable women are better supported. Another of the sustainable development health targets is to ensure universal access to family planning services. There is also a standalone goal calling for gender equality, which specifically includes ending child marriage, and ensuring universal access to reproductive healthcare. Expect lobbying on the issue at the international conference on family planning in Rwanda in November, and next year, which marks the 25th anniversary of the Cairo population and development conference.",Maternal mortality; Maternal health; Global development; Health; Society; Women; World news; Life and style; Gender; Women's health,Global development
2018-02-26T15:57:34Z,"Aid agencies 'complicit in exploitation of most vulnerable', says Mordaunt",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/feb/26/aid-agencies-complicit-exploitation-most-vulnerable-penny-mordaunt,"The international development secretary said the “grotesque” sexual exploitation of the most vulnerable by aid workers was caused by Britain’s failure in its duty to put aid beneficiaries first. The scandal has shown that aid organisations have become complicit in the exploitation of people they were supposed to help, Penny Mordaunt said. To recover from the “wake-up call” of the Oxfam scandal, Mordaunt added, aid organisations needed to live up to their values and deliver on their promises to the world’s poor. Mordaunt, who has accused Oxfam of a “complete betrayal of trust” over the way it handled the Haiti revelations earlier this month, warned aid groups: “You cannot help and support people, you cannot give them hope and a chance, you cannot promote human rights or the dignity of every human being, whilst paying them for sex, and whilst funding an industry that exploits them.” The aid sector is reeling from revelations that organisations including Oxfam, Save the Children and the United Nations have mishandled allegations of sexual misconduct. Oxfam’s work was temporarily suspended in Haiti pending an investigation into how it handled claims of former staff paying for sex. Meanwhile the chief executive of Save the Children has dismissed as “tittle tattle” reports that he was forced to step aside from a review of its handling of complaints of sexual misconduct amid a conflict of interest. Kevin Watkins, who has run the charity since September 2016, said he had had no intention of taking part in the review process from the outset and had informed the board of his decision. Penny Mordaunt, in a reflective speech to a conference run by Bond, the UK network for international development organisations, asked: “How did those, there to protect, support and serve the most vulnerable people on earth, become complicit in their exploitation – by protecting the perpetrators, by failing to grip the problem or turning a blind eye? “Because we failed to put the beneficiaries of aid first. How did we lose sight of that fundamental duty, for all the good people, many in this room today, and all the good works done? For be in no doubt that is what has happened. “It may have started with an attitude born of fundraising pressures, fierce competition for bids or work, guarding an organisation’s reputation to maximise its reach and offer. “That attitude found a justification, via the chaotic and complex situations we operate in, the belief that reporting wrongdoing would do more harm than good, that we’ve so many other things to worry about, or that peacekeeping troops are doing far worse. And then any nagging doubts that lingered, as predatory individuals moved to another organisation’s payroll, were banished, in order to avoid any criticism of the sector.” In reference to Oxfam, the result, she said, was the “grotesque fact of aid workers sexually exploiting the most vulnerable people”. Aid organisations needed a “to be” list as well as a “to do” list, she said. The MP for Portsmouth North, who has banned aid applications from Oxfam until it can meet the high standards expected, said she would stop funding organisations that fail to do so. But she praised the “passionate, committed, tireless individuals” doing amazing work in the sector and said she remained committed to the 0.7% of GDP spend on aid. She told them: “I believe in you, in why you chose this career and in why you are here today. “Since the Oxfam scandal broke, you and UK aid have helped vaccinate around 1.5 million children from polio. That’s heroic. “But if we have the courage and the will to change we can do more.” She said it was important that the UK delivered on the sustainable development goals, for “the 10 million more children who will see their fifth birthday … and the 400 million more able to read and write”.Separately, Save the Children’s chief executive, Kevin Watkins, said he was “surprised” to read newspaper reports that he was forced to recuse himself from a review of the organisation’s handling of complaints of sexual misconduct. Watkins, who was a trustee of the charity for eight years, said that when he announced the review on 18 February he also advised that he would not be participating in it. “It would be completely inappropriate for the CEO and former trustee to do so,” he said. “The idea that I had to recuse myself has no basis in reality.” Watkins said he announced the internal review, of organisational culture at the charity, as part of his commitment to fixing the issues thrown up by recent misconduct allegations. Asked what he knew about claims of sexual harassment by senior figures when he was a trustee of the charity, Watkins told the Guardian: “When I was a trustee if I had felt there was improper process I would have resigned as a trustee. I had no grounds for believing there was an improper process.” He said: “But I’ve also made it clear that we need an independent review. The reason I set up the review was as a dispassionate diagnosis of where we are at.”",Aid; Global development; Penny Mordaunt; Politics; UK news,Global development
2018-04-24T09:23:27Z,Fashion Revolution Week: seven ways to get involved,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/apr/24/fashion-revolution-week-seven-ways-to-get-involved,"Five years ago, the issue of where our clothes come from went from being a matter of curiosity to something more urgent. It was on 24 April 2013 that the Rana Plaza disaster occurred on the outskirts of Dhaka in Bangladesh; more than 1,130 people died after the factory building in which they were working collapsed. The disaster galvanised Carry Somers and Orsola de Castro, co-founders of Fashion Revolution, into action. Fast-forward to now and it has grown into the world’s largest global fashion activism movement. Their campaign is simple. They are urging the industry to take more responsibility and show greater transparency in the supply chain. If brands do not know what is happening in the factories that supply them, if is difficult for them to improve conditions. Fashion Revolution asks one question: who made my clothes? There are many ways to support the campaign. By holding our favourite brands to account, it is possible to create change that minimises the risk of such a disaster recurring. Here are seven ways to get involved. Take a selfie and tag a brand Take a selfie showing the label from a piece of your clothing – or just take a picture of the label, if you are not a selfie fan – then post the image on social media with the hashtag #WhoMadeMyClothes in the caption. It is amazing how brands sit up and take notice. They might even be able to answer your question. Increasingly, companies are taking the issue of transparency seriously, but there is still a long way to go. “Too many people working in the fashion industry, mostly women, are still underpaid, unsafe and mistreated,” says Somers. “It’s time for change.” Dance your Fairtrade socks off The director MJ Delaney has made a short video to spread the Fashion Revolution message. It features music by Richie Fermie and choreography by Christopher Bordenave. You may already have seen Delaney’s work – she made What I Really Really Want, a remake of the Spice Girls’ Wannabe video promoting gender equality for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and last year’s follow-up for International Day of the Girl, to the soundtrack of Beyoncé’s Freedom. Delaney’s film For Fashion Revolution uses various styles of dance to represent each step of the complex journey of a piece of clothing from cotton field to factory floor. Rent your wardrobe Wear the Walk is the fashion equivalent of Netflix. Choose a one-off rental (starting at £30) for a special event, or a range of subscription services, starting at £60 per month, which allow you to choose two items and swap them each month (the fee includes dry-cleaning and insurance). This is a trend set to grow. According to a report by Allied Market, the global clothing rental market was worth $1bn (£700m) in 2017 and is estimated to reach $1.8bn by 2023. Of course, you can always freestyle. Make your wardrobe go further for free by taking part in swaps – there is one happening in Manchester on 27 April – or circulating parcels of clothes among your friends. Check out the tool kits to help you on your way at Global Fashion Exchange. Make something Fashion Open Studio is a Fashion Revolution initiative that is – full disclosure – curated by me. A week-long series of events, workshops and talks, it is the opposite of a catwalk show. The public are invited to designers’ studios, where they can talk about how they make clothes, learn skills and even try making their own. Highlights include a talk by Vivienne Westwood’s head of couture and a visit to the Kent HQ of Elvis &amp; Kresse, to see how they are working with the Burberry Foundation on finding creative solutions for working with leather offcuts. Alternatively, try a repairs workshop with Christopher Raeburn, quilting from waste with Phoebe English or making your own clutch with Katie Jones and Wool and the Gang. To sign up for an event, visit Fashion Open Studio. Get dressed De Castro says the small decisions we make every day are important. “Our wardrobes are a part of the fashion supply chain, so we can make a positive difference every morning when we get dressed,” she says. We have a responsibility to look after our clothes, wear them well, keep them in circulation and not throw them away after a few wears. We might even sew a button back on here and there; mend a hole. We need to treat our clothes with respect and keep them in circulation so that, ultimately, we buy less, waste less, reduce the amount of textiles we are sending to landfill. Glasgow School of Art is hosting MEND, a workshop to learn how to repair your clothes, on 24 April. Also, De Castro will be with recent fashion and textiles graduates Matthew Needham and Maddie Williams, showing how to think creatively with existing clothes at Barnardo’s Brixton DiscoMAKE in London on 26 April. Tickets are available on Eventbrite. Find brands you know you can trust and enjoy wearing them Truman Brewery in London will be a utopian parallel shopping universe this week, filled with brands and clothes you can trust. Organised by fair trade activist and pioneer Safia Minney, the founder of People Tree and now the CEO of vegan footwear brand Po-Zu shoes, there will be events, talks and guilt-free shopping. While you are there, you can invest in a pair of Po-Zu’s linen and pineapple “leather” sneakers, along with the latest collections by People Tree, knitwear by Lowie and menswear by Brothers We Stand. Ask any of them who made the clothes and they will be able to tell you. We hope that one day this will be the norm. For times and details of events, visit the Facebook page. Sign the fashion manifesto To mark its fifth anniversary, Fashion Revolution launched its manifesto during Fashion Question Time at the Houses of Parliament on 23 April. It covers everything from fair and equal pay to freedom of association for all workers to cultural diversity and transparency and accountability across the entire chain. De Castro says: “We want your signature to be a part of a global legacy, so that every time something is unjust, or people are exploited and the environment is degraded, you can reach back to it and reiterate that you can’t stand for abuse, you signed the manifesto, you are ready for change.”",Fashion; Life and style,Fashion
2018-06-28T15:17:13Z,Biodiversity is the 'infrastructure that supports all life',https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2018/jun/28/biodiversity-is-the-infrastructure-that-supports-all-life,"Dr. Cristiana Pașca Palmer has a big job ahead of her: planning the 2020 UN Biodiversity Convention in Beijing. As the Executive Secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), Pașca Palmer is in charge of forming new goals with governments for the natural world post-2020. At the same time, a growing group of scientists are calling for a serious consideration of the Half Earth idea – where half the planet would be placed under various types of protection in a bid to prevent mass extinction. Do you support the Half Earth model? What tweaks would you make to it? “Half Earth”, a concept coined by the distinguished professor E.O Wilson advocates that we need to conserve half of the Earth’s lands and seas, in order to avoid species extinction. This idea sparked a vivid debate. Questions that I see surfacing frequently in these discussions ask – “What about humans? And what do we do with the ‘other Half? Could we continue to use the planet unsustainably, as long as half of it is conserved?” In my view, we need to ensure that the entire planet is used sustainably. That is, 100% of the Earth, the “Whole Earth”, has to be managed in a way that will allow continuous healthy functioning of the ecological systems that support life on Earth, including human life. We can think of biological diversity as the “infrastructure” that supports all life on the planet. When we lose species through extinction the web of life is destroyed and this in turn affects the resilience of the ecosystems and nature’s capacity to provide the services that humans benefit from – ensuring our food, the air we breath, the water we drink, or the moments of peace and serenity we enjoy in nature. Conservation and protection of nature, ecosystems, and species is one essential pillar of any strategy to ensure fully functional natural systems in the long term. Ecological restoration of degraded lands through natural means should be another key component. Ultimately, the paradigm shift that perhaps is necessary is the wide-understanding that the Earth is one system of interconnected elements, and that humans’ social and economic systems are embedded in the larger nature’s system, and not the other way around. A transformation of the way we produce, consume, and generally, interact with nature should therefore be another pillar of a long-term sustainable approach to ensure nature’s health, which is an essential condition for our survival and well-being on the planet. Ambitious, science-based targets are needed to guide the way in conserving and restoring the Earth. A couple of recent papers have suggested that the CBD push for a new agreement in 2020 that would be similar to the Paris Climate Agreement to ratchet up conservation targets and funding. Is this something that the CBD is actively considering? All 196 parties that are signatories of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity adopted the 2050 vision of “Living in harmony with nature.” We have made progress towards this goal but a lot more remains to be done. This ‘road to 2050’ has several important milestones – the design of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework is one of them, along with the implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which have 2030 as deadline. The current 20 global biodiversity targets (Aichi targets) are embedded and reflected in most of the 17 SDGs; thus, it is expected that achieving the SDGs will also benefit biodiversity. There is also an increasing global recognition of the urgency of action needed to protect biodiversity – to shift to new ways of production and consumption and reorient economic development pathways towards an “economy within ecological boundaries.” Governments are already starting their work to develop an ambitious post-2020 architecture for biodiversity that is transformative but also achievable. We hope this framework, that will be adopted by the global community at the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) of the UN Biodiversity Convention hosted by China in Beijing in 2020, will provide new impetus to the way we conserve and manage Earth’s natural capital. We expect both the governments and other relevant stakeholders from the business sector and civil society to make their specific and strong commitments towards implementing the post-2020 agenda and achieving the 2050 vision of living in harmony with nature. What are the political roadblocks to taking much more ambitious action to save life on Earth? How do you propose to overcome these? The first major structural roadblock is the current global economic and development model which does not account for natural capital and does not consider the ecosystem services provided by biodiversity as a fundamental part of the economic system. We need to fundamentally change this paradigm and shift to an economic model that accounts for the fact that we operate within a closed system – planet Earth – and that our economic growth is limited by the ecological limits of the planet, also known as “planetary boundaries.” The second roadblock is the ‘short-termism’ structurally embedded in the current political decision-making processes. Many environmental considerations and conservation actions are of a long-term nature, going beyond the usual political and election cycles of few years. We need thus long-term planning for the way we use nature’s capital, rooted in the fundamental planetary and human needs and informed by the science on ‘planetary boundaries’. Building a bridge between science and policy-making is crucial. Long-term vision grounded in solid science and short-term, practical, implementation action needs to be at the heart of our decision-making. And the third major roadblock, ticking at the intersection of the political reality and culture, is the dominant concept of human separation from and supremacy over nature. This misconception underpinning in large measure the modern views and attitudes towards nature is at the root of people’s disconnect from nature and the fragmentation we see in environmental governance and policy-making. Significant changes are required in our mentalities – as decision makers, producers, and consumers. Awareness and education are essential for building a common, widely internalised understanding that our planet’s resources for supporting life are finite. How do we significantly increase funding worldwide for conservation protection? Current funding resources for conservation are disproportionally low and fragmented compared to the needs. Creative and more innovative means of finance and resource mobilisation have to be explored to unlock the necessary resources to implement the Convention’s objectives post-2020. Blending public and private finance, innovative green finance, and biodiversity insurance facilities are just few examples. On the other hand, the impact of economic activity on nature and environment could be mitigated by making conservation an integral part of every industrial or other type of projects that may have potential adverse impacts on the environment. This process, called ‘internalisation of externalities,’ follows the principle of sustainable use of resources and allows for a ecosystems, holistic, approach to managing Earth’s natural capital. The cheapest way of doing conservation is investing in the prevention of harmful effects and in building safeguards against major adverse impacts. Switching to sustainable consumption and production, applying the principles of circular economy, eco-design and zero waste are modern approaches in this regard. The money could flow from simply redirecting the funding from ‘nature-ignorant’ decisions to ‘nature-savvy’ decisions and mainstreaming biodiversity in key economic sectors, such as agriculture, fisheries, tourism, forestry, infrastructure, health and manufacturing, as already proposed under the provisions of the Biodiversity Convention. Additionally, investing in biodiversity conservation is a cost-effective way to maintain ecosystems resilience and mitigate the impacts to climate change. Ultimately, investing in biodiversity is beneficial for social and economic development. Or, as some say, “green is the new gold.” For the protection of very specific, sensitive, or in crisis ecosystems or species, the funds should be provided through a comprehensive, holistic mix of sources from public and private finance, philanthropy and even crowdsourcing. Finally, the quality and efficiency of the way financial resources are used is just as important as the quantity. Partnerships with civil society, local communities and indigenous people are effective ways to maximise investments and deliver good results for conservation in the long run.",Environment; Biodiversity; Conservation; United Nations; Wildlife; World news; Animals; Science,Environment
2018-10-12T14:00:06Z,Mary Robinson on climate change: ‘Feeling “This is too big for me” is no use to anybody’,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/12/mary-robinson-climate-change-former-president-ireland-ipcc-report,"On the morning that the world’s leading climate scientists warn that the planet has until 2030 to avert a global warming catastrophe, Mary Robinson appears suitably sombre. She wears black shoes, black trousers and a black sweater and perches at the end of a long table at her climate justice foundation, headquartered in an austere, imposing Georgian building opposite Trinity College Dublin. The only dash of brightness is a multicoloured brooch on her lapel. “It symbolises the sustainable development goals,” she says. “It’s the one good emblem that the United Nations has produced, so I like to wear it.” There seems little reason for cheer on this Monday. The landmark report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has just warned that urgent, unprecedented changes are needed to keep global warming to a maximum of 1.5C; even half a degree beyond this will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. Donald Trump, rejecter of the Paris climate agreement, is riding high on the back of Brett Kavanaugh’s elevation to the US supreme court. Britain and the EU are consumed by Brexit. Brazil is on course to elect a president who wants to open the Amazon to agribusiness. Closer to home, the Irish government is flunking its climate policy goals. Now, climate scientists warn that the clock ticks ever closer to midnight. “Governments are not responding at all adequately to the stark reality that the IPCC is pointing to: that we have about 11 years to make really significant change,” says Robinson, sitting ramrod straight, all business. “This report is extraordinarily important, because it’s telling us that 2 degrees is not safe. It’s beyond safe. Therefore, we have to work much, much harder to stay at 1.5 degrees. I’ve seen what 1 degree is doing in more vulnerable countries ... villages are having to move, there’s slippage, there’s seawater incursion.” Robinson sips a glass of water and sighs. “We’re in a bumpy time. We’re in a bad political cycle, particularly because the United States is not only not giving leadership, but is being disruptive of multilateralism and is encouraging populism in other countries.” This could be the start of a depressing interview that concludes we should hitch a ride on Virgin Galactic’s first trip to space and try to stay there. But it turns out to be surprisingly upbeat. Despite the headlines, Robinson, who served as the UN secretary general’s special envoy on climate change after serving as the president of Ireland and the UN high commissioner for human rights, is hopeful. She has anticipated the IPCC report by writing a book-cum-manifesto, Climate Justice: Hope, Resilience and the Fight for a Sustainable Future, published this week. It tells stories of farmers and activists, mostly women, who tackle climate change in Africa, Asia and the Americas. They are examples of positive change that Robinson thinks can help turn the tide. “I don’t think as a human race that we can be so stupid that we can’t face an existential threat together and find a common humanity and solidarity to respond to it. Because we do have the capacity and the means to do it – if we have the political will.” Climate change may be man-made, but Robinson believes women are key to the solution, through planting trees, recycling waste, eating less meat and a thousand other measures, big and small. “There’s a nurturing quality, a concern for children, that’s very deep in women. And women change behaviour. It’s women who decide what the diet will be. And, of course, in vulnerable countries, it’s women who bear the brunt of climate change.” The former barrister karate-chops the air for emphasis. “I’ve learned from Archbishop Desmond Tutu to be a ‘prisoner of hope’, a great expression that he uses. That means the glass may not be half full, but there’s something in the glass that you work on. Hope brings energy.” So, while the Trump administration withholds leadership and money from the global effort for clean energy – “That’s where it hurts” – the US may yet meet Paris emissions targets, thanks to efforts by We Are Still In, a coalition of mayors, governors, tribal leaders, colleges, businesses, faith groups and investors that is continuing to follow the terms of the agreement. The movement to divestment from fossil fuels is also making progress. “They’ve now moved to trillions being divested. That’s very significant.” Grim scientific prognoses must not paralyse civil society, says Robinson. It must unite, march, organise, pressure politicians. “Feeling a complete inability to do anything – ‘This is too big for me, I give up’ – that’s no use to anybody. [With] despair, all the energy to do something goes out of the room.” Robinson says she is adapting her own behaviour: fewer flights and more teleconferencing; eating less meat as an “aspirant vegetarian”; using public transport, although she confesses to taking taxis frequently. “I talk to the taxi drivers, that’s my compensation. I get them to message for me. Ten years ago, taxi drivers were the most sceptical about climate change. Now, they’re the most keen to get an electric car, or at least a hybrid.” At the age of 73, Robinson has carved out a new role in public life. No longer a high-powered global bureaucrat with a big budget and staff, no longer a head of state trailed by pomp, she instead relies on a formidable intellect, her brand name and her social and political network. You could call it soft power, except Robinson does not do soft. She is friendly and courteous, but the famous iron-grip handshake is still there; so too her antiphathy towards smalltalk. The gaze is direct, the sentences exact. When I go off-topic and ask about Brexit, or the Irish presidential election, there is a tight smile. “We’re straying far from the book, aren’t we?” Supporters and critics have long noted a personal stiffness matched by an unbending commitment to liberal principles. How else would a GP’s daughter from Ballina, County Mayo, emerge in the 1970s as a law professor and outspoken advocate for women’s rights and contraception while other politicians genuflected before the might of the country’s Roman Catholic church? She was denounced from the pulpit and had condoms sent to her in the post. Nominated by the Labour party as a long-shot candidate for the presidency in 1990, she won. It was an astonishing result that prefigured Ireland’s social liberalisation. It enshrined Robinson as a progressive talisman. Kofi Annan tapped her up to become the UN’s high commissioner for human rights in 1997, three months before her presidential term ended. It was a rare misstep. She has expressed regret for letting the then secretary general “sort of bully” her into leaving the presidency early to head to Geneva. Later, George W Bush’s administration bristled at her stance on human rights, Palestine and other issues after 9/11, which contributed to her stepping down in 2002. A year later, Robinson found herself in a Dublin maternity ward holding her first grandchild, Rory. “I was flooded with a sense of adrenaline, a physical sensation unlike anything I had ever felt before,” she writes in Climate Justice. “In that moment, my sense of time altered and I began to think in a time span of a hundred years. I knew instinctively that I would now view Rory’s life through the prism of our planet’s precarious future ... the abstract data on climate change that I had skirted around for so long became deeply personal.” Robinson was struck by the injustice that those least responsible, such as islanders in Kiribati or herders in Kenya, suffered most from climate change, and by the fact that much of the world ignored scientists’ warnings. Her response is to tell the stories of people such as Sharon Hanshaw, a hairdresser in Mississippi who led community recovery efforts after Hurricane Katrina; Constance Okollet, a Ugandan farmer who taught neighbours to plant trees to stop topsoil erosion; and Natalie Isaacs, an Australian entrepreneur who launched an online initiative to help households curb their carbon footprints. “I try to illustrate the hope and the fightback,” says Robinson. “And the need for empathy. We need to have empathy now with those who are suffering ... because that’s where we’ll all be very shortly if we don’t change course.” Robinson wanted to do a documentary to accompany the book, but she was advised instead to do a podcast. “Being of my generation, I said: ‘What’s a podcast?’” she laughs. She agreed. Thus was born an unlikely phenomenon: Mary Robinson, comedian. The former president co-hosts the podcast Mothers of Invention with Maeve Higgins, an Irish comedian based in New York. They banter while discussing climate change and interviewing guests. “People listen through Maeve, through her questions. It’s making it much more real. There’s no doubt that Maeve is drawing me to the dark side. I’m getting funnier because of that.” Higgins does the comedic heavy lifting, riffing and throwing out lines while Robinson plays the straight foil. “I’ve learned that young people now in the United States get their politics from comical programmes,” says Robinson. She alludes to The Daily Show, but mixes up Jon Stewart with Jimmy Stewart and Trevor Noah with Trevor Nunn, which is actually pretty funny. Robinson considers comedy a sensible response to existential threat. “Laughter in a very serious discussion is much more persuasive than if we were all the time serious, serious, serious.” I consider asking her to tell a joke, but my nerve fails; back to business. “We have 11 years to change course and it has to be done with a seriousness of purpose, particularly by governments, because they determine the rules.” Preparations for a conference in Poland in December to ensure implementation of the Paris agreement are not going well, she says: “There’s a lot of arguing around what needs to be done.” She hopes the IPCC report will focus minds. “Future governments won’t be able to do what governments now have 11 years to do. In the future, we will have these tipping points – the Arctic will be gone, the coral reefs will be gone, the permafrost will be dissolving ... all these things will just spin us out of control.” Governments need to end fossil fuel subsidies and increase tax on carbon, she says. “Put a real price on carbon and do it now. These are the levers that move things quickly and get the investment into clean energy. If governments are not capable of being more serious, then they lack moral leadership, which is what we really need now.” Leaving aside the rest of the world, the country outside Robinson’s door challenges her optimism. When Irish civil society marches these days, it is for housing, not climate change. The government hinted that it would increase carbon tax in this week’s budget, but it did not. Climate change has barely registered in the presidential election. Robinson seems unabashed. “In my experience, human rights has always been a struggle. We don’t always keep going forward; there are setbacks and then you dig deeper. You get the prisoner-of-hope mentality and you fight harder.” Climate Justice: Hope, Resilience and the Fight for a Sustainable Future is out now (Bloomsbury, £16.99).

2018-01-02T12:20:39Z,We must declare 2018 the year of the right to housing | Leilani Farha,https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2018/jan/02/2018-global-housing-crisis-us-canada-homelessness,"We are at a critical moment. Globally, housing conditions have never been this fraught. Most governments, national and local alike, insist on privileging the interests of a few over the needs of the many. As a result, homelessness and its accompanying death toll are on the rise, while the number of vacant homes owned by corporate and high net worth investors continues to grow. Affluent countries stand as some of the worst examples. Last year, on an average night in the US, more than 550,000 people slept rough. One county in Silicon Valley saw a 164% increase in deaths of homeless people between 2011 and 2015, rising from 50 to 135. In Toronto, Canada’s largest city, the first nine months of 2017 saw 70 homeless deaths, the highest figure on record. Meanwhile, investor homes sit empty: London reported 20,000 empty homes in 2016 and data from Australia indicates a whopping 1m vacant homes. In most cities, unregulated real estate speculation and commodification is making housing unaffordable even for the middle class, with those providing essential services, like nurses and firefighters, unable to live in the cities where they work. With no other options, more than 1 billion people worldwide have resorted to living in informal settlements, encampments or on the streets without secure tenure or basic services. Most disturbing of all is that these realities seem to be accepted as a fixed feature of our global socioeconomic order. But before concluding that the world is going to hell in a handbasket, let’s recall that just two years ago, the world’s governments recognised these conditions as unsustainable and responded. In committing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are “unequivocally anchored in human rights”, world governments undertook to ensure access to adequate, secure and affordable housing for all by 2030. By necessity, the SDGs catapult housing to centre stage. To meet this ambitious commitment, governments will have to design housing strategies based on human rights. In light of the global scale and depth of homelessness and inadequate housing, and the roots of these problems in the failure of governments to regulate the financialisation of housing, it is no longer reasonable for governments to treat these realities as mere policy or programme failures. Homelessness and inadequate housing are violations of human rights – and demand the appropriate response. Rights-based housing strategies are not one-size fits all, but there are some key requirements that can be shaped to fit national and local contexts. As a starting point, housing strategies must guarantee that no one is left behind, which, among other things, means they must commit to ending homelessness by 2030. This also means housing strategies must go well beyond the provision of housing. Strategies must have structural change as their ambition. They must aim to transform societies where economic policies and housing systems create and sustain inequality and exclusion, into societies in which housing is a means to ensure security and inclusion. There are fundamental shifts that rights-based strategies must effect in order to be successful. Strategies must transform how governments, at all levels, interact with those who are homeless and inadequately housed. Instead of viewing them as needy beneficiaries, objectsof charity, or, worse, as criminals, they must instead recognise that people who are homeless also have rights – and are active citizens who should be involved in decisions affecting their lives. This would ensure that strategies respond to people’s own experiences. Strategies must also transform the relationship between governments and the financial sector. Because most governments rely extensively on the private sector to meet housing needs, strategies must ensure that human rights implementation is the overriding goal of all investment in housing and residential real estate, and that the primacy of housing’s social function is never a subsidiary or neglected obligation. One wonders if this is possible when the commitment to the human rights imperative is being challenged by governments themselves – and when, for instance, the UN commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, says he cannot continue in his job because the current geopolitical context is a threat to his integrity and independence. And the biggest assault on human rights is coming from Donald Trump, a real estate tycoon whose fortunes have been made from the rampant commodification of housing. This does not bode well for the future of the right to housing or that of the people living in conditions that challenge human dignity and life itself. But as we head into a new year, our choice is to either be complacent and allow our cities to become the playgrounds of the rich while the rest of us are priced out of our homes; or to recognise the urgent need for action, and declare 2018 the year of the right to housing, and every year thereafter, until governments are held accountable, cities become inclusive, and our housing accessible, secure, and affordable. I choose the latter. Sign up for your free Guardian Housing network newsletter with comment and sector views sent direct to you on the last Friday of the month.

2018-03-01T22:56:04Z,We need to talk about peace again | Scott Ludlam,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/02/we-need-to-talk-about-peace-again,"A cruise liner is not the first place you’d go looking for conflict prevention, sustainability education, disarmament diplomacy and international collaborations on everything from disaster relief to low-carbon marine transport. From the outside, the Ocean Dream looks like any other 32,000 tonne ocean liner; a long, seafaring apartment block slung with lifeboats, navigation equipment bristling from the top terraces. There are a few hints at something out of the ordinary though; the ship is splashed with huge logos for the UN Sustainable Development Goals and Ican, the disarmament insurgency that burst into public consciousness when it won the Nobel Peace Prize in late 2017. And then there are the words “Peace Boat” emblazoned in letters four metres high down the flank of the ship. Did you wince inwardly, even a little, at the name? In more fortunate parts of the world, peace fell out of fashion some time ago; the disintegration of the old Soviet Union, dramatic downsizing of nuclear weapon stockpiles, the eternal triumph of the global capitalist order; all of these things seemed to render the “peace” movement cheerfully redundant. The previous generation won a belated end to atmospheric nuclear weapons testing and the slaughter in Vietnam. Made major progress on the restriction and abolition of chemical and biological weapons, land mines, cluster bombs. And then, disaster. George Bush marched blindly, pig-headedly into Iraq. Millions mobilised globally to try and prevent catastrophe. We failed. Bush, Howard, Blair, the weapons contractors, oil industry and much of the establishment media knew best. Now each act of barbarity plants the seeds of the next. Iraq, Libya, Syria, endless bloodshed in Afghanistan, the incomprehensible disaster of Yemen. A bleak procession of prime ministers and presidents continue to announce new campaigns to launch precision-guided munitions at the avalanching consequences of their previous announcements. At last we’ve reached the null point of this dismal regression: a spoon-fed narcissist with launch authority over thousands of hydrogen bombs. He seems baffled as to why he shouldn’t use them on the people of Korea, and he’s clearly not the only one. Malcolm Turnbull announced that he was “joined at the hip” to this individual, which would be a queasy metaphor at the best of times. These are not the best of times. We need to talk about peace again. More than 30 years ago, a group of Japanese uni students, alarmed at the textbook whitewashing of Imperial Japan’s wartime atrocities, took matters into their own hands. They chartered a small ship, packed it with students, and began taking themselves to places where Japan’s name was the blackest: Nanjing, Hong Kong, Singapore, out into the Pacific. Not to justify, but to try and understand, to apologise, and to work for the prevention of future barbarity. And so Peace Boat was born. The first round-the-world trip was undertaken in 1990. In 1995 the organisation played a frontline role in disaster relief after the Great Hanshin earthquake that wrecked Kobe. In 2002, reflecting its growing importance as a Japanese non-government organisation, it gained special consultative status with the Economic and Social Council of the UN. In an average year it runs three global voyages and two regional voyages, each carrying a thousand passengers. After the Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami overwhelmed the Tohoku region in 2011, the organisation formalised its role as an emergency responder, deploying its volunteer network deep into the stricken area to supply food and emergency supplies and assist economic reconstruction. Along the way, this radical social enterprise collaboration somehow became Japan’s largest cruising organisation. Don’t come for the luxury boutiques or the on-board casino; they tore them out and replaced them with organising spaces; the cabaret lounges repurposed for lectures and activist cinema. You still get exquisitely daggy décor and a small piano bar that looks to be composed entirely of pianos, but the vessel is now configured for a quite different kind of work. Venues pack out among this willingly captive audience; at any given time there are half a dozen events on the go, hosted by guest lecturers, journalists, activists, or self-organised by paying passengers with their own life experience to share. A volunteer translation team works late into the night preparing an adorable daily newspaper in as many languages as the passenger cohort requires. Language is taken just as seriously by day; the ship has its own school if you want to learn a new one, because of course it does. Through simultaneous translation you and 500 others can sit and listen as a dapper Japanese elder relays his memory of the day he found himself less than 2km from the hypocentre of a fission bomb as it blew Hiroshima apart. His life’s work is now dedicated to preventing that from happening to anyone else. Coming out of a darkened lecture theatre, having permanently memorised the history written into the lines of his face, and the wide ocean is right there. Endless, horizon to horizon, changing in tone and temper as we slowly traverse timezones. Thirty kilometres an hour, hour after hour. An international peace university, but one that moves. As you’d imagine, it is in port where the real genius of the project is expressed. In the Australian tour just concluded, Japanese bomb-survivors and Fukushima evacuees shared stories of defiance and dispossession with Aboriginal land rights campaigners and environmental defenders from around the country. On board, we covered everything from the emergence of the hard-right in Australia and Japan, to campaigns for LGBTI rights and how Aboriginal women from South Australia are starting to lose count of the radioactive waste dumps they’ve been called on to defeat. Hundreds of people attended “Making Waves” meetings in Australia’s southern capitals to hear how the UN nuclear ban treaty is transforming from lines on paper into genuine momentum for disarmament; the first real sign of progress and hope in decades. Peace is back. In other ports on other nights around our beleaguered world, other themes. The ship has been used as neutral space for peace-building between young Palestinians and Israelis. Dialogue between people caught on both sides of the Korean DMZ, meetings with diplomats and foreign ministers, a global youth ambassador programme, research into our rapidly changing oceans. The dissonance of people riding around on a passenger ship burning marine diesel oil and lecturing others about marine pollution hasn’t escaped the organisers; it has instead inspired an ambition that I took at first glance to be science fiction. An eco-ship, presently under construction in a shipyard in Helsinki. Expected delivery date is 2020: a bio-designed liner featuring solar sails, closed loop water systems and giant indoor gardens that help feed the ship, consume organic waste and clean the air. We’re in an age when ambition is called for. It’s not perfect, but a step along the way; something more than a gesture to the closed-loop economy that beckons a world that deserves better than war without end. Peace Boat will be back in Australia before long. If you’re done with empire’s ceaseless appetite for high-technology carnage, you’ll find good company among the global networks of local people who are still working, even after all this time, to give peace a chance.

2019-04-30T05:00:14Z,Busting the myth that depression doesn't affect people in poor countries,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/30/busting-the-myth-that-depression-doesnt-affect-people-in-poor-countries,"When Vikram Patel first began to study mental health, he believed depression only existed in rich nations. But today, he is the single most influential figure in the growing global movement to treat mental illness in poor countries, especially the most common disorder, depression. In 1993, Patel, who was born in Mumbai, finished his training as a psychiatrist in London and moved with his wife to Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, to begin a two-year research fellowship at the national university. His purpose was to find evidence for the view, then widespread among psychiatrists, that what looked like depression in poor countries was actually a response to deprivation and injustice – conditions stemming from colonisation. The remedy in such cases, he believed, was not psychotherapy, but social justice. Patel began his work by holding focus-group interviews with traditional healers and others who cared for patients with mental illness, and then by interviewing patients. He asked them what mental illness was, what caused it, and how to treat it. The most common illness had a name: kufungisisa, a word in Shona, the local language, which means excessive worry about a problem. Many of the healers said kufungisisa was not an illness, but a reaction to the stresses of life, such as poverty or illness. Aha! Patel thought. It was as he expected: in Zimbabwe, mental suffering was being caused by social injustice. But when Patel asked patients how kufungisisa felt, the answers were familiar. No matter what they called it, no matter what they held to be the reason or the cure, they cited hopelessness, exhaustion, inability to confront their problems and a lack of interest in life – classic signs of depression. “They were identifying the same symptoms as people I would treat in a clinic in south London,” Patel said. Far from exposing depression as a uniquely western phenomenon, Patel’s research in Zimbabwe led him to conclude that depression is a fundamental human experience. “The basic nature of emotional pain is no different than physical pain,” he said. “The way they seek help may be different, but human beings feel it in the same way.” While Patel was in Zimbabwe, the World Bank in Washington was conducting a landmark project that would transform global health. For the first time, data was being used to make decisions about preventing and treating illnesses around the world. In order to know how best to allocate international aid, bank officials decided they needed to know what humans suffer from. What kills us? Sickens us? Causes us to live less than fully? Analysing data that had been gathered from around the world three years earlier, researchers published a study called The Global Burden of Disease, 1990. (Such mapping now happens continuously, involving thousands of researchers.) The results shocked doctors and policymakers. Earlier such projects had tracked only deaths, not disease. While mental illness is a factor in many deaths, it is almost never listed on death certificates, so it barely even registered in previous reports. Now, for the first time, researchers went beyond deaths to examine the global causes of illness and disability. They found that the single largest cause of disability worldwide was mental disorders – largely, the common illnesses of depression and anxiety. They caused a seventh of all the disability in the world. In the poorest countries as well as the richest, and at every socioeconomic level in between, mental disorders were the greatest thief of productive life. The consequences of this were catastrophic. Patients in south London had a shot at seeing any number of psychologists or psychiatrists. But the treatment typically given to sufferers of depression in wealthier countries was completely out of reach for hundreds of millions of people who needed it. Poor countries spent virtually no money on mental health. “I was astonished to find that there were just 10 psychiatrists in Zimbabwe,” said Patel, who is now Pershing Square professor of global health at Harvard Medical school. “Eight of them were in Harare. And of the 10, eight were foreigners like me.” Those psychiatrists spent their time treating the few patients wealthy enough to pay. The situation was similar in other poor countries. In 2005, the World Health Organization reported that a number of countries – including Afghanistan, Rwanda, Chad, Eritrea and Liberia – had just one or two psychiatrists in the whole country. Training the tens of thousands of traditional mental health professionals that countries such as Afghanistan and Zimbabwe needed was impossible, Patel feared. But there was a more radical solution. * * * For most of the 20th century, the view that “mental health” was exclusively a problem of the wealthier west was widely held by doctors, mental health professionals and cultural theorists. JC Carothers, a psychiatrist and consultant to the WHO, represented one typical branch of this belief. In 1953, he published an influential paper on the “African mind”, in which he argued that the continent’s inhabitants lacked the psychological development and sense of personal responsibility necessary to experience depression. Even by the late 1990s, versions of this thinking survived. There was a heated debate going on in the US about whether the triggers for depression in wealthier countries could possibly have the same effect among the world’s poor, recalled Melanie Abas, a reader in global mental health at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp; Neuroscience at King’s College London. Abas characterised the sceptics’ position as: “If your baby died and you had seven already, you didn’t experience it in the same way.” Curiously, many people with leftist views arrived at the same dismissal of the need for mental health care, although via different routes. Critics of colonialism argued that calling what looked like depression an illness needing treatment was an act of western cultural hegemony: it medicalised experiences that were not considered illnesses and were dealt with perfectly well by the local culture. Others believed that the more communal nature of society and the stronger family ties in poor countries inoculated people against depression, which was linked to the loneliness, stress and materialistic culture of western life. Still others acknowledged the existence of depression, but argued that treating it was a luxury: surely people with no food or shelter have more important things to worry about. The implication of all of these views was that people in poor countries didn’t need the sort of counselling often prescribed for sufferers of depression in the west. We now know that they need it desperately. Abas has spent much of her career in Zimbabwe; in the 1990s, she treated patients at Harare Psychiatric hospital and, even before Patel did, documented extensive depression. Some of her research looked at the relationship between depression and life’s tragedies. She found that severe events, such as the death of a child, were as likely to cause depression in a poor woman in Harare as they were in an affluent Londoner. “But women in Zimbabwe faced many more such events in a year,” Abas said. Before working in Zimbabwe, Patel had believed that depression was simply an appropriate response to adversity. Your husband drinks and beats you. Your crop failed. Your family is homeless. Your children are hungry. Of course you are sad. You and your family need treatment for alcoholism, fertiliser subsidies, stable employment. What does psychotherapy have to do with it? Sadness is an appropriate response to adversity. But depression is not the same. (While the poor are more likely to be depressed, the vast majority of the poor are not, so poverty alone does not lead to depression.) Depression is a fog of negative thoughts that debilitate and paralyse the sufferer so she cannot respond to terrible events. “The question is how quickly you are able to get past distressing emotions so they don’t themselves acquire an independent effect on your life, and become a problem in themselves,” Patel said. “If your negative thoughts are coming in the way of solving a problem, if your sleeplessness affects work – that is compounding whatever triggered it.” The disability caused by depression is actually much wider-ranging than the data from World Bank’s 1993 report suggested, because the numbers only measured depression’s direct effect on health. But depression also takes a huge indirect toll. It makes other diseases much worse. People who are depressed are more likely to get other illnesses, and less likely to be treated successfully. Depressed patients, for example, do not take their HIV medicine, and are less able to support their families or take care of others: babies of depressed mothers often aren’t well nurtured and fail to thrive. Far from a luxury, treating depression is often a necessary first step towards solving other problems. Addressing poverty sometimes brings about a small improvement in people’s mental health, said Kari Frame, the programme director at Strong Minds, an organisation that helps depressed women in Uganda treat their illness by forming self-help groups. But addressing mental health very often leads to a big decrease in poverty. * * * In 2007, Patel and several other experts published a series of articles on global mental health that inaugurated a profound change in approaches to treatment worlwide. The series, in the prominent British medical journal The Lancet, warned that mental health disorders are neglected and stigmatised, and pointed to the critical shortage in mental health care. This was – and still is – true in rich countries: more than half of Americans who need treatment don’t get it, for example. But in poor countries, virtually no one was getting the care they needed. In low- and low-middle-income countries, budgets for mental health treatment were less than 3% of an already meagre health provision. Most of that went to institutions housing people with severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. Such institutions were almost always understaffed, manned by poorly trained workers and dedicated to containing rather than treating their patients, using methods that often amounted to torture. Depression and anxiety got no treatment at all. The Lancet articles proposed a massive expansion of mental health treatment worldwide. Richard Horton, the Lancet’s editor, urged people to join a new social movement to provide effective care for the world’s neediest populations. “The time to act is now,” the authors wrote. Psychiatrists and psychologists were costly to train and pay. And how would poor countries keep them? Medical professionals often studied at their government’s expense – and then emigrated, to practise in North America or Europe. The Lancet writers noted that one of the most important trends in global health was shifting tasks from professionals to lay people. Community health workers, who offer basic health information and services in the communities where they live, were not new – China’s “barefoot doctors” programme of the late 1960s was one example – but they had fallen out of favour. In the early 2000s, however, there was a resurgence of interest. Developing countries were training and paying (albeit poorly) millions of community health workers to teach nutrition, weigh babies, treat pneumonia and organise campaigns to clean up standing water. Lay health workers didn’t deal with depression, but there was no reason they couldn’t, Patel and his colleagues argued. For all the suffering it causes, it turns out that diagnosing and treating many episodes of depression is actually not that complex. To see the role that a lay person could play in addressing depression, I visited Santa Cruz high school in the Indian state of Goa. In September 2016, Mamta Verma set up a table and two plastic chairs in a crammed storeroom, and installed herself there on Monday and Wednesday mornings. For the first time, the school could offer its students counselling. Verma exudes gentleness and warmth. She had studied psychology in college, and was getting her master’s degree through distance learning. But she was not a psychologist yet – and that was the whole point. If she were, she wouldn’t be working in a storeroom at a high school. She was testing a new programme created by Sangath, a Goa-based organisation founded by Patel and six colleagues in 1996. Sangath – the name means “together” in Konkani, the official language of Goa – designs and studies ways to make mental health care as cheap and accessible as possible. When a programme works, Sangath then chips away at it to see how much it can shed without sacrificing results. If eight weeks of counselling bring success, how about six weeks? Could group therapy leaders get two weeks’ training instead of four? If someone with a high school education is leading the group, what about a community health worker with less education – or none? If the patient is a child, can his parents learn to deliver the therapy? While I sat in her storeroom, a steady stream of students visited Verma to talk about parents who fight, classmates who bully, anger management, boy trouble, their weight, their skin, their concentration, their difficulties in Hindi or maths. Verma uses a workbook featuring Priyanka and Ajay, two fictional teenagers with typical teenage issues. Verma asked students to analyse what Priyanka and Ajay were facing and come up with solutions for them to try. Then the students applied these techniques to their own problems. This method is called problem-solving therapy. Sangath is by far the most influential research organisation on mental health care in poor countries. It has 300 employees and fellows, and has published dozens of studies, many of which describe real breakthroughs in care. People visit from around the world to learn Sangath’s strategies for preventing or treating conditions such as postnatal depression, problem drinking, schizophrenia, depression in the elderly, stress in people with HIV and their caregivers, and teen depression and behaviour problems. All of these strategies involve lay therapists like Verma, and many use a version of the sort of problem-solving therapy she applies. One example is Sangath’s health activity programme. The organisation trained lay people to give around eight weekly sessions of counselling to patients suffering from severe depression. The focus is helping patients stop doing things that make them feel bad – staying in bed, neglecting personal hygiene – and start doing healthy activities, such as talking to friends, engaging in hobbies or taking a walk. Counsellors also ask patients to brainstorm possible solutions to their problems, pick the best one and try it. It seems absurdly simple, but three months later, the patients who had been through just that brief programme were 64% more likely to be in remission than those that hadn’t. Abas, the Institute for Psychiatry reader, said that although Sangath has been seminal, its approach to depression focuses too narrowly on single episodes. “Depression for most people is really a chronic illness,” she said. “I don’t think they’ve done enough to emphasise that. It’s important to get treatment when you’re really low, but if this relapses, what next?” For most patients in wealthy countries, what’s next – or often what’s first – is an antidepressant. Abas points out that medicines are curiously absent from the global mental health movement. “It’s become very fashionable to talk about talk therapy,” she said. “A lot of people do really well with it. But some are too unwell to even start. If you are very depressed and your brain is shutting down, are you even able to talk?” * * * In the 12 years since Patel and his colleagues published their groundbreaking series of articles, global mental health has become a movement. When they were drafted in 2000, the UN’s millennium development goals for 2015 made no mention of mental health. Now, “mental health care for all” is a pillar of the UN sustainable development goals for 2030. Dozens of low-cost mental health care projects have sprung up around the world. Various networks, including the Mental Health Innovation Network, help them share information and ideas. But an archipelago of small programmes is far from a global solution. China and India are trying to expand mental health care in rural areas, but it will be a long time coming. More than a decade after the articles that changed the debate on global mental health, there has been no real growth in access to treatment, in poor countries’ spending on mental health care, or in mental health care funding from wealthy countries. There is one place, however, where mental health care has become a routine part of medical care, and that is Harare, Zimbabwe. The nation that proved to Patel that depression was universal has come up with a form of psychotherapy accessible to all – one that is effective, easy to duplicate and cheap. When Patel taught psychiatry at Harare Central hospital in the early 1990s, Dixon Chibanda was one of his students. After graduation, the other five psychiatry students in Chibanda’s class all left Zimbabwe for richer countries. Chibanda stayed. He treated private patients to make money, but also worked in the psychiatric hospital, where much of his work consisted of prescribing medicine and trying to make sure people took it. “I got into psychiatry to connect with people and nurture the human spirit,” he told me. “But I was beginning to feel increasingly disconnected from the people I was trying to help.” One night in 2005, Chibanda got a call from a doctor in Mutare, a city south-east of Harare. One of Chibanda’s former patients, a 24-year-old named Erica, had tried to kill herself with rat poison. Chibanda asked the doctor to tell Erica’s mother to bring her to see him as soon as possible. He heard nothing for three weeks, then one day the mother called to tell him that Erica had hanged herself from a mango tree in the family garden. “Why didn’t you bring her to see me as we planned?” Chibanda asked. “We didn’t have bus fare,” the mother said. “I started to realise that psychiatry in an institution is not the way to go,” Chibanda recalled. “We have to take it to the community.” He conducted a survey in 12 clinics around Harare, and found that the clinic with the highest rate of depression was in the slum of Mbare, where one in three people was affected. In 2006, he told the city health department he wanted to start a mental health programme there. Neither the department nor the clinic staff were enthusiastic. “The clinic told me the nurses were too busy,” Chibanda said. “And there was no space for me to work inside the building.” So he set up a bench in the yard. Grudgingly, the clinic lent Chibanda the services of its “Grannies” – middle-aged or older women with little education, who earn a small stipend doing community health work. The Grannies were given two weeks to learn what depression is, how to diagnose it using a simple questionnaire adapted for Zimbabwe by Patel, and how to do a form of problem-solving therapy modelled on an approach Abas had used in Harare in the early 90s. To be able to treat large numbers of depressed or anxious people, any solution has to be cheap and easy to spread. It can’t depend on having an office or trained professionals. The goal, said Abas, was to teach people who are already working with the community how to treat depression. Grannies on a bench turned out to be perfect. By 2015, every health clinic in Harare had a group of sturdy red wood benches in its yard, known as friendship benches, and grannies in brown uniforms who sat on them talking to patients each morning. The grannies use standard problem-solving therapy, but put it into terms people can relate to. They use Shona phrases for opening up the mind and strengthening the spirit. If patients want to pray with their granny, they pray. “We try to avoid dismissing what people believe in,” Chibanda said. “We say, pray, but in a way that encourages problem-solving: ‘God, help this person to identify which problem to focus on.’” Israel Makwara, Harare’s chief health promotion officer, told me that the grannies made every other health programme in Harare go better. The clinics’ HIV programmes were one example. “If somebody’s frame of mind is now solid, they are likely to adhere to their medications,” Makwara said. “They’ll do a whole lot better than someone who has given up the will to live.” At the Hatcliffe Polyclinic, in the north of Harare, very few people come to the clinic for mental health care, but the protocol is to offer everyone a questionnaire to screen them for depression. If they score high, they get an appointment on the friendship bench in the front yard. In Zimbabwe, elders are used to simply dispensing advice, said Vongai Muchengeti, a granny at the Hatcliffe clinic. But encouraging patients to come up with their own solutions is an important part of the therapy; it teaches patients to think more critically, assess alternatives and gain confidence. “How do you think you can resolve this?” Muchengeti kept asking one patient. “I’ve come here for you to tell me how,” the patient replied. “You’re supposed to help me.” “This is how I’m helping you,” Muchengeti said. The ideas the patients do come up with – I could look for work, I could talk to my husband – might seem obvious, but they’re not to people with depression. “You have HIV, your teenage daughter is pregnant, your husband is abusive, you’re about to be evicted,” said Ruth Verhey, a German-born clinical psychologist who runs the programme with Chibanda. “That buildup leads to a sense of helplessness.” The grannies help people overcome that. At the end of 2016, Chibanda published the results of a randomised control study in which he assigned 573 patients either to a bench or to a better version of usual care, including antidepressants when necessary. After six months, 50% of patients in the non-bench group were still depressed, while only 14% of friendship bench patients were. Today, Zimbabwe has friendship benches at 72 health clinics in three cities. Verhey estimated that about 40,000 patients have been treated in the last two or three years, most of them women. Chibanda has also launched benches in rural areas, and one for adolescents, which will be staffed by their peers. The model is also being adapted in other places, from Malawi and Zanzibar to New York. Verhey said people write from all over the world. “We get so many people saying: ‘I want to do this with my NGO, with my church group,’” she said. “My standard reply is that we like to work inside the health system. That way you have accessibility and sustainability.” For all its profile, however, the programme has next to no money. Neither Chibanda nor Verhey are paid. The programme has funding for specific research projects – including, recently, a much-needed study of how grannies were actually delivering therapy. But there are no funds to spread the programme. * * * Even before the friendship bench programme was fully underway, Chibanda knew it also had to offer some solutions to patients’ most important problem: desperate poverty. He consulted an expert on how women in slums or villages could make money: his own grandmother, who lived in Mbare, where the programme began. She said many women make money by crocheting sleeping mats – could they crochet other things? Verhey began collecting plastic destined for landfills, such as grocery bags and old videotapes, that could be shredded or unspooled and turned into yarn. Women visiting the benches used the yarn to crochet bags, purses, laptop cases and other items. They then sold the bags in local markets, while Verhey sold some in Zimbabwe’s high-end tourists shops and to other parents at Harare’s international school. A bag could sell for as much as $10 – more than three times the average daily income in Zimbabwe. The crocheting project had a second purpose: treatment on the bench usually lasts for about six sessions. But the need for solidarity and companionship does not go away. Meeting to turn in their bags and get new materials gave women a reason to congregate. The programme created a support system for the women, called Circle Kubatana Tose, which means “hold hands together”. There was a circle in nearly every clinic. I went to one circle in a small red building on the campus of the psychiatric unit at Harare Central hospital. Women came in with their latest crochet work and there was soon a heap of brightly coloured bags on the floor. They prayed, drummed, sang and shared their news. Their problems – domestic violence, alcoholic partners, HIV, hunger – were common in their neighbourhoods. But because of stigma, they were rarely discussed outside the circle. Neighbourhood life can be supportive and warm, rich with human connection. But it can also be dominated by gossip and judgment. A woman named Tackla told me that when she was diagnosed with HIV, she was desperate to talk about it. “But I was frightened to talk to people because they might laugh at me,” she said. “And if you talk to a neighbour, they could tell everybody. So I kept it to myself.” The circle was the only place she could talk freely, she said. In her circle, she was the first to volunteer that she was infected. “When I did, another woman said she was, too. We talk to each other,” she said. “We are friends.” The collapse of Zimbabwe’s economy is accelerating, and Verhey’s bag programme collapsed a year ago for lack of buyers. But the circles refused to fail. Women still gather at their health clinic or village well and sit and talk in a group they trust, and while they talk, they still crochet, or make shoes from rubber tyres. Vikram Patel had gone to Zimbabwe in 1993 seeking to show that depression was a social and political condition, and that no clinical intervention was necessary. He convinced himself of the opposite: psychotherapy or medicine were all that was needed to cure it. Now he has come halfway back around: you need both. About 80% of depressed people everywhere, Patel said, need only what he called a “hope intervention” – someone to guide them through self-help. That could be as little as a single session of counselling with a lay health worker. But it is also necessary to sit and talk to trusted friends in a circle. It is necessary to take a crochet hook and fashion old videotape into something that can allow you to feed your children. “We have to redefine what is a psychological intervention, recognising that for many people, their psychological well-being is embedded in their social world,” Patel said. “It would be almost unreal for a psychological worker in India to say to a woman whose husband beats her: ‘That is not my concern. I’m only concerned with your negative thoughts.’” • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",Depression; Mental health; Psychiatry; Health; Society; Poverty; Social exclusion; Zimbabwe; Africa; World news; India; Counselling and therapy,Society
2018-06-20T06:15:33Z,Welcome to Brumbria: should the West Midlands become a national park?,https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jun/20/welcome-to-brumbria-should-the-west-midlands-become-a-national-park,"“I think we have an extraordinary landscape here waiting to be discovered by millions,” says landscape architect Kathryn Moore, unrolling a jauntily coloured map of her visionary new park in a Birmingham City University office. The professor isn’t talking about of Cumbria, Umbria, Snowdonia or Amazonia. She’s talking about the touristic potential of the West Midlands plateau, the heart of England that threw itself into the fiery crucible of the Industrial Revolution and still bears sacrificial scars. It is here that Professor Moore wants to create the United Kingdom’s 16th national park. In the 19th century, Queen Victoria would lower the blinds on the royal train so she didn’t have to see the smokestack hell of the Black Country. Tolkien was inspired to create Mordor from nocturnal visions of its blast furnaces. If Moore has her way, though, in a decade or so Queen Kate will raise the blinds as the HS2 train passes the reconfigured Tame Valley between Birmingham and Coventry. “Look!” she’ll exclaim to King William. “What a vista of allotments, fisheries, fields, orchards, forests, hi-tech agriculture, green industries, creative hubs and cycle paths!” She’ll gaze in admiration at how the Tame has been rerouted using water from Birmingham city centre’s aquifer, all crisscrossed by new footbridges linking together suburbs long isolated by the city’s motorised arterial routes. And finally, as the train makes its approach to Philip Hardwick’s recently reopened grade I-listed, Roman-inspired, 1838 Curzon Street rail terminus, King William too will look out of the window. “Gosh!” he’ll exclaim. “Is that the famous Birmingham Central Park?” I know what you’re thinking. Make the Black Country green? Royal trains that stop in Birmingham? Understandably, Moore is steeling herself for the derision she’s going to get for daring to suggest the West Midlands might become green and pleasant. “Everybody talks about how this landscape is ugly or whatever,” she says. “But we can give it a new identity, and in so doing reimagine what it is to live in cities in a way that lives up to UN sustainable development goals.” Not since Mayor Joseph Chamberlain sought to make Birmingham the new Athens at the end of the 19th century has anyone round here dared to dream this big. On Thursday, Moore will unveil her plans for a new national park for the West Midlands at a conference in Birmingham. Last month, environment secretary Michael Gove asked if there is scope to expand the current network of national parks. Moore’s plans are a response to Gove’s invitation for ideas: a new vision for what a national park could be. Forget about trying to find new forests, coastlines or ancient wildernesses, Moore suggests: let’s re-green the West Midlands instead. “Birmingham was once famous as the city of a thousand trades,” she says. “Imagine if it became famous as the city of a thousand cycle and footpaths, a thousand parks and a thousand lakes.” Maybe she’s imagining a West Midlands akin to the post-apocalyptic England imagined in nature writer Richard Jefferies 19th-century novel After London, in which cities revert to nature – and the few survivors to a quasi-medieval way of life? “Not at all!” protests Moore. “I love cities, but I want to give them a better 21st century identity so they’re better to live in, more productive as well as more attractive.” Consider, for example, what’s wrong with suburban lawns. “If you look at wartime maps or aerial photos you’ll see that the landscape was used in a very different way. I want to bring back agriculture to the West Midlands, in part to increase food security. I want to create a new connection between the communities and the countryside people here haven’t experienced for decades.” Among the conference speakers will be James Corner, the landscape architect who changed perceptions of what cities could be like when he created a linear park from an abandoned elevated railway line in inner New York City and called it the High Line. Moore wants to do something similar, but with a twist. Instead of repurposing an abandoned railway, she plans to use a new one – the HS2 from London to Birmingham – as a catalyst. “It’s had so much bad publicity, but now we want to use the arrival of HS2 to create a better, greener West Midlands.” Moore serves on HS2’s design panel and hopes just as Birmingham led the world with the industrial revolution, it will lead the world in reimagining how an urban landscape can be married to a new notion of the countryside: a post-industrial revolution. Her proposal also aims to capitalise on Coventry becoming UK city of culture in 2021, and Birmingham hosting the Commonwealth Games in 2022. “The point is to harness all that energy to create something lasting that improves the quality of life of people here.” East London’s award-winning Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park was part of the legacy of the 2012 Olympics, and in that sense was something of a precursor for what she wants to achieve here. “The park would focus on encouraging active healthy lives and and wellbeing.” Moore’s national park proposal blames traditional development practices for long-term social, economic and environmental damage. Birmingham in particular and the West Midlands in general have long been considered proof of such blindness. Herbert Manzoni, Birmingham’s city engineer and surveyor, was in the 1960s and 70s what Baron Haussmann was to Paris a century before, building arterial routes and ring roads no matter what the cost to communities or aesthetics. The city became known for its underpasses filled with bad smells and worse buskers, while above traffic often as not sat in rush-hour gridlock. Manzoni created roads for drivers to sit in their private little boxes but neglected public spaces where you might want to walk or sit without having to cough up for a coffee. Moore’s proposals for a national park are an elegant counter to that car-based, free-market, environment-despoiling ideology. The worst aspect of what Manzoni did to the heart of England, Moore thinks, is that his roads carved up poorer neighbourhoods and made them more deprived as a result. “If you look at the map of multiple deprivation in the West Midlands,” she explains, “you’ll see how deprived communities are often ringed by roads that are hard to cross. They can’t get out of their neighbourhoods very easily to get to work or to education. The roads that were meant to connect people actually serve to leave some behind.” She has a point. Before meeting Moore, I get the 67 bus along the Tyburn and and Lichfield Roads, a route which goes through some of east Birmingham’s most deprived areas. Sue, a nurse heading home to Pype Hayes after her shift tells me she thinks estates like hers have been neglected by planners for too long. “Castle Vale and Chelmsley Wood, and lots of other estates in the West Midlands are cut off from the rest off the city by the M6 and by the big main roads. They become ghettoes. Your professor’s dead right about that and something needs to be done.” But she’s sceptical about plans for a national park. “People have always had big ideas for how to improve Birmingham,” she says. Fair point: I remember interviewing Birmingham council leader Mike Whitby in 2010 when he told me he thought the new central library might be better known as “a palazzo of human thought”. “But they always come unstuck when it comes to money,” says Sue. Again, fair point: that glamorous new library’s opening hours have been reduced because of council cuts. Potential sources of funding for Moore’s national park include the Department for Transport, the Environment Agency, Natural England, the Canal and River Trust and the Maria Nobrega Foundation. Later I ask a group of criminology students picnicking outside Birmingham’s Thinktank science museum if they like the idea of a Central Park over the wastelands they can glimpse from their flats. “I’d certainly like to stay here if it was a little less harsh and had more public parks,” says one. “I can imagine making a good life in this city if it wasn’t just for people with cars and lots of money,” says another. “I like the idea of having a national park on your doorstep and I suspect it would increase tourism.” What should it be called? “Heartlandia,” suggests one. “Mordor 2.0,” offers another. I’d like to see it called Brumbria, and picture tourists wondering why this looks nothing like Assisi or Keswick. Back in Birmingham City University, Moore explains that a tourism bump is certainly part of her agenda, but so is developing new skills in sectors that the West Midlands has hardly been known for in recent years – such as agriculture, horticulture, food production. “The park would boost the economy because it would make it more attractive for people to want to live here and that would make it more attractive for business.” No wonder, perhaps, that support for her project comes from Andy Street, former head of John Lewis and now the West Midlands’ first elected mayor, as well as Meriden MP Dame Caroline Spelman – the latter in part wooed by Moore’s idea that the Forest of Arden should be extended as part of the project. But Moore admits to dodging the question when I ask her if planners for the West Midlands are all behind her scheme. Perhaps just as importantly, Moore is hoping to reveal the West Midlands’ forgotten identity to its nearly three million inhabitants. To emphasise the point, she shows me two more maps. One is an recent Ordnance Survey map of the county with multicoloured roads and grey built-up zones, the other a relief map from the mid-19th century. Her point is that today most West Midlands citizens map their native land through its roads, not through its natural landscape – its rivers in particular. Her Brummie husband, she tells me, did not know that his home city was built on a plateau, still less could he point out where the area’s many rivers – the Tame, Rae, Blythe and Stour among them – flow. Like everybody round here, he knows that Birmingham has more miles of canals than Venice and more trees than Paris, but that’s not the kind of landscape his wife has in mind. “The plans I’m creating involve inverting maps. Traditionally the maps of the region highlight roads and building infrastructure. The ones I’ve drawn up highlight the contours of the landscape, the rivers and the green parts. I want to make people here proud of where they’re from. Not just because of the industrial heritage but because of the landscape that made that industry possible.” I look out of the window from Moore’s office, past the railway tracks, terraced roofs, abandoned factories and run-down pubs, wondering if in my lifetime the West Midlands National Park will join the Yorkshire Dales, the Pembrokeshire Coast, the Lake District and the Cairngorms as one of the precious, beautiful parts of Britain. “It’s all about changing perceptions,” says Moore.

2018-01-29T07:00:41Z,NHS admits doctors may be using tools made by children in Pakistan,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jan/29/nhs-admits-doctors-may-be-using-tools-made-by-children-in-pakistan,"Children as young as 12 are making surgical instruments in hazardous conditions in Pakistan, prompting fears that the tools could be used in the NHS, the Guardian has discovered. In Sialkot, Punjab, where 99% of Pakistan’s surgical instrument production is centred, illegal child labour was witnessed in at least a dozen small workshops. Boys are paid less than $1 (70p) a day to cut, drill, bend and polish steel pieces into gleaming surgical tools for export. Inside the cramped workshops, metal dust is everywhere and the noise of the grinders, polishers and generators is deafening. But there is no sign of protective goggles, earphones, masks or other safety equipment. Three companies that export to the UK said they buy instruments from these workshops. The evidence has ignited fears in Britain that tools used routinely in NHS operating theatres and consulting rooms are made with child labour. NHS Supply Chain, among the largest suppliers to the NHS, bans child labour from its “first tier” suppliers, most of whom are based in the UK. However, it admitted it does not know which manufacturers are used in Pakistan. Doctors, politicians and a labour rights group, the Ethical Trading Initiative, say more must be done to ensure child labour is not found in the NHS supply chain. Dr Mahmood Bhutta, an NHS surgeon and founder of the British Medical Association’s (BMA) Medical Fair and Ethical Trade Group, said: “For many of the instruments I use, I have no reliable way of ensuring they have not been made by children.” Britain is the third largest buyer of surgical instruments from Pakistan, accounting for 10% of the country’s total exports. In all, 80%-90% of surgical instruments are manufactured in the country, according to NHS Supply Chain. Bhutta said that while pay and conditions have improved in some larger factories since the BMA first investigated the issue in 2008, serious worries remain. “We still don’t know where most surgical instruments coming into the NHS are made. But we do know a lot of them will have come from Pakistan. I would be amazed if at least some of the instruments used in the NHS weren’t made in these small workshops.” The protection of workers’ rights, as well as more transparency, should be written into the NHS constitution, Bhutta said. Cindy Berman, head of modern slavery strategy at the Ethical Trading Initiative, said: “NHS budgets are tight, but savings mustn’t come at the expense of human rights. “We know child labour exists in the surgical instrument sector in Pakistan, often in the initial stages of production, and it’s likely that some of these instruments will end up here in the UK. While NHS Supply Chain has taken important first steps in tackling these abuses, more can and should be done.” She said child labour flourishes when adult workers cannot afford to feed, house and clothe their families, which is why public bodies like the NHS need to make sure they are paying fair prices and sourcing ethical suppliers. The Pakistan export market in surgical tools is worth $358m (£255m), a tiny slice of a lucrative global market worth $17bn. Most of it is based in Sialkot, but local manufacturers receive only a small portion of the revenue, while outsourcing importers make the largest profits. Iram Zafar, secretary general of the Surgical Instruments Manufacturers Association of Pakistan (Simap), said the sector had produced and exported more than 15,000 pieces to the UK between July and December last year, worth $11.4m. According to Simap, 3,600 factories produce 150 million instruments a year. Labour forces vary from 15 to 450 people. Pakistan has signed up to the UN’s sustainable development goals, which call for an end to child labour by 2025. Punjab laws ban under 18s from working in “hazardous industries”, and children under 14 from working at all. But child labour is common in a country where poverty is endemic, compliance with labour laws weak, unions scarce and profit margins low. While no official survey has been carried out in Pakistan since 1996, the underage workforce is estimated at between 5.7 and 12.5 million. The ETI suggests the incidence of child labour is high, against a declining trend globally. Zain, 12, who began work in one of Sialkot’s surgical instrument shops eight months ago after his father died, works eight hours a day, six days a week to bring home $25 a month. “I know it’s dangerous, but I have to pay some debts and support my family,” he said. At busy times, he can work as many as 12 hours a day. At night, the children often suffer from dry coughs, asthma and other respiratory problems. His colleague Azwar got a job in a small workshop more than a year ago, when he was 12. “I have to support my parents and siblings to make ends meet,” he said. The workshop’s owner, who declined to be named, said his business had never been inspected by the Punjab Labour Department in 25 years. He acts as a sub-contractor for the city’s larger factories, but refused to provide names. The sub-contracting, combined with the complexity and lack of transparency of the supply chain, makes it difficult to trace the surgical instruments from forge to operating theatre.NHS Supply Chain is not subject to the same transparency requirements of private companies under the Modern Slavery Act, something that campaigners, including the ETI, are keen to change. Lola Young, Baroness of Hornsey, has proposed a private member’s bill to promote transparency across supply chains of British companies and public bodies, by requiring them to provide a statement on slavery and trafficking in their annual reports and accounts. “If including child labour is in your business model, you have to change your business model,” said Young, who has been involved in supply chain analysis in the fashion industry. NHS Supply Chain said it does not know which manufacturers its suppliers use in Pakistan. Neither does it require its suppliers to audit their Pakistani suppliers, although it said that some do. The Guardian wrote to 22 of NHS Supply Chain’s “first tier” suppliers asking if they source instruments from Sialkot. Only six replied, one of which said it did not supply to the NHS. Two confirmed they did source instruments from Sialkot and three said they did not. NHS Supply Chain confirmed 11 of its suppliers source from Pakistan, but declined to give company names. A spokeswoman said NHS Supply Chain was committed to working with suppliers serious about managing labour standard issues in their supply chains, but accepted more needed to be done. She said: “We are aware of the potential for labour standards abuses to occur within supply chains [for] surgical instruments, which is why we have taken steps to increase requirements for supplier due diligence in our contracts and worked … to develop guidance and systems to address these issues. “We believe that the supplier code of conduct, the LSAS [Labour Standards Assurance System] approach and the guidance and advice that we have provided to our suppliers has been effective in shining a light on the issue across the industry, however, we are not complacent and we recognise that it will require continued effort and vigilance across the sector to raise and maintain standards uniformly.” The LSAS was introduced in 2012, requiring first tier suppliers to map their supply chain and assess labour abuse risks.",Employment; Global development; Transparency; Pakistan; South and central Asia; World news; Child labour; NHS; Health; Society; Sustainable development goals,Global development
2018-09-16T15:26:00Z,"The EU needs a stability and wellbeing pact, not more growth",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/16/the-eu-needs-a-stability-and-wellbeing-pact-not-more-growth,"This week, scientists, politicians, and policymakers are gathering in Brussels for a landmark conference. The aim of this event, organised by members of the European parliament from five different political groups, alongside trade unions and NGOs, is to explore possibilities for a “post-growth economy” in Europe. For the past seven decades, GDP growth has stood as the primary economic objective of European nations. But as our economies have grown, so has our negative impact on the environment. We are now exceeding the safe operating space for humanity on this planet, and there is no sign that economic activity is being decoupled from resource use or pollution at anything like the scale required. Today, solving social problems within European nations does not require more growth. It requires a fairer distribution of the income and wealth that we already have. Growth is also becoming harder to achieve due to declining productivity gains, market saturation, and ecological degradation. If current trends continue, there may be no growth at all in Europe within a decade. Right now the response is to try to fuel growth by issuing more debt, shredding environmental regulations, extending working hours, and cutting social protections. This aggressive pursuit of growth at all costs divides society, creates economic instability, and undermines democracy. Those in power have not been willing to engage with these issues, at least not until now. The European commission’s Beyond GDP project became GDP and Beyond. The official mantra remains growth — redressed as “sustainable”, “green”, or “inclusive” – but first and foremost, growth. Even the new UN sustainable development goals include the pursuit of economic growth as a policy goal for all countries, despite the fundamental contradiction between growth and sustainability. The good news is that within civil society and academia, a post-growth movement has been emerging. It goes by different names in different places: décroissance, Postwachstum, steady-state or doughnut economics, prosperity without growth, to name a few. Since 2008, regular degrowth conferences have gathered thousands of participants. A new global initiative, the Wellbeing Economies Alliance (or WE-All), is making connections between these movements, while a European research network has been developing new “ecological macroeconomic models”. Such work suggests that it’s possible to improve quality of life, restore the living world, reduce inequality, and provide meaningful jobs – all without the need for economic growth, provided we enact policies to overcome our current growth dependence. Some of the changes that have been proposed include limits on resource use, progressive taxation to stem the tide of rising inequality, and a gradual reduction in working time. Resource use could be curbed by introducing a carbon tax, and the revenue could be returned as a dividend for everyone or used to finance social programmes. Introducing both a basic and a maximum income would reduce inequality further, while helping to redistribute care work and reducing the power imbalances that undermine democracy. New technologies could be used to reduce working time and improve quality of life, instead of being used to lay off masses of workers and increase the profits of the privileged few. Given the risks at stake, it would be irresponsible for politicians and policymakers not to explore possibilities for a post-growth future. The conference happening in Brussels is a promising start, but much stronger commitments are needed. As a group of concerned social and natural scientists representing all Europe, we call on the European Union, its institutions, and member states to: 1. Constitute a special commission on post-growth futures in the EU parliament. This commission should actively debate the future of growth, devise policy alternatives for post-growth futures, and reconsider the pursuit of growth as an overarching policy goal. 2. Incorporate alternative indicators into the macroeconomic framework of the EU and its member states. Economic policies should be evaluated in terms of their impact on human wellbeing, resource use, inequality, and the provision of decent work. These indicators should be given higher priority than GDP in decision-making. 3. Turn the stability and growth pact (SGP) into a stability and wellbeing pact. The SGP is a set of rules aimed at limiting government deficits and national debt. It should be revised to ensure member states meet the basic needs of their citizens, while reducing resource use and waste emissions to a sustainable level. 4. Establish a ministry for economic transition in each member state. A new economy that focuses directly on human and ecological wellbeing could offer a much better future than one that is structurally dependent on economic growth.

2018-07-18T00:41:58Z,Barack Obama's Johannesburg speech in full,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/18/barack-obamas-johannesburg-speech-in-full,"As he delivered the Nelson Mandela annual lecture on Tuesday night in Johannesburg, Barack Obama delivered a strong rebuke to Donald Trump, without once naming the sitting president. Speaking in front of a crowd of 15,000 people, Obama warned that “the politics of fear, resentment, retrenchment” are on the move “at a pace unimaginable just a few years ago”, in what has been dubbed his most important speech since leaving office. The full text of the speech, released by the office of Barack Obama, is below: Thank you. To Mama Graça Machel, members of the Mandela family, the Machel family, to President Ramaphosa who you can see is inspiring new hope in this great country – professor, doctor, distinguished guests, to Mama Sisulu and the Sisulu family, to the people of South Africa – it is a singular honor for me to be here with all of you as we gather to celebrate the birth and life of one of history’s true giants. Let me begin by a correction and a few confessions. The correction is that I am a very good dancer. I just want to be clear about that. Michelle is a little better. The confessions. Number one, I was not exactly invited to be here. I was ordered in a very nice way to be here by Graça Machel. Confession number two: I forgot my geography and the fact that right now it’s winter in South Africa. I didn’t bring a coat, and this morning I had to send somebody out to the mall because I am wearing long johns. I was born in Hawaii. Confession number three: When my staff told me that I was to deliver a lecture, I thought back to the stuffy old professors in bow ties and tweed, and I wondered if this was one more sign of the stage of life that I’m entering, along with grey hair and slightly failing eyesight. I thought about the fact that my daughters think anything I tell them is a lecture. I thought about the American press and how they often got frustrated at my long-winded answers at press conferences, when my responses didn’t conform to two-minute soundbites. But given the strange and uncertain times that we are in – and they are strange, and they are uncertain – with each day’s news cycles bringing more head-spinning and disturbing headlines, I thought maybe it would be useful to step back for a moment and try to get some perspective. So I hope you’ll indulge me, despite the slight chill, as I spend much of this lecture reflecting on where we’ve been, and how we arrived at this present moment, in the hope that it will offer us a roadmap for where we need to go next. One hundred years ago, Madiba was born in the village of M – oh, see there, I always get that – I got to get my Ms right when I’m in South Africa. Mvezo – I got it. Truthfully, it’s because it’s so cold, my lips stuck. So in his autobiography he describes a happy childhood; he’s looking after cattle, he’s playing with the other boys, eventually attends a school where his teacher gave him the English name Nelson. And as many of you know, he’s quoted saying, ‘Why she bestowed this particular name upon me, I have no idea.’ There was no reason to believe that a young black boy at this time, in this place, could in any way alter history. After all, South Africa was then less than a decade removed from full British control. Already, laws were being codified to implement racial segregation and subjugation, the network of laws that would be known as apartheid. Most of Africa, including my father’s homeland, was under colonial rule. The dominant European powers, having ended a horrific world war just a few months after Madiba’s birth, viewed this continent and its people primarily as spoils in a contest for territory and abundant natural resources and cheap labor. And the inferiority of the black race, an indifference towards black culture and interests and aspirations, was a given. And such a view of the world – that certain races, certain nations, certain groups were inherently superior, and that violence and coercion is the primary basis for governance, that the strong necessarily exploit the weak, that wealth is determined primarily by conquest – that view of the world was hardly confined to relations between Europe and Africa, or relations between whites and blacks. Whites were happy to exploit other whites when they could. And by the way, blacks were often willing to exploit other blacks. And around the globe, the majority of people lived at subsistence levels, without a say in the politics or economic forces that determined their lives. Often they were subject to the whims and cruelties of distant leaders. The average person saw no possibility of advancing from the circumstances of their birth. Women were almost uniformly subordinate to men. Privilege and status was rigidly bound by caste and colour and ethnicity and religion. And even in my own country, even in democracies like the United States, founded on a declaration that all men are created equal, racial segregation and systemic discrimination was the law in almost half the country and the norm throughout the rest of the country. That was the world just 100 years ago. There are people alive today who were alive in that world. It is hard, then, to overstate the remarkable transformations that have taken place since that time. A second world war, even more terrible than the first, along with a cascade of liberation movements from Africa to Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, would finally bring an end to colonial rule. More and more peoples, having witnessed the horrors of totalitarianism, the repeated mass slaughters of the 20th century, began to embrace a new vision for humanity, a new idea, one based not only on the principle of national self-determination, but also on the principles of democracy and rule of law and civil rights and the inherent dignity of every single individual. In those nations with market-based economies, suddenly union movements developed; and health and safety and commercial regulations were instituted; and access to public education was expanded; and social welfare systems emerged, all with the aim of constraining the excesses of capitalism and enhancing its ability to provide opportunity not just to some but to all people. And the result was unmatched economic growth and a growth of the middle class. And in my own country, the moral force of the civil rights movement not only overthrew Jim Crow laws but it opened up the floodgates for women and historically marginalised groups to reimagine themselves, to find their own voices, to make their own claims to full citizenship. It was in service of this long walk towards freedom and justice and equal opportunity that Nelson Mandela devoted his life. At the outset, his struggle was particular to this place, to his homeland – a fight to end apartheid, a fight to ensure lasting political and social and economic equality for its disenfranchised non-white citizens. But through his sacrifice and unwavering leadership and, perhaps most of all, through his moral example, Mandela and the movement he led would come to signify something larger. He came to embody the universal aspirations of dispossessed people all around the world, their hopes for a better life, the possibility of a moral transformation in the conduct of human affairs. Madiba’s light shone so brightly, even from that narrow Robben Island cell, that in the late ‘70s he could inspire a young college student on the other side of the world to reexamine his own priorities, could make me consider the small role I might play in bending the arc of the world towards justice. And when later, as a law student, I witnessed Madiba emerge from prison, just a few months, you’ll recall, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, I felt the same wave of hope that washed through hearts all around the world. Do you remember that feeling? It seemed as if the forces of progress were on the march, that they were inexorable. Each step he took, you felt this is the moment when the old structures of violence and repression and ancient hatreds that had so long stunted people’s lives and confined the human spirit – that all that was crumbling before our eyes. And then as Madiba guided this nation through negotiation painstakingly, reconciliation, its first fair and free elections; as we all witnessed the grace and the generosity with which he embraced former enemies, the wisdom for him to step away from power once he felt his job was complete, we understood that – we understood it was not just the subjugated, the oppressed who were being freed from the shackles of the past. The subjugator was being offered a gift, being given a chance to see in a new way, being given a chance to participate in the work of building a better world. And during the last decades of the 20th century, the progressive, democratic vision that Nelson Mandela represented in many ways set the terms of international political debate. It doesn’t mean that vision was always victorious, but it set the terms, the parameters; it guided how we thought about the meaning of progress, and it continued to propel the world forward. Yes, there were still tragedies – bloody civil wars from the Balkans to the Congo. Despite the fact that ethnic and sectarian strife still flared up with heartbreaking regularity, despite all that as a consequence of the continuation of nuclear détente, and a peaceful and prosperous Japan, and a unified Europe anchored in NATO, and the entry of China into the world’s system of trade – all that greatly reduced the prospect of war between the world’s great powers. And from Europe to Africa, Latin America, southeast Asia, dictatorships began to give way to democracies. The march was on. A respect for human rights and the rule of law, enumerated in a declaration by the United Nations, became the guiding norm for the majority of nations, even in places where the reality fell far short of the ideal. Even when those human rights were violated, those who violated human rights were on the defensive. And with these geopolitical changes came sweeping economic changes. The introduction of market-based principles, in which previously closed economies along with the forces of global integration powered by new technologies, suddenly unleashed entrepreneurial talents to those that once had been relegated to the periphery of the world economy, who hadn’t counted. Suddenly they counted. They had some power; they had the possibilities of doing business. And then came scientific breakthroughs and new infrastructure and the reduction of armed conflicts. And suddenly a billion people were lifted out of poverty, and once-starving nations were able to feed themselves, and infant mortality rates plummeted. And meanwhile, the spread of the internet made it possible for people to connect across oceans, and cultures and continents instantly were brought together, and potentially, all the world’s knowledge could be in the hands of a small child in even the most remote village. That’s what happened just over the course of a few decades. And all that progress is real. It has been broad, and it has been deep, and it all happened in what – by the standards of human history – was nothing more than a blink of an eye. And now an entire generation has grown up in a world that by most measures has gotten steadily freer and healthier and wealthier and less violent and more tolerant during the course of their lifetimes. It should make us hopeful. But if we cannot deny the very real strides that our world has made since that moment when Madiba took those steps out of confinement, we also have to recognise all the ways that the international order has fallen short of its promise. In fact, it is in part because of the failures of governments and powerful elites to squarely address the shortcomings and contradictions of this international order that we now see much of the world threatening to return to an older, a more dangerous, a more brutal way of doing business. So we have to start by admitting that whatever laws may have existed on the books, whatever wonderful pronouncements existed in constitutions, whatever nice words were spoken during these last several decades at international conferences or in the halls of the United Nations, the previous structures of privilege and power and injustice and exploitation never completely went away. They were never fully dislodged. Caste differences still impact the life chances of people on the Indian subcontinent. Ethnic and religious differences still determine who gets opportunity from the Central Europe to the Gulf. It is a plain fact that racial discrimination still exists in both the United States and South Africa. And it is also a fact that the accumulated disadvantages of years of institutionalised oppression have created yawning disparities in income, and in wealth, and in education, and in health, in personal safety, in access to credit. Women and girls around the world continue to be blocked from positions of power and authority. They continue to be prevented from getting a basic education. They are disproportionately victimised by violence and abuse. They’re still paid less than men for doing the same work. That’s still happening. Economic opportunity, for all the magnificence of the global economy, all the shining skyscrapers that have transformed the landscape around the world, entire neighbourhoods, entire cities, entire regions, entire nations have been bypassed. In other words, for far too many people, the more things have changed, the more things stayed the same. And while globalisation and technology have opened up new opportunities, have driven remarkable economic growth in previously struggling parts of the world, globalisation has also upended the agricultural and manufacturing sectors in many countries. It’s also greatly reduced the demand for certain workers, has helped weaken unions and labor’s bargaining power. It’s made it easier for capital to avoid tax laws and the regulations of nation-states – can just move billions, trillions of dollars with a tap of a computer key. And the result of all these trends has been an explosion in economic inequality. It’s meant that a few dozen individuals control the same amount of wealth as the poorest half of humanity. That’s not an exaggeration, that’s a statistic. Think about that. In many middle-income and developing countries, new wealth has just tracked the old bad deal that people got because it reinforced or even compounded existing patterns of inequality, the only difference is it created even greater opportunities for corruption on an epic scale. And for once solidly middle-class families in advanced economies like the United States, these trends have meant greater economic insecurity, especially for those who don’t have specialised skills, people who were in manufacturing, people working in factories, people working on farms. In every country just about, the disproportionate economic clout of those at the top has provided these individuals with wildly disproportionate influence on their countries’ political life and on its media; on what policies are pursued and whose interests end up being ignored. Now, it should be noted that this new international elite, the professional class that supports them, differs in important respects from the ruling aristocracies of old. It includes many who are self-made. It includes champions of meritocracy. And although still mostly white and male, as a group they reflect a diversity of nationalities and ethnicities that would have not existed a hundred years ago. A decent percentage consider themselves liberal in their politics, modern and cosmopolitan in their outlook. Unburdened by parochialism, or nationalism, or overt racial prejudice or strong religious sentiment, they are equally comfortable in New York or London or Shanghai or Nairobi or Buenos Aires, or Johannesburg. Many are sincere and effective in their philanthropy. Some of them count Nelson Mandela among their heroes. Some even supported Barack Obama for the presidency of the United States, and by virtue of my status as a former head of state, some of them consider me as an honorary member of the club. And I get invited to these fancy things, you know? They’ll fly me out. But what’s nevertheless true is that in their business dealings, many titans of industry and finance are increasingly detached from any single locale or nation-state, and they live lives more and more insulated from the struggles of ordinary people in their countries of origin. And their decisions – their decisions to shut down a manufacturing plant, or to try to minimise their tax bill by shifting profits to a tax haven with the help of high-priced accountants or lawyers, or their decision to take advantage of lower-cost immigrant labor, or their decision to pay a bribe – are often done without malice; it’s just a rational response, they consider, to the demands of their balance sheets and their shareholders and competitive pressures. But too often, these decisions are also made without reference to notions of human solidarity – or a ground-level understanding of the consequences that will be felt by particular people in particular communities by the decisions that are made. And from their board rooms or retreats, global decision-makers don’t get a chance to see sometimes the pain in the faces of laid-off workers. Their kids don’t suffer when cuts in public education and health care result as a consequence of a reduced tax base because of tax avoidance. They can’t hear the resentment of an older tradesman when he complains that a newcomer doesn’t speak his language on a job site where he once worked. They’re less subject to the discomfort and the displacement that some of their countrymen may feel as globalisation scrambles not only existing economic arrangements, but traditional social and religious mores. Which is why, at the end of the 20th century, while some Western commentators were declaring the end of history and the inevitable triumph of liberal democracy and the virtues of the global supply chain, so many missed signs of a brewing backlash – a backlash that arrived in so many forms. It announced itself most violently with 9/11 and the emergence of transnational terrorist networks, fuelled by an ideology that perverted one of the world’s great religions and asserted a struggle not just between Islam and the West but between Islam and modernity, and an ill-advised U.S. invasion of Iraq didn’t help, accelerating a sectarian conflict. Russia, already humiliated by its reduced influence since the collapse of the Soviet Union, feeling threatened by democratic movements along its borders, suddenly started reasserting authoritarian control and in some cases meddling with its neighbours. China, emboldened by its economic success, started bristling against criticism of its human rights record; it framed the promotion of universal values as nothing more than foreign meddling, imperialism under a new name. Within the United States, within the European Union, challenges to globalisation first came from the left but then came more forcefully from the right, as you started seeing populist movements – which, by the way, are often cynically funded by right-wing billionaires intent on reducing government constraints on their business interests – these movements tapped the unease that was felt by many people who lived outside of the urban cores; fears that economic security was slipping away, that their social status and privileges were eroding, that their cultural identities were being threatened by outsiders, somebody that didn’t look like them or sound like them or pray as they did. And perhaps more than anything else, the devastating impact of the 2008 financial crisis, in which the reckless behaviour of financial elites resulted in years of hardship for ordinary people all around the world, made all the previous assurances of experts ring hollow – all those assurances that somehow financial regulators knew what they were doing, that somebody was minding the store, that global economic integration was an unadulterated good. Because of the actions taken by governments during and after that crisis, including, I should add, by aggressive steps by my administration, the global economy has now returned to healthy growth. But the credibility of the international system, the faith in experts in places like Washington or Brussels, all that had taken a blow. And a politics of fear and resentment and retrenchment began to appear, and that kind of politics is now on the move. It’s on the move at a pace that would have seemed unimaginable just a few years ago. I am not being alarmist, I am simply stating the facts. Look around. Strongman politics are ascendant suddenly, whereby elections and some pretence of democracy are maintained – the form of it – but those in power seek to undermine every institution or norm that gives democracy meaning. In the West, you’ve got far-right parties that oftentimes are based not just on platforms of protectionism and closed borders, but also on barely hidden racial nationalism. Many developing countries now are looking at China’s model of authoritarian control combined with mercantilist capitalism as preferable to the messiness of democracy. Who needs free speech as long as the economy is going good? The free press is under attack. Censorship and state control of media is on the rise. Social media – once seen as a mechanism to promote knowledge and understanding and solidarity – has proved to be just as effective promoting hatred and paranoia and propaganda and conspiracy theories. So on Madiba’s 100th birthday, we now stand at a crossroads – a moment in time at which two very different visions of humanity’s future compete for the hearts and the minds of citizens around the world. Two different stories, two different narratives about who we are and who we should be. How should we respond? Should we see that wave of hope that we felt with Madiba’s release from prison, from the Berlin Wall coming down – should we see that hope that we had as naïve and misguided? Should we understand the last 25 years of global integration as nothing more than a detour from the previous inevitable cycle of history – where might makes right, and politics is a hostile competition between tribes and races and religions, and nations compete in a zero-sum game, constantly teetering on the edge of conflict until full-blown war breaks out? Is that what we think? Let me tell you what I believe. I believe in Nelson Mandela’s vision. I believe in a vision shared by Gandhi and King and Abraham Lincoln. I believe in a vision of equality and justice and freedom and multi-racial democracy, built on the premise that all people are created equal, and they’re endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights. And I believe that a world governed by such principles is possible and that it can achieve more peace and more cooperation in pursuit of a common good. That’s what I believe. And I believe we have no choice but to move forward; that those of us who believe in democracy and civil rights and a common humanity have a better story to tell. And I believe this not just based on sentiment, I believe it based on hard evidence. The fact that the world’s most prosperous and successful societies, the ones with the highest living standards and the highest levels of satisfaction among their people, happen to be those which have most closely approximated the liberal, progressive ideal that we talk about and have nurtured the talents and contributions of all their citizens. The fact that authoritarian governments have been shown time and time again to breed corruption, because they’re not accountable; to repress their people; to lose touch eventually with reality; to engage in bigger and bigger lies that ultimately result in economic and political and cultural and scientific stagnation. Look at history. Look at the facts. The fact that countries which rely on rabid nationalism and xenophobia and doctrines of tribal, racial or religious superiority as their main organizing principle, the thing that holds people together – eventually those countries find themselves consumed by civil war or external war. Check the history books. The fact that technology cannot be put back in a bottle, so we’re stuck with the fact that we now live close together and populations are going to be moving, and environmental challenges are not going to go away on their own, so that the only way to effectively address problems like climate change or mass migration or pandemic disease will be to develop systems for more international cooperation, not less. We have a better story to tell. But to say that our vision for the future is better is not to say that it will inevitably win. Because history also shows the power of fear. History shows the lasting hold of greed and the desire to dominate others in the minds of men. Especially men. History shows how easily people can be convinced to turn on those who look different, or worship God in a different way. So if we’re truly to continue Madiba’s long walk towards freedom, we’re going to have to work harder and we’re going to have to be smarter. We’re going to have to learn from the mistakes of the recent past. And so in the brief time remaining, let me just suggest a few guideposts for the road ahead, guideposts that draw from Madiba’s work, his words, the lessons of his life. First, Madiba shows those of us who believe in freedom and democracy we are going to have to fight harder to reduce inequality and promote lasting economic opportunity for all people. Now, I don’t believe in economic determinism. Human beings don’t live on bread alone. But they need bread. And history shows that societies which tolerate vast differences in wealth feed resentments and reduce solidarity and actually grow more slowly; and that once people achieve more than mere subsistence, then they’re measuring their well-being by how they compare to their neighbours, and whether their children can expect to live a better life. And when economic power is concentrated in the hands of the few, history also shows that political power is sure to follow – and that dynamic eats away at democracy. Sometimes it may be straight-out corruption, but sometimes it may not involve the exchange of money; it’s just folks who are that wealthy get what they want, and it undermines human freedom. And Madiba understood this. This is not new. He warned us about this. He said: “Where globalisation means, as it so often does, that the rich and the powerful now have new means to further enrich and empower themselves at the cost of the poorer and the weaker, [then] we have a responsibility to protest in the name of universal freedom.” That’s what he said. So if we are serious about universal freedom today, if we care about social justice today, then we have a responsibility to do something about it. And I would respectfully amend what Madiba said. I don’t do it often, but I’d say it’s not enough for us to protest; we’re going to have to build, we’re going to have to innovate, we’re going to have to figure out how do we close this widening chasm of wealth and opportunity both within countries and between them. And how we achieve this is going to vary country to country, and I know your new president is committed to rolling up his sleeves and trying to do so. But we can learn from the last 70 years that it will not involve unregulated, unbridled, unethical capitalism. It also won’t involve old-style command-and-control socialism from the top. That was tried; it didn’t work very well. For almost all countries, progress is going to depend on an inclusive market-based system – one that offers education for every child; that protects collective bargaining and secures the rights of every worker – that breaks up monopolies to encourage competition in small and medium-sized businesses; and has laws that root out corruption and ensures fair dealing in business; that maintains some form of progressive taxation so that rich people are still rich but they’re giving a little bit back to make sure that everybody else has something to pay for universal health care and retirement security, and invests in infrastructure and scientific research that builds platforms for innovation. I should add, by the way, right now I’m actually surprised by how much money I got, and let me tell you something: I don’t have half as much as most of these folks or a tenth or a hundredth. There’s only so much you can eat. There’s only so big a house you can have. There’s only so many nice trips you can take. I mean, it’s enough. You don’t have to take a vow of poverty just to say, “Well, let me help out and let a few of the other folks – let me look at that child out there who doesn’t have enough to eat or needs some school fees, let me help him out. I’ll pay a little more in taxes. It’s okay. I can afford it.” I mean, it shows a poverty of ambition to just want to take more and more and more, instead of saying, “Wow, I’ve got so much. Who can I help? How can I give more and more and more?” That’s ambition. That’s impact. That’s influence. What an amazing gift to be able to help people, not just yourself. Where was I? I ad-libbed. You get the point. It involves promoting an inclusive capitalism both within nations and between nations. And as we pursue, for example, the sustainable development goals, we have to get past the charity mindset. We’ve got to bring more resources to the forgotten pockets of the world through investment and entrepreneurship, because there is talent everywhere in the world if given an opportunity. When it comes to the international system of commerce and trade, it’s legitimate for poorer countries to continue to seek access to wealthier markets. And by the way, wealthier markets, that’s not the big problem that you’re having – that a small African country is sending you tea and flowers. That’s not your biggest economic challenge. It’s also proper for advanced economies like the United States to insist on reciprocity from nations like China that are no longer solely poor countries, to make sure that they’re providing access to their markets and that they stop taking intellectual property and hacking our servers. But even as there are discussions to be had around trade and commerce, it’s important to recognise this reality: while the outsourcing of jobs from north to south, from east to west, while a lot of that was a dominant trend in the late 20th century, the biggest challenge to workers in countries like mine today is technology. And the biggest challenge for your new president when we think about how we’re going to employ more people here is going to be also technology, because artificial intelligence is here and it is accelerating, and you’re going to have driverless cars, and you’re going to have more and more automated services, and that’s going to make the job of giving everybody work that is meaningful tougher, and we’re going to have to be more imaginative, and the pact of change is going to require us to do more fundamental reimagining of our social and political arrangements, to protect the economic security and the dignity that comes with a job. It’s not just money that a job provides; it provides dignity and structure and a sense of place and a sense of purpose. And so we’re going to have to consider new ways of thinking about these problems, like a universal income, review of our workweek, how we retrain our young people, how we make everybody an entrepreneur at some level. But we’re going to have to worry about economics if we want to get democracy back on track. Second, Madiba teaches us that some principles really are universal – and the most important one is the principle that we are bound together by a common humanity and that each individual has inherent dignity and worth. Now, it’s surprising that we have to affirm this truth today. More than a quarter century after Madiba walked out of prison, I still have to stand here at a lecture and devote some time to saying that black people and white people and Asian people and Latin American people and women and men and gays and straights, that we are all human, that our differences are superficial, and that we should treat each other with care and respect. I would have thought we would have figured that out by now. I thought that basic notion was well established. But it turns out, as we’re seeing in this recent drift into reactionary politics, that the struggle for basic justice is never truly finished. So we’ve got to constantly be on the lookout and fight for people who seek to elevate themselves by putting somebody else down. And by the way, we also have to actively resist – this is important, particularly in some countries in Africa like my own father’s homeland; I’ve made this point before – we have to resist the notion that basic human rights like freedom to dissent, or the right of women to fully participate in the society, or the right of minorities to equal treatment, or the rights of people not to be beat up and jailed because of their sexual orientation – we have to be careful not to say that somehow, well, that doesn’t apply to us, that those are Western ideas rather than universal imperatives. Again, Madiba, he anticipated things. He knew what he was talking about. In 1964, before he received the sentence that condemned him to die in prison, he explained from the dock that, “The Magna Carta, the Petition of Rights, the Bill of Rights are documents which are held in veneration by democrats throughout the world.” In other words, he didn’t say well, those books weren’t written by South Africans so I just – I can’t claim them. No, he said that’s part of my inheritance. That’s part of the human inheritance. That applies here in this country, to me, and to you. And that’s part of what gave him the moral authority that the apartheid regime could never claim, because he was more familiar with their best values than they were. He had read their documents more carefully than they had. And he went on to say, “Political division based on colour is entirely artificial and, when it disappears, so will the domination of one colour group by another.” That’s Nelson Mandela speaking in 1964, when I was three years old. What was true then remains true today. Basic truths do not change. It is a truth that can be embraced by the English, and by the Indian, and by the Mexican and by the Bantu and by the Luo and by the American. It is a truth that lies at the heart of every world religion – that we should do unto others as we would have them do unto us. That we see ourselves in other people. That we can recognise common hopes and common dreams. And it is a truth that is incompatible with any form of discrimination based on race or religion or gender or sexual orientation. And it is a truth that, by the way, when embraced, actually delivers practical benefits, since it ensures that a society can draw upon the talents and energy and skill of all its people. And if you doubt that, just ask the French football team that just won the World Cup. Because not all of those folks – not all of those folks look like Gauls to me. But they’re French. They’re French. Embracing our common humanity does not mean that we have to abandon our unique ethnic and national and religious identities. Madiba never stopped being proud of his tribal heritage. He didn’t stop being proud of being a black man and being a South African. But he believed, as I believe, that you can be proud of your heritage without denigrating those of a different heritage. In fact, you dishonor your heritage. It would make me think that you’re a little insecure about your heritage if you’ve got to put somebody else’s heritage down. Yeah, that’s right. Don’t you get a sense sometimes – again, I’m ad-libbing here – that these people who are so intent on putting people down and puffing themselves up that they’re small-hearted, that there’s something they’re just afraid of. Madiba knew that we cannot claim justice for ourselves when it’s only reserved for some. Madiba understood that we can’t say we’ve got a just society simply because we replaced the colour of the person on top of an unjust system, so the person looks like us even though they’re doing the same stuff, and somehow now we’ve got justice. That doesn’t work. It’s not justice if now you’re on top, so I’m going to do the same thing that those folks were doing to me and now I’m going to do it to you. That’s not justice. “I detest racialism,” he said, “whether it comes from a black man or a white man.” Now, we have to acknowledge that there is disorientation that comes from rapid change and modernisation, and the fact that the world has shrunk, and we’re going to have to find ways to lessen the fears of those who feel threatened. In the West’s current debate around immigration, for example, it’s not wrong to insist that national borders matter; whether you’re a citizen or not is going to matter to a government, that laws need to be followed; that in the public realm newcomers should make an effort to adapt to the language and customs of their new home. Those are legitimate things and we have to be able to engage people who do feel as if things are not orderly. But that can’t be an excuse for immigration policies based on race, or ethnicity, or religion. There’s got to be some consistency. And we can enforce the law while respecting the essential humanity of those who are striving for a better life. For a mother with a child in her arms, we can recognise that could be somebody in our family, that could be my child. Third, Madiba reminds us that democracy is about more than just elections. When he was freed from prison, Madiba’s popularity – well, you couldn’t even measure it. He could have been president for life. Am I wrong? Who was going to run against him? I mean, Ramaphosa was popular, but come on. Plus he was a young – he was too young. Had he chose, Madiba could have governed by executive fiat, unconstrained by check and balances. But instead he helped guide South Africa through the drafting of a new constitution, drawing from all the institutional practices and democratic ideals that had proven to be most sturdy, mindful of the fact that no single individual possesses a monopoly on wisdom. No individual – not Mandela, not Obama – are entirely immune to the corrupting influences of absolute power, if you can do whatever you want and everyone’s too afraid to tell you when you’re making a mistake. No one is immune from the dangers of that. Mandela understood this. He said, “Democracy is based on the majority principle. This is especially true in a country such as ours where the vast majority have been systematically denied their rights. At the same time, democracy also requires the rights of political and other minorities be safeguarded.” He understood it’s not just about who has the most votes. It’s also about the civic culture that we build that makes democracy work. So we have to stop pretending that countries that just hold an election where sometimes the winner somehow magically gets 90% of the vote because all the opposition is locked up – or can’t get on TV, is a democracy. Democracy depends on strong institutions and it’s about minority rights and checks and balances, and freedom of speech and freedom of expression and a free press, and the right to protest and petition the government, and an independent judiciary, and everybody having to follow the law. And yes, democracy can be messy, and it can be slow, and it can be frustrating. I know, I promise. But the efficiency that’s offered by an autocrat, that’s a false promise. Don’t take that one, because it leads invariably to more consolidation of wealth at the top and power at the top, and it makes it easier to conceal corruption and abuse. For all its imperfections, real democracy best upholds the idea that government exists to serve the individual and not the other way around. And it is the only form of government that has the possibility of making that idea real. So for those of us who are interested in strengthening democracy, let’s also stop – it’s time for us to stop paying all of our attention to the world’s capitals and the centers of power and to start focusing more on the grassroots, because that’s where democratic legitimacy comes from. Not from the top down, not from abstract theories, not just from experts, but from the bottom up. Knowing the lives of those who are struggling. As a community organiser, I learned as much from a laid-off steel worker in Chicago or a single mom in a poor neighbourhood that I visited as I learned from the finest economists in the Oval Office. Democracy means being in touch and in tune with life as it’s lived in our communities, and that’s what we should expect from our leaders, and it depends upon cultivating leaders at the grassroots who can help bring about change and implement it on the ground and can tell leaders in fancy buildings, this isn’t working down here. And to make democracy work, Madiba shows us that we also have to keep teaching our children, and ourselves – and this is really hard – to engage with people not only who look different but who hold different views. This is hard. Most of us prefer to surround ourselves with opinions that validate what we already believe. You notice the people who you think are smart are the people who agree with you. Funny how that works. But democracy demands that we’re able also to get inside the reality of people who are different than us so we can understand their point of view. Maybe we can change their minds, but maybe they’ll change ours. And you can’t do this if you just out of hand disregard what your opponents have to say from the start. And you can’t do it if you insist that those who aren’t like you – because they’re white, or because they’re male – that somehow there’s no way they can understand what I’m feeling, that somehow they lack standing to speak on certain matters. Madiba, he lived this complexity. In prison, he studied Afrikaans so that he could better understand the people who were jailing him. And when he got out of prison, he extended a hand to those who had jailed him, because he knew that they had to be a part of the democratic South Africa that he wanted to build. “To make peace with an enemy,” he wrote, “one must work with that enemy, and that enemy becomes one’s partner.” So those who traffic in absolutes when it comes to policy, whether it’s on the left or the right, they make democracy unworkable. You can’t expect to get 100% of what you want all the time; sometimes, you have to compromise. That doesn’t mean abandoning your principles, but instead it means holding on to those principles and then having the confidence that they’re going to stand up to a serious democratic debate. That’s how America’s Founders intended our system to work – that through the testing of ideas and the application of reason and proof it would be possible to arrive at a basis for common ground. And I should add for this to work, we have to actually believe in an objective reality. This is another one of these things that I didn’t have to lecture about. You have to believe in facts. Without facts, there is no basis for cooperation. If I say this is a podium and you say this is an elephant, it’s going to be hard for us to cooperate. I can find common ground for those who oppose the Paris Accords because, for example, they might say, well, it’s not going to work, you can’t get everybody to cooperate, or they might say it’s more important for us to provide cheap energy for the poor, even if it means in the short term that there’s more pollution. At least I can have a debate with them about that and I can show them why I think clean energy is the better path, especially for poor countries, that you can leapfrog old technologies. I can’t find common ground if somebody says climate change is just not happening, when almost all of the world’s scientists tell us it is. I don’t know where to start talking to you about this. If you start saying it’s an elaborate hoax, I don’t know what to – where do we start? Unfortunately, too much of politics today seems to reject the very concept of objective truth. People just make stuff up. They just make stuff up. We see it in state-sponsored propaganda; we see it in internet driven fabrications, we see it in the blurring of lines between news and entertainment, we see the utter loss of shame among political leaders where they’re caught in a lie and they just double down and they lie some more. Politicians have always lied, but it used to be if you caught them lying they’d be like, “Oh man.” Now they just keep on lying. By the way, this is what I think Mama Graça was talking about in terms of maybe some sense of humility that Madiba felt, like sometimes just basic stuff, me not completely lying to people seems pretty basic, I don’t think of myself as a great leader just because I don’t completely make stuff up. You’d think that was a base line. Anyway, we see it in the promotion of anti-intellectualism and the rejection of science from leaders who find critical thinking and data somehow politically inconvenient. And, as with the denial of rights, the denial of facts runs counter to democracy, it could be its undoing, which is why we must zealously protect independent media; and we have to guard against the tendency for social media to become purely a platform for spectacle, outrage, or disinformation; and we have to insist that our schools teach critical thinking to our young people, not just blind obedience. Which, I’m sure you are thankful for, leads to my final point: we have to follow Madiba’s example of persistence and of hope. It is tempting to give in to cynicism: to believe that recent shifts in global politics are too powerful to push back; that the pendulum has swung permanently. Just as people spoke about the triumph of democracy in the 90s, now you are hearing people talk about end of democracy and the triumph of tribalism and the strong man. We have to resist that cynicism. Because, we’ve been through darker times, we’ve been in lower valleys and deeper valleys. Yes, by the end of his life, Madiba embodied the successful struggle for human rights, but the journey was not easy, it wasn’t pre-ordained. The man went to prison for almost three decades. He split limestone in the heat, he slept in a small cell, and was repeatedly put in solitary confinement. And I remember talking to some of his former colleagues saying how they hadn’t realised when they were released, just the sight of a child, the idea of holding a child, they had missed – it wasn’t something available to them, for decades. And yet his power actually grew during those years – and the power of his jailers diminished, because he knew that if you stick to what’s true, if you know what’s in your heart, and you’re willing to sacrifice for it, even in the face of overwhelming odds, that it might not happen tomorrow, it might not happen in the next week, it might not even happen in your lifetime. Things may go backwards for a while, but ultimately, right makes might, not the other way around, ultimately, the better story can win out and as strong as Madiba’s spirit may have been, he would not have sustained that hope had he been alone in the struggle, part of buoyed him up was that he knew that each year, the ranks of freedom fighters were replenishing, young men and women, here in South African, in the ANC and beyond; black and Indian and white, from across the countryside, across the continent, around the world, who in those most difficult days would keep working on behalf of his vision. And that’s what we need right now, we don’t just need one leader, we don’t just need one inspiration, what we badly need right now is that collective spirit. And, I know that those young people, those hope carriers are gathering around the world. Because history shows that whenever progress is threatened, and the things we care about most are in question, we should heed the words of Robert Kennedy – spoken here in South Africa, he said, “Our answer is the world’s hope: it is to rely on youth. It’s to rely on the spirit of the young.” So, young people, who are in the audience, who are listening, my message to you is simple, keep believing, keep marching, keep building, keep raising your voice. Every generation has the opportunity to remake the world. Mandela said, “Young people are capable, when aroused, of bringing down the towers of oppression and raising the banners of freedom.” Now is a good time to be aroused. Now is a good time to be fired up. And, for those of us who care about the legacy that we honour here today – about equality and dignity and democracy and solidarity and kindness, those of us who remain young at heart, if not in body – we have an obligation to help our youth succeed. Some of you know, here in South Africa, my foundation is convening over the last few days, two hundred young people from across this continent who are doing the hard work of making change in their communities; who reflect Madiba’s values, who are poised to lead the way. People like Abaas Mpindi, a journalist from Uganda, who founded the Media Challenge Initiative, to help other young people get the training they need to tell the stories that the world needs to know. People like Caren Wakoli, an entrepreneur from Kenya, who founded the Emerging Leaders Foundation to get young people involved in the work of fighting poverty and promoting human dignity. People like Enock Nkulanga, who directs the African Children’s mission, which helps children in Uganda and Kenya get the education that they need and then in his spare time, Enock advocates for the rights of children around the globe, and founded an organisation called LeadMinds Africa, which does exactly what it says. You meet these people, you talk to them, they will give you hope. They are taking the baton, they know they can’t just rest on the accomplishments of the past, even the accomplishments of those as momentous as Nelson Mandela’s. They stand on the shoulders of those who came before, including that young black boy born 100 years ago, but they know that it is now their turn to do the work. Madiba reminds us that: “No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart.” Love comes more naturally to the human heart, let’s remember that truth. Let’s see it as our North Star, let’s be joyful in our struggle to make that truth manifest here on earth so that in 100 years from now, future generations will look back and say, ‘they kept the march going, that’s why we live under new banners of freedom.’ Thank you very much, South Africa, thank you.",Barack Obama; US news; Donald Trump; World news,US news
