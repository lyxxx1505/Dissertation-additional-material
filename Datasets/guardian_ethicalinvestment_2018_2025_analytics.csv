2024-12-02T09:00:19Z,"More than three-quarters of UK universities join fossil fuel pledge, say activists",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/dec/02/more-than-three-quarters-of-uk-universities-join-fossil-fuel-pledge-say-activists,"More than three-quarters of UK universities have pledged to exclude fossil fuel companies from their investment portfolios, according to campaigners. The move, which is part of a wider drive to limit investment in fossil fuels, follows years of campaigning by staff and students across the higher education sector. The student campaign group People &amp; Planet announced on Friday that 115 out of 149 UK universities had publicly committed to divest from fossil fuels – meaning £17.7bn-worth of endowments are now out of reach of the fossil fuel industry. Laura Clayson, from People &amp; Planet, said it would have been unthinkable a decade ago that so many institutions had formally refused to invest in fossil fuels. “That we can celebrate this today is down to the generations of students and staff that have fought for justice in solidarity with impacted communities. The days of UK universities profiteering from investments in this neo-colonial industry are over.” People &amp; Planet set up the Fossil Free universities campaign in 2013. As part of its efforts the group has highlighted the “struggles and voices” of communities on the frontline of the climate crisis in an attempt to bring home the real-world impact of investment decisions made by UK universities. Clayson said: “The demand for fossil-free came from frontline communities themselves and it is an act of solidarity from global north organisers campaigning on this … We have a responsibility to speak the lived experiences of the communities resisting these inequalities into megaphones at protests and in negotiations within university boardrooms, to highlight their stories of struggle in spaces so often detached from the reality of everyday life on the frontlines.” One of the projects highlighted by the campaign is the proposed East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) – a mega project that would stretch almost 900 miles from the Lake Albert region of Uganda to the coast in Tanzania, and release vast amounts of planet-heating carbon. The pipeline is being built in spite of local opposition, and there are reports that protesters and critics have been met with state violence. Hundreds of student organisers have been involved in the struggle. Ntambazi Imuran Java, the lead coordinator at the Stop EACOP Uganda campaign, said its members appreciated the efforts of UK students to bring an end to universities’ fossil fuel investments. “[This] supports those who have worked tirelessly to stop deadly extraction projects like EACOP … Regardless of the arrests and violations on the activists, students’ activists and communities, we continue to demand for the Uganda authorities to stop the project and instead invest in renewables.” People &amp; Planet said four UK institutions – Birmingham City University, Glasgow School of Art, Royal Northern College of Music and the University of Bradford – had recently incorporated fossil fuel exclusions into their ethical investment policies, meaning 115 out of 149 UK universities have publicly committed to divest from fossil fuels. Later this month, the group will group will unveil its latest university league table that ranks institutions by their ethical and environmental performance. Campaigners say they will then increase pressure on the remaining 34 UK universities yet to go fossil-free.",Universities; Education; Higher education; Fossil fuels; Energy; Environment; UK news; Environmental activism; People & Planet Green League,Education
2025-04-17T06:06:21Z,Can your super be good for you and the planet?,https://www.theguardian.com/australian-ethical-invest-in-a-better-tomorrow/2025/apr/17/can-your-super-be-good-for-you-and-the-planet,"Why do I need to worry about what my super fund is investing in? Australian superannuation funds invest trillions of dollars held in 22.2m member accounts. Our money makes things happen. It’s invested in everything from infrastructure, equities, property, retail and banks to gambling, tobacco and fossil fuels. Anyone concerned about social harm, human rights, environmental degradation or climate change might want to look closely at how and where their money is invested. If you’re making choices in your everyday life to do better, such as by choosing certain brands, recycling or using renewable energy, consider how this could be amplified by directing your retirement savings into projects and businesses that do good on a bigger scale. What is ethical super – and how do funds’ approaches differ? Funds differ in their approaches to ethical investment. One fund, or investment option, might only screen out certain sectors, while another might also look for companies and projects that do good, and allocate capital towards them. Lots of different labels are used to describe investment approaches, which can make it difficult to assess at a glance how ethical a fund is. The lines are blurred between the terms ethical, sustainable and responsible. Some approaches sound good but may not be what you are looking for. Applying an ESG (environmental, social and governance) filter, for example, is about assessing financial risk rather than making judgments based on ethics, and could lead to portfolios containing companies you don’t approve of. It’s also worth noting that ethics vary from one individual to the next. What you consider ethical and what a fund considers ethical may not be the same thing. Is the focus on returns, or ethics, or both? Look at the investment options in most super funds and you’ll find a range of categories to choose from. These categories are often focused on your stage of investing and appetite for risk, rather than the ethical nature of the investments. Even when super funds offer choices, most are primarily focused on returns. You’ll find high-growth (and high-risk) investment options, or more conservative options with lower risk, often favoured by people close to retirement. Some funds also offer ethical investment options. Australian Ethical specialises in them; investments in sectors such as fossil fuels, nuclear energy and tobacco are restricted, while investments in sectors such as renewables, healthcare and IT are supported. How ethical investments are chosen varies between funds, and between investment options within funds, but the goal is always to get good returns as well as invest ethically. My fund says it is one of the good ones. How can I check? Since March 2022, super funds have been obliged to provide publicly accessible twice-yearly portfolio holdings disclosure statements, which outline the composition of the investment options they offer. However, if you’re not a finance nerd, these statements can be overwhelming. Luckily, they are not the only tools at your disposal. You may find reports on ethical funds in the media. The funds themselves can also be a source of information; many are keen to explain their different approaches to investing, and offer detailed information about their ethos and investment choices. The Responsible Investment Association Australasia (RIAA) ranks ethical super funds on an investment scorecard in its annual responsible leaders report. Organisations such as Market Forces, which exposes institutions financing environmentally destructive projects, or Choice, can also help you determine if your super fund or investment option is the right one for you. I need my money to work hard – can ethical investing deliver strong returns? Research has found that many ethical funds or investment options perform just as well as, if not better than, standard superannuation offerings. The fund researcher SuperRatings benchmarks the performance of super funds with ethical options, and in 2024 ranked Australian Ethical’s Australian shares option number one for returns over 10 years out of 39 funds. The ATO, Canstar and Finder all offer comparison tools through which you can see how your fund is performing. If you’re unhappy with the ethics of your fund’s investments, the Responsible Returns comparison website can help you find an ethical super fund that meets your criteria.

2025-03-06T13:07:51Z,"Treat weapons investments as ‘ethical’ to help arm Ukraine and UK, MPs urge",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/06/investment-weapons-manufacturers-arms-esg-defence-spending-ukraine-uk,"Banks, investors and pension funds should treat weapons manufacturers as “ethical” investments so that more money goes to the industry to arm Ukraine and the UK, according to a group of more than 100 Labour MPs and peers. Ninety-six MPs and six peers have signed an open letter calling for financial businesses to “sweep away ill-considered anti-defence rules which are acting as a barrier to doing what is right”, in another sign of the backlash against environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies. Donald Trump’s talks with Russia and denial of US military aid and intelligence to Ukraine this week have prompted a scramble by European countries to boost defence spending. Keir Starmer has said the UK will increase spending to 2.5% of GDP, up from 2.3%, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, has pledged a raise, while Germany’s incoming chancellor, Friedrich Merz, wants to loosen strict debt rules to fund an increase. On Thursday the Italian defence group Leonardo announced a deal with the Turkish drone-maker Baykar to try to rapidly increase the manufacture of unmanned weapons for Ukraine within Europe. Roberto Cingolani, Leonardo’s chief executive, told the Financial Times Trump’s verbal “attacks” on Europe had given the region “an unprecedented sense of urgency” to spend more on defence. The Labour politicians who signed the letter argued that ESG rules adopted by some institutions have held back defence spending, echoing a longstanding gripe from weapons company bosses. However, it is unclear whether ESG rules have held back investment in defence companies. The industry’s stock market value has soared in recent weeks in anticipation of higher spending. The market value of BAE Systems, the British maker of weapons ranging from shells to fighter jets and submarines, has nearly tripled since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war. The huge share-price surge of Rolls-Royce, which makes fighter jet engines and submarine reactors, has also benefited from increased defence spending, while the valuations of the British plane parts maker Melrose and the military services company Babcock International have more than doubled since the start of Russia’s invasion. The peers who signed the letter included George Robertson, a former Nato secretary general who is working on a strategic defence review for Labour. “There can be no more ethical investment than giving the Ukrainian people every ounce of support that can be mustered by their allies,” the letter said. The letter was led by Alex Baker, MP for Aldershot, known as the home of the British army because it is the site of a major garrison. Baker won Aldershot for Labour in last year’s general election for the first time since the seat was created in 1918. That highlighted the scale of the landslide victory, but also the party’s renewed support for the armed forces. Starmer has been a keen proponent of the UK defence sector. His predecessor as Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was much more critical of weapons spending after a career campaigning against arms exports to countries accused of humans rights abuses. Baker said: “The businesses I speak to in Aldershot and Farnborough are ready to step up and help deliver the new defence capabilities this moment demands – but badly composed ESG rules are stifling the innovation we need to fire up our industrial base.” Emily Apple, from the UK-based Campaign Against the Arms Trade, said the manufacturers who would benefit from relaxing ESG rules “make vast profits from death and destruction across the world”.",Investing; Arms trade; Defence policy; Stock markets; Politics; Europe; UK news; Business,Business
2024-12-20T09:32:14Z,University bans on big oil firms at recruitment fairs rise by 30%,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/dec/20/university-bans-on-big-oil-firms-at-recruitment-fairs-rise-by-30,"More universities are banning fossil fuel companies from recruitment fairs in a sign of the sector’s shrinking social licence among young people. The annual survey of sustainability and ethics in higher education found there has been a 30% rise in the number of institutions stopping fossil fuel companies taking part in graduate fairs this year. The move, which is part of a wider drive to limit investment in big oil, follows years of campaigning by staff and students across the higher education sector. Josie Mizen, of the student campaign group People and Planet, which carries out the survey, said: “We’re delighted to see universities who’ve taken this vital step leading the way in this year’s university league. As the climate crisis escalates, more and more universities are realising that climate justice can only be achieved by cutting ties with the fossil fuel industry.” The survey found that the vast majority of the university sector had committed to divesting from fossil fuel companies, although many still needed to follow through on that pledge. Ten had also decided to end their links via recruitment to environmentally destructive industries, up 30% since last year. Laura Clayson, the campaigns manager at People and Planet, said there was more work to be done: “Only 55% of UK universities have exclusions for fossil fuel extractor companies in their ethical investment policies, despite 78% having made public commitments to go fossil free … we look forward to the sector aligning their policies with their proclamations in recognition of these demands for justice.” This year’s survey ranked 149 UK universities based on 14 criteria linked to climate and social justice. It found that universities established since 1992 continued to lead the way, claiming seven of the top 10 places. Just four of the Russell Group of universities scored the highest marks this year, down from six in 2023. Andre Dallas, of People and Planet, said the progress among most universities was owing to the determination of student campaigns. “Over the past year particularly, students across the UK have been unequivocal in their stance that they won’t allow their universities to continue to invest in blatant injustices like the hostile environment and climate collapse.” The University of Bedfordshire was named as the overall winner, having finished in the top three for the past three years. The report found the university had taken steps to divest endowment funds from the fossil fuel industry and to end recruitment links with oil, gas and mining companies. They scored highly for their energy sources and carbon reduction after investing in renewable energy generated on campus over the past 10 years.",People & Planet Green League; Higher education; Sustainability; Fossil fuels; Fossil fuel divestment; Universities; Climate crisis; Oil and gas companies; Oil; Energy industry; Energy; Education; Environment; Business; UK news,Education
2025-05-29T05:48:16Z,Ask the experts: how do you make your money matter?,https://www.theguardian.com/australian-ethical-make-your-money-matter/2025/may/29/ask-the-experts-how-do-you-make-your-money-matter,"The rising cost of living undoubtedly affects the choices we can make, but research suggests Australian shoppers are still driven by their personal values. Sustainability is one of the biggest considerations. When Monash University surveyed Australian shoppers in 2024, 46% said sustainability was an important factor when they were making a retail purchase, while 30% frequently looked for sustainable products. Ethical supply chains, animal welfare, and commitments to diversity and inclusion are also common considerations for consumers, other research has found. This thinking affects decisions about products and services, but experts say to see real impact, we need to apply ethics to our financial and superannuation choices, too. Investing in change Many Australians already do this. Research conducted by the Responsible Investment Association Australasia (RIAA) found that in 2024, 88% of Australians expected their investments to be responsible and ethical, up from 83% in 2022, while 65% said they would invest more if their investments made a positive impact in the the world (up from 61% in 2022). The RIAA’s co-CEO, Estelle Parker, suggests we carefully consider our individual values when choosing where our money goes. Almost all of us are investing in shares and other assets via the choices our super funds make on our behalf – which don’t necessarily fit with our own values. Fortunately, it’s easy to switch to a fund that’s more aligned. “The first thing is to decide what they want to achieve with their investment portfolio,” Parker says. “People can look at the websites of the funds they’re considering and make sure that those funds actually do support their values.” Every super fund is legally required to disclose its investments, but the disclosure isn’t always that easy to find or understand. Fortunately, there are tools that can help. Parker recommends checking out Responsible Returns, an independent source of information about super funds’ portfolio holdings, and Market Forces’ regular reports on how the finance industry contributes to climate change. Responsible Investment Association Australasia CEO, Estelle Parker Every Australian has the power to make a difference “We are all in a position to make a small difference through our super or other investment portfolios,” Parker says. “People are cottoning onto that, and the growing demand is being met by really good quality financial investment options that people can take advantage of. One of the funds featured on the Responsible Returns website is Australian Ethical. Alison George, Australian Ethical’s chief impact and ethics officer, spends a good part of her working week making sure that where Australian Ethical invests its customers’ money – which adds up to more than $13bn in managed funds and super – reflects the organisation’s values and those of its customers. “Australians have a choice of which super fund they have and can move that money at any time,” George says. “You are making a choice, whether you’re making an active one or not.” Doing nothing, George says, is an action in itself. “At Australian Ethical we have a theory of change for the future that guides the way we approach business and approach investment. We believe that if consumers vote with their choices and move to the funds that care about people, planet and animals, this kind of investing can grow. “One day it could just be normal for investments to consider the impact on the environment and society as well as the impact on the bottom line, and money can become a force for good.” Australian Ethical chief impact and ethics officer, Alison George Values-driven choices make our money matter For many people, super is one of the largest investments we will make in our lifetimes – and together we can use it to make significant impact. “The choices that we make as individuals do matter,” George says. “Like climate change: we know it’s an urgent threat. We know that as individuals, it’s hard for us to tackle and engage with. But your money aggregated with others, invested for positive climate solutions for the future, is a great way that you can be doing your part to shift the dial on that issue.” Will van de Pol is the CEO at Market Forces, which holds Australian financial institutions to account on climate. He says values-driven decisions are one of the most powerful ways we can make our money matter. “When it comes to taking on some of the world’s biggest challenges – like climate change – ensuring that your power as the customer is used in a way that drives solutions to problems is incredibly important and powerful,” he says. “The point is to make decisions about what you value most highly and see as ethical, and follow that through with your decision-making.” Market Forces CEO, Will van de Pol Super can be a catalyst for change Australians who care about sustainability might choose to buy locally grown produce or an electric vehicle. If fair working conditions are important, they might research a product’s supply chain or find alternatives to fast fashion. George says: “We’re all busy people – but the idea here is to start acting on what you know and think about making better choices, rather than doing nothing while you wait for perfect information. “When you have time, put that effort into things that are more impactful and bigger choices for you. The car you drive, your bank, your super fund – they’re all good examples of decisions that can have really broad-ranging and long-term impacts. Australian Ethical is seeing more people making values-based choices about their super, George says. “People are recognising the importance of their superannuation money as something that they want to make sure is invested well, for themselves, for the planet and for society as well.” With $4.2tn held in super – more money than Australia’s GDP – the potential for supporting change is profound. Imagine if all of that money was invested in companies trying to change the world for the better. A super fund that aligns with our values is one way we can become part of a force for good.

2024-11-13T16:14:41Z,University of Rochester investigates ‘wanted’ posters targeting staff,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/13/university-rochester-wanted-posters,"The University of Rochester is investigating after hundreds of “wanted” posters featuring members of the university community were discovered around campus late on Sunday night. The president of the University of Rochester in New York, Sarah Mangelsdorf, denounced the posters in a statement. Mangelsdorf said that they targeted senior university leaders as well as members of faculty, staff and Board of Trustees, adding that “several of those depicted appear to have been targeted because they are members of our Jewish community”. Mangelsdorf called the incident “disturbing, divisive and intimidating”. “We view this as antisemitism, which will not be tolerated at our university,” she said. “This isn’t who we are. This goes against everything we stand for and we have an obligation to reject it.” The president also noted that the school’s department of public safety was leading an investigation into the incident. However, pro-Palestinian advocates unconnected to the posters criticized the university for the antisemitism allegations, arguing that they also featured non-Jews and were intended to highlight support for Israel’s offensive in Gaza. Photos of several of the posters show some individuals being accused of “hate speech”, “inflammatory language”, “misuse of power”, “ethnic cleansing”, the “displacement of Palestinians” and more. School officials were made aware of the posters displayed across campus buildings, including classrooms, on Sunday night, according to the school’s department of public safety. Quchee Collins, the University of Rochester’s associate vice-president for the department of public safety, said that staff with university facilities immediately began working to remove the posters. Collins described the removal process as “painstaking” due to the “strong adhesive” used to affix the posters. He added that in some cases the adhesive caused damage to “walls, floors, chalkboards, and other surfaces”. “Posters and displays affixed in this manner are unacceptable and considered to be vandalism to university property,” Collins said. Collins said it appeared that “the goal of this vandalism is to intimidate members of our University community,” an action that ran counter to the school’s “meliora values”. “Our priority as a university is to maintain a respectful and safe community for everyone, and we appreciate everyone’s engagement in supporting that expectation,” he continued. “We will inform the community as we continue our investigation.” On Tuesday Chuck Schumer, a New York senator and the Democratic Senate majority leader, condemned the incident in a statement on X. “Targeting Jewish and other professors with ‘WANTED’ posters is rank intimidation. And antisemitic,” Schumer said. “I am in contact with administrators at @UofR and have urged them to investigate swiftly. Those responsible must be held fully accountable. These actions must be condemned loudly.” Joe Morelle, the representative from New York’s 25th congressional district, which includes the university’s campus, also issued a statement on Tuesday, denouncing the posters as antisemitic. “I strongly condemn all forms of antisemitism and hate, which have no place in our society,” Morelle said on X. “I stand firmly with the Jewish community, advocating for respect, understanding, and unity in the face of these troubling incidents.” The university’s Hillel organization, which represents Jewish students, said in a statement that among those targeted in the posters were the Hillel director, as well as “Jewish faculty and staff and university administrators”. The organization said that no students were targeted. “These deeply disturbing posters, which disproportionately singled out Jewish faculty and staff, spread harmful antisemitic ideas about the Jewish people and Israel,” the organization said. “They further the spread of antisemitic hate on our campus in an attempt to sow fear.” In February, swastikas and antisemitic language were found written on tunnel walls on the university’s River campus. The words and symbols were promptly removed, and the school denounced the vandalism at the time, saying that the “use of antisemitic symbols and language and other forms of hate will not be tolerated under any circumstances on university property”. So far, no group or individual on campus has claimed responsibility for the posters that were put up on Sunday. In a statement on Tuesday, the student-run school chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace said it did not know who put up the posters or the intention behind them, but that it viewed the posters “as an attempt to shed light on administrators and professors’ support for the Israeli military’s destruction of Gaza”. “The posters highlighted Jewish and non-Jewish administrators and professors and explicitly condemned their support for the Israeli military and government,” the group wrote. “The administration’s hasty jump to attribute these posters to antisemitism, without any proper investigation, comes across as an attempt to censor any discussion of the University of Rochester’s complicity in the Israeli army’s ongoing genocide in Gaza.” The day before the “wanted” posters appeared on campus last weekend, the university’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine voiced concerns over a photo it said was plastered “all over the college” depicting a destroyed Lego project, titled “Gaza”. Since last October, the University of Rochester, like many other college campuses across the country, has had demonstrations and encampments on campus protesting the war in Gaza, with protesters calling on the school to support a ceasefire and to divest from companies tied to Israel, among other demands. Minutes from a February meeting of the school’s ethical investment advisory committee revealed that the university has exposure to $7.8m in Israel-related investments through its long-term investment pool, according to the Rochester Beacon.",New York; US universities; US news; Antisemitism; Judaism,US news
2024-02-22T13:27:30Z,Justin Welby: church should have asked more questions about ex-Post Office boss,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/feb/22/justin-welby-church-should-have-asked-more-questions-about-ex-post-office-boss,"The Church of England failed to challenge the involvement of Paula Vennells, the former Post Office boss and an Anglican priest, in Church of England bodies in light of the Horizon scandal, the archbishop of Canterbury has admitted. In his first public comments on the matter, Justin Welby said “more questions should have been asked” about Vennells, including her position on an ethical investment committee in 2019 and 2020. “It is clear that more questions should have been asked about the appropriateness of that involvement when more had come to light about the Horizon scandal. We recognise this and will need to reflect on it,” Welby said in response to a written question to the C of E ruling body, the General Synod, which meets in London this weekend. Welby declined to confirm or deny that Vennells had been interviewed for the post of bishop of London, the third most senior figure in the C of E, saying he was bound by confidentiality. In January, the BBC reported that Welby had “pushed her application and was seen as a supporter of her”. It said she was one of three people shortlisted for the post in 2017 while she was still chief executive of the Post Office. It was also reported on Thursday that Vennells would be stripped of her CBE this week. She offered to hand back her honour in January after the furore over the scandal caused by the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office, but the Times reported that she will be formally stripped of it by the honours forfeiture committee on Friday. Vennells was ordained as a C of E priest in 2006. She resigned as chief executive of the Post Office in February 2019 amid growing controversy over the Horizon scandal, in which hundreds of branch managers were prosecuted for theft and fraud as a result of faulty computer software. A month before Vennells resigned from the Post Office, she was appointed to the C of E’s ethical investment advisory group (EIAG). The committee that made the appointment was aware of the Post Office controversy but was “satisfied of her suitability to serve on the EIAG”, said Alan Smith, the first church estates commissioner, in a written answer. “There was further review of the matter as more information came to light, in line with the EIAG’s code of conduct. One of the lessons that the EIAG must take from this issue is that, to be effective, it has to be able to make risk management and moral decisions, while not prejudging legal outcomes, or crossing legal boundaries. The high standards that the EIAG seeks to influence in others, must be applied to itself,” Smith said. Vennells took a leave of absence from the EIAG in June 2020, and resigned from the committee in April 2021. She also quit as an associate minister in the St Albans diocese in 2021. Welby said: “The Post Office Horizon IT scandal is a terrible miscarriage of justice that has led to heartbreaking suffering for many subpostmasters. We hope and pray that the inquiry and the government’s promise of legislation will move forward the process of proper justice and compensation for the subpostmasters who have been so badly impacted.” Vennells has been approached for comment.",Post Office Horizon scandal; Justin Welby; Post Office; UK news; Anglicanism; Business,UK news
2024-10-01T22:40:22Z,Industry season three review – TV’s wildest drama is more thrilling than ever,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/oct/01/industry-season-three-review-tv-wildest-drama-is-more-thrilling-than-ever-bbc,"Mickey Down and Konrad Kay, creators and writers of Industry, are in a rare position both perilous and blessed. Their show, about young Londoners working at the brutal end of the financial sector, is a sleeper hit. More and more people have learned to speak its singular language and now, with the arrival of season three, Industry has the floor. The spotlight burns. Happily, its comeback episodes suggest this is the moment Down and Kay have been planning for all along. Industry returns with the pedal pressed down, with all the things that make it great intensified and sharpened. Goggling at it is more of a rush than ever. The main characters now live together in a beautifully chic townhouse that they can never enjoy because everyone’s always in the middle of a work crisis – it’s like This Life without the cosy domesticity. Top of the stress league table is Yas (Marisa Abela), the heiress whose investment banking career cannot escape the shadow of her crooked plutocrat father. When she arrives for a crucial day on the trading floor at Pierpoint, her annoying colleague’s screen is showing a story about Yas’s family, via the MailOnline’s sidebar of shame. Today is big because tomorrow is the IPO of Lumi, a green energy startup from the unique brain of the terrifically named Henry Muck (Kit Harington) – his surname being a signifier of the sort of privilege that gives people the confidence to play around with billions of pounds, and one letter different from the ultimate real-life example of the kind of pseudo-visionary modern high finance inexplicably reveres. “I find I sleep deeper under my desk,” says Muck during an interview with an unimpressed Amol Rajan (playing himself), in which Muck tries to come across as a chilled-out entertainer. “That was me being humorous. We can cut that, it didn’t really land.” A rich man’s futile quest to be funny and likable is one of a thousand contemporary observations Industry gets just right, but for the Pierpoint young ‘uns, convincing the market that Lumi is not a basket case is a serious business. Eric (Ken Leung), the boss of Yas and sensitive working-class conscience of the show Rob (Harry Lawtey), has his new senior management role to protect, a diktat from above to slim down his team by firing somebody, and a dodgy share price to inflate. These are the necessary conditions for bedlam, and Industry does not hold back. Whether it’s a sudden death or an impromptu evening of cocaine-fuelled confessions in the office of a half-dressed lawyer, big events that could have been saved for a season finale are burned through in the first episode, at the end of which everything is on fire. But none of it feels gratuitous: the show is tapped in to the absurdity of people playing a high-stakes game it is impossible to understand, because someone somewhere with more money than you is always tweaking the rules. That’s what has in the past made Industry temporarily impenetrable to newcomers. It’s all clear now, though, particularly the fact that if you zoom in closely enough, personal relationships and individual weaknesses are what matter. With everyone flailing in a complex web of secrets and hidden alliances, a phone call here or a well-managed argument there can mean professional life or death. Eric’s ultimate choice of who to sack is unpredictable until it becomes inevitable. Meanwhile, Industry keeps nailing the details as well as the massive narrative beats. The scene where Yas is summoned to a meeting with Muck, to find the supposedly funky green innovator shirtless on the fives court of a Piccadilly gentleman’s club, is blackly hilarious – but by the end of episode two, Yas’s encounters with the toxic men in her life have become powerfully shocking. Lifting the veil on the caprices of the super-wealthy is one way in which Industry is a post-Succession show; another lighter pleasure the two series share is the writers’ command of cultural flotsam and how people in the digital age interact. We are reacquainted with Harper (Myha’la) at her desk in her new dogsbody job at an ethical investment firm – you’ll need to hit pause to read the text she’s just received (“My Mubi account is about to expire and we still haven’t watched Decision to Leave – thoughts?”), and to see that she’s responding with a photo of herself with her hand down her knickers. By Industry standards that’s pretty mild, but it’s earned the right to be the wildest drama on TV and it doesn’t pass the opportunity up. “My cortisol levels!” says Anna’s boss as her position on Lumi turns to ash. “I constantly feel like there’s an active shooter in the building.” Industry thrives on that danger. • Industry airs on BBC One and is on iPlayer in the UK, and on Foxtel and Binge in Australia.",Television & radio; Culture; Television,Television & radio
2023-12-13T12:13:44Z,More UK universities cutting ties with fossil fuel industry,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/dec/13/more-uk-universities-cut-ties-with-fossil-fuel-industry,"More UK universities are cutting ties with the fossil fuel industry in response to student campaigns, according to the annual survey of sustainability in higher education. The student network People and Planet has published its sustainability university league showing that 72% of the universities it surveyed have committed to divesting from fossil fuels – up from 65% last year. Jack Ruane, the university league manager at People &amp; Planet, said there had been progress but much more needed to be done. “We are seeing much higher engagement from a broad range of universities, including the Russell Group, because universities recognise that students are increasingly demanding their institutions are run sustainably and ethically.” The Fossil Free campaign, active since 2013, has been led by students, who say it should not be acceptable for education and research institutions to invest in companies responsible for global heating. Students have used a range of campaign methods, from petitions gathering thousands of signatories, lobbying university management, political education and non-violent direct action, including occupying university buildings. This year’s league table assessed 151 institutions based on 13 categories including environmental policy and strategy, ethical investment and banking, carbon management and reduction and workers’ rights. For the first time, universities were also asked if they had a sustainable travel policy that included reducing emissions from aviation for staff travel. The institutions were then ranked and awarded a “first-class degree, 2:1, 2:2, third, or fail”. Seven universities made commitments to end recruitment “pipelines” to the fossil fuel industry, which campaigners say reflects a growing movement of young people who are refusing to work with big oil. The University of Reading topped the league table, up from fourth position in 2022-23. Ruane said its success was due to improvements in its carbon emissions, workers’ rights and ethical investment – including a commitment to screen out investments in companies complicit in the violation of international law. Manchester Metropolitan University was ranked second and the University of Bedfordshire third. Post-1992 universities ranked highly, gaining 66% of first class awards and three of the top five slots. Russell Group universities had only one in the top 10 in this year’s rankings – King’s College London. However, 58% of these institutions received a 2:1 award or higher, up from previous years. The Royal Veterinary College finished bottom of the table, with 3.4% overall – with other smaller and specialist universities also scoring less than 10% overall. The most dramatic improvement came from the University of Gloucestershire, which jumped 80 places, moving from a third last year to a first this time round. The Robert Gordon University leaped 58 places, moving from a third to 2:1 having made improvements in sustainability policies, and having recently committed to divesting from fossil fuels. The University of Birmingham shot up 51 places, gaining a 2:2 having previously scored a fail, meaning all Russell Group universities are scoring passing grades. On workers’ rights, 68 universities (45%) are accredited living wage employers, up from 33% last year. Seventy-four universities (49%) have more than a quarter of their staff on fixed-term contracts, showing the precarity of employment in the sector.",Sustainability; Fossil fuel divestment; Universities; Education; Higher education; UK news; Environment; Students; University administration; People & Planet Green League,Education
2024-09-08T11:00:45Z,How HBO’s Industry explores the unsatisfactory role-playing that workplaces demand of Black women ,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/sep/08/hbo-industry-workplace-black-women,"This article contains spoilers for multiple seasons of Industry. In her 2020 essay When Black Women Go From Office Pet to Office Threat, the writer Erika Stallings broke down the pipeline that many Black women go through at the corporate level. First lauded as miracle hires, or “office pets”, Black women, Stallings argues, are treated in a “child-like” fashion, as their bosses assume to know what’s best for them and assert what appropriate behavior is. Black women can quickly find themselves debased and scrutinized as “threats”, she writes, especially after hypercompetence or when they manage to secure positions of power. “Pets often experience feelings of tokenism, invisibility, pressure to assimilate, mistreatment, and being overprotected by colleagues,” Stallings wrote. “When Black women resist their status as pets, they find themselves transforming into a threat … [experiencing] microaggressions or punishment for challenging the status quo of the workplace.” Industry, the firestorm HBO financial drama now in its third season, offers an incisive look into this phenomenon, and into race, more broadly, in the modern-day workplace. The show’s protagonist, Harper Stern, shifts at various points between “pet” and “threat” throughout her career, in her vacillating attempts to stay ahead in the precarious financial world. But Industry argues that even when Black people “win” in white workplaces – when they embrace their status as “pets” or appeal to gatekeepers by working “twice as hard” (only to be rejected as “threats”) – they still lose. The show argues that there is never really a way for Stern as a Black woman (or anyone really) to “win” at capitalism, not without shelling out some part of themselves. Several television shows in recent memory have attempted to portray being Black at work: dealing with microaggressions from white co-workers, navigating pay disparities. Nella from The Other Black Girl and Molly and Issa from Insecure all tried to amend their workplaces. They rejected the notion that getting a seat at the table is enough, either questioning the table’s validity or at least trying to make more room for others. Industry, on the other hand, makes a point to show that some Black protagonists are just comfortable with a cushier chair. At the series’ start, Stern (played by Myha’la) is a hungry, young graduate at Pierpoint, a London investment bank. She is one of two Black people in her cohort, and the only Black American woman. Through a blend of shrewdness, smarts and calculated fraternizing (see: recreational drugs), Stern manages to secure a permanent position. She blasts through the firm’s ranks, an Icarian overachiever, by being ruthless, underhanded, constantly proving herself to be the firm’s best investment. Stern fully embraces her “threat” status. Despite several fumbles at work, she stays afloat by being a bold risk-taker, an attribute her white co-workers don’t have. Her wings are clipped only when she is fired by HR for falsifying a college transcript. Eric Tao (Ken Leung), Stern’s Asian American manager, blows her secret after becoming increasingly intimidated by her success. At her next job, Stern becomes a chameleon. She crafts a distinctly new identity after her traumatic dismissal from Pierpoint, a workplace she has given up long hours and her moral compass for. Set adrift post-firing, she attempts to wedge her way into the “office pet” role, which doesn’t quite fit her flair of ambition. Now working as a lowly assistant at the “ethical” investment fund FutureDawn, Stern speaks in a softer, more casual tone versus her usual sharpness. She wears cream wool sweater vests instead of structured blazers, making her appear more demure. When a white co-worker chastises Stern for her failure to recycle a disposable coffee cup, she offers a cordial apology where the old Harper would have offered a sarcastic put-down. Harper undergoes the unsatisfactory kind of role-playing that workplaces demand of Black women. But what’s most interesting is her desire to stay in the game. Despite repeated rejections and degradations, Harper is eager to remain in finance, attempting to best the system through the various fronts she puts on. In that vein, Industry also examines the strict conditions under which Harper’s ambition can survive and thrive. At Pierpoint, Stern’s sly and unsparing mentality wins her adoration, but ultimately leads to her downfall. Her attempts to “play the game” at FutureDawn, to etch out legitimate routes of success, are met with tight-lipped smiles and head shakes. Her pleas to be included in the company’s investment choices are shot down, emphasizing her ultimate status as an outsider. Stern makes some headway when she accepts the macro-aggressions lobbed at her, proving to others that she is above political correctness. For instance, at a climate conference in Aspen, Otto (Roger Barclay), the epitome of “white man capitalist”, questions how Stern got invited. “Why do you assume I’m not influential enough to make the list?” Stern asks. “Because you’re a diminutive woman,” Otto replies. When another white man, an “ally”, argues that climate change would be resolved if women were in charge, Stern barbs back: “I prefer the kind of feminism where women can be cunts.” In this moment, she has gained temporary respect for placating Otto’s sexism. But Stern goes even further, embracing her audacious nature to woo potential investors. After failing to secure funding for a startup hedge fund, she reveals a confidential plan in front of her current boss and former Pierpoint colleagues, including Tao, a petty revenge play that works in her favor. Stern has once again burned bridges, this time with FutureDawn, but she has also succeeded at her goal and established herself as a legitimate competitor and peer. Industry understands that Stern, as a Black woman, will always be in a vulnerable position. Yes, she has secured a temporary landing of triumph, but there is still the anxiety that at any point her victory could be washed away. She previously thought she had found bonafide success at Pierpoint, only to be summarily dismissed for her lack of credentials. Now she feels that her acumen has paid off, but even that has a provisional tinge. After all, she is winning a game – of success, of white approval – that is also playing her.",Television; Race; Women; US work & careers; HBO; Black US culture; Gender; Culture,Television & radio
2025-04-26T11:00:02Z,They staged protests for Palestine. The consequences have been life-changing,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/26/university-student-protesters-discipline,"EK was completing a take-home exam on 6 March when the dean of student conduct at Swarthmore College emailed her about an urgent Zoom meeting. On the video call, she said, the dean told her that she would be suspended for one semester for staging a protest at the college’s trustees’ dinner in December 2023. Using a bullhorn, EK had interrupted the event to demand that the school divest from products that fuel Israel’s war on Gaza. A panel of students and school employees had found her responsible for assault, among other code of conduct violations for the incident. EK, a final-semester senior who is using a pseudonym out of fear of retaliation, recalled being in shock: “I’ve been really distraught by all of this,” EK said. “I used to be unhoused before I came to Swarthmore, so to be put into this situation again is very disturbing.” She filed an appeal in mid-March and remained in campus housing until the school came to a decision on 10 April. A first-generation, low-income college student on financial aid, EK lost crucial finances when she was let go from her school job. She said she also fears she may be vulnerable to attacks from the Trump administration, which has penalized pro-Palestinian protesters: “I’m worried that this is not the end, and only the beginning, especially now that it’s on my record. It could be the case that I could face further punitive measures from the federal government, and the college is not doing anything to protect students.” In March, the Trump administration listed Swarthmore College as one of 60 schools at risk of losing hundreds of millions of federal dollars for allowing what it considered antisemitic harassment on campus. Colleges and universities across the country were already quashing pro-Palestinian protests by suspending and arresting students, and several revised their policies to ban encampments prior to Trump’s inauguration. But some have gone even further to penalize students in light of the government’s threats to pull their funding. In some cases, those preventive measures have been for naught. Columbia announced that it expelled students who occupied a building last year and revoked alumnis’ diplomas at the same time the federal government still cancelled $400m worth of contracts and grants to the university. Harvard University placed the undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee on probation and temporarily banned the pro-Palestinian group from hosting events, only for the Trump administration to freeze $2.2bn in federal grants to the school two weeks later. Though Columbia and Harvard have received the most attention for their responses to activists, campus crackdowns have been widespread. The Guardian spoke to 1o student protesters in Pennsylvania, California, Wisconsin and New York who have faced disciplinary action from their colleges and universities. They said that the process is often arbitrary and marked by fear tactics aimed to discourage them from protesting in the future. Building a defense for disciplinary hearings, they said, distracted them from their studies and caused anxiety, as the processes can last months. In some cases, the disciplinary process has no conclusive end, causing students to languish while being banned from campus or otherwise limited from participating in student life. Following pushback from students and faculty, EK said, Swarthmore College agreed to pay for her off-campus housing until the end of the semester. She is taking virtual classes and will be allowed to graduate on time, but she is still barred from attending on-campus events or from walking with her peers during graduation. In a statement to the Guardian, Swarthmore College spokesperson Alisa Giardinelli said that the school repeatedly warned student protesters that their actions were in violation of the college’s code of conduct, and that they would face disciplinary action if found responsible. Despite the college’s efforts to discuss the students’ demands, including that the school divest from weapons manufacturers that fuel Israel’s war on Gaza, “some students chose to continue to engage in – and in some cases escalated – behaviors that violated the Code”, Giardinelli said. Guardian interviews with student activists, attorneys and researchers reveal an increased sense of hostility on campuses since 7 October 2023, which has stoked fear and anxiety and resulted in financial concerns for some pro-Palestinian student protesters. Some attorneys have said that Palestinians, Arab Muslims, and people of color have been universities’ primary targets when repressing pro-Palestinian free speech. In March, the federal government went even further in targeting pro-Palestinian scholars and students of color by arresting and detaining the Georgetown University professor Badar Khan Suri and the Columbia graduate student Mahmoud Khalil. “A majority of students who are contacting us for support are either Palestinian, Arab Muslim or other students of color,” said the advocacy group Palestine Legal’s staff attorney, Tori Porell. Additionally, low-income students or those who rely on financial aid are hardest hit by disciplinary actions, she said: “Students who live on campus might rely on campus meal plans. If they are abruptly suspended, they are losing access to housing, to their food, to healthcare, and they might not have funds to just fly home the way some students with more resources would.” In 2024, Palestine Legal received more than 2,000 requests for legal assistance, with about two-thirds coming from students, staff or faculty on college campuses. While schools have long served as stages for mass protests including against the Vietnam war and South Africa’s apartheid, activists say that the universities’ actions toward them have had a chilling effect on civil disobedience this academic year. Still, students such as Dahlia Saba, a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, see it as their duty to continue pushing universities to divest from Israel, whose war on Gaza has killed at least 62,000 Palestinians since October 2023. Saba was at a conference in Colorado last July when she received a concerning text message from her schoolmate Vignesh Ramachandran. The two were being investigated by the University of Wisconsin-Madison for a May 2024 op-ed that they had written in a local publication. The article criticized the university’s failure to respond to a student-led proposal around transparent and ethical investment, and demanded that it divest from arms-manufacturing companies fueling Israel’s war on Gaza. She pulled up an email from the university about the charges that she faced, which included allegedly refusing to comply with rules about no picnicking or camping. (Wisconsin state statute prohibits tents or camping on undesignated parts of university land.) Saba, a graduate student in electrical engineering, recalled her thoughts in that moment: would the charges jeopardize her career, or prevent her from being vocal about Palestinian rights in the future? “For me, it’s still important to speak up,” Saba, a Palestinian American, told the Guardian, “because the point of these repression tactics is to try to silence us. And so I think that makes it all the more imperative to refuse to be silenced.” A ‘Palestine exception’ to free speech Since October 2023, many schools have responded to pro-Palestinian campus protests in an outsized way compared with demonstrations going back several decades, say attorneys. In a Harvard Crimson series, 11 former student activists said that Harvard’s response to pro-Palestinian protesters had been more violent and punitive than the treatment they experienced for protesting against South Africa’s apartheid, against fossil fuel divestment, and for university workers to be paid living wages. Race and political views may account for universities’ stricter policies and punishments since last year. Pointing to the Orange county district attorney’s list of people who had been suspended and arrested, Thomas Harvey, a California attorney who represents pro-Palestinian students facing criminal charges, said: “It’s very rare that it’s anyone other than people of color.” Harvey said he knows many of the students on the district attorney’s list because he’s represented them or provided them pro bono legal support. “It seems very obvious that race, combined with political viewpoints about being pro-Palestinian, are the targets of the most severe punishment.” UT, a Muslim woman of color and Swarthmore College senior, said that she was alarmed to learn how closely the college surveilled her during pro-Palestinian protests. On 6 March 2025, UT, who is using her initials out of fear of being doxxed, received an email from the school that she would be on probation until she graduated for violating the college’s code of conduct during rallies between October 2023 and March 2024. Last spring, she received a packet from the university on the evidence they had against her, including CCTV footage of her walking on a path next to the woods on campus. “It was a real moment of realization that there is so much surveillance on this campus, and especially out of the students that were charged, very few were white students. Most students were students of color, and first-generation, low-income students. And to learn that the college is so meticulously tracking these students – it was a very scary moment.” Giardinelli of Swarthmore College told the Guardian that “sanctions are based solely on alleged misconduct, without regard to race, socioeconomic standing, or identity”. Of the surveillance, she said: “CCTV images are only used, when available, to verify involved parties and behaviors that are suspected to be, or are alleged violations of, the Student Code of Conduct or of state and federal law.” Schools’ crackdowns on pro-Palestinian student protesters are indicative of a “Palestine exception” to free speech, said Farah Afify, a research and advocacy coordinator at the civil rights group Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair). As the co-author of Cair’s analysis on how universities target pro-Palestinian protesters, Afify consolidated incidents found in newspaper reports and education-related complaints that Afify received from October 2023 to May 2024. “Students who support Palestinian rights,” Afify said, “tend to face harsher discipline, harsher criticism, more challenges by people who would otherwise encourage that kind of expression because it meets the standard principles of what we’d expect of our institutions of higher education.” Cair has since launched a website where students can report their campuses to be investigated and placed on the organization’s “institutions of particular concern” list for targeting pro-Palestinian protesters. ‘There’s a genocide, and we need to be organizing against it’ While Saba was found responsible for violating the University of Wisconsin’s policies by a student-conduct investigating officer last August, her charges were dropped in October after she appealed them before a committee consisting of a student and university employees. Palestine Legal also sent her school a letter demanding that they end disciplinary proceedings against students in September, which assisted in Saba and another unnamed student’s charges being dropped. In a statement to the Guardian, University of Wisconsin-Madison spokesperson Kelly Tyrrell said that the school “does not disclose details related to individual student conduct cases”, and weighs each case based on a person’s conduct history and the circumstances surrounding the offense. She said the university seeks to create a campus “where all students feel supported, can pursue their educational goals without disruption, and are free to express themselves and engage across difference on complex topics, whether in their local community or around the world”. Despite the intimidation and disciplinary action that student protesters say they faced by their universities, they remain resolute in their fight to speak against their schools’ ties to Israel. Saba said she feels vindicated that her charges were dropped, though she thinks that the university’s system was flawed for finding her co-author, Ramachandran, culpable on the same limited evidence. Still, she holds onto hope that her school will eventually disclose its investments to the public and divest from companies that contribute to or profit from Israel’s war on Gaza. “This university, like many other universities, has lost its sense as a moral institution, an institution of ethics and an institution that aspires to do good in the world,” Saba said. “I want to see a university that actually responds to the demands of its students, rather than restricting their rights, and that prioritizes acting as a force of justice in the world, rather than just a machine that takes in money and spits out degrees.” Additional reporting by Adria R Walker This article was amended on 28 April 2025 to clarify that EK was let go from her school job. A previous version had said she was forbidden from campus housing.",US universities; Israel-Gaza war; US news; US politics; Students; Education; Higher education; Trump administration,US news
2023-11-25T10:00:46Z,King’s estate to transfer £100m into ethical funds after bona vacantia revelations,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/25/kings-estate-transfer-cash-ethical-funds-bona-vacantia-revelations,"King Charles’s estate has announced it is transferring more than £100m, including funds collected from dead people under the archaic system of bona vacantia, into ethical investment funds after an investigation by the Guardian. The surprise announcement came amid growing pressure on the king over the Duchy of Lancaster’s use of funds collected from people who die in the north-west of England with no will or next of kin. On Thursday, the Guardian revealed some of the funds were secretly being used to renovate properties that are owned by the king and rented out for profit by his estate. The duchy conceded that some bona vacantia revenues are financing the restoration of what it calls “public and historic properties”. However, the king’s estate has also been battling separate questions over its management of another portion of bona vacantia funds that are given to its charities. Two of those charities have used bona vacantia to build major endowment funds worth more than £40m. Their accounts state that there are “no specific constraints on the investment portfolio in terms of ethical, social or environmental (ESG) matters”, although investment managers are advised to take such matters “into consideration”. Contacted by the Guardian this week, the Duchy of Lancaster initially declined to say whether its charities had invested in any oil or gas, tobacco, weapons or mining companies. However late on Friday, a spokesperson for the estate announced a change in policy. “In line with the king’s longstanding support of ethical investing, the Duchy of Lancaster has begun the process of transferring its investment portfolio into ESG funds. This process is expected to be completed by the end of the financial year,” the spokesperson said. There been no suggestion from the king’s estate that it plans to cease collecting bona vacantia or change how it is spent. However, the shift in investment policy will bring the Duchy of Lancaster’s approach into line with that of the Duchy of Cornwall, another royal estate that receives bona vacantia funds, which has an ethical investment policy. The king previously owned and closely managed the Duchy of Cornwall, which raises profits for the heir to the throne. When Charles became king, it was inherited by his son Prince William. At the same time Charles inherited from his mother the Duchy of Lancaster, which exists to raise “private” income for the monarch. Both the duchy itself, and its charities, have investment portfolios. The duchy’s own portfolio, according to its accounts, include equities, bonds and other financial investments worth £74m. That too is now being transferred to ethical funds. The charities the duchy gives bona vacantia revenues to, the Duchy of Lancaster Benevolent Fund and Duchy of Lancaster Jubilee Trust, have also built large endowment funds, worth £18m and £26m respectively. Both charities’ accounts state they aim for an annual return of £500,000 from their investments, and benchmark the success of the bulk of their stock investments against the FTSE All-Share Index, an index that includes companies such as Shell, BP and British American Tobacco. Ben Faulkner, of the ethical investment company EQ Investors, said benchmarking against an index could mean replicating investments in the companies involved: “Using an index as a base for a replication strategy is very common, known widely as index tracking. When doing so you will typically have more invested in the biggest companies within the index you are tracking … Shell is the largest listed company within the FTSE All-Share Index.” In the last five years, the Duchy of Lancaster Benevolent Fund has made nearly £2m in income from its investment portfolio, while the Jubilee Trust has made £2.5m. The Duchy of Cornwall, which collects bona vacantia from Cornish residents, has a clear ethical policy in relation to investments by the Duke of Cornwall Benevolent Fund, which has built a £5m endowment. Its accounts state: “The fund is entirely invested in the Newton SRI Fund for Charities, a global and diversified portfolio of equities and fixed interest securities with particular emphasis on environmental, social and governance considerations, screened against negative socially responsible investment criteria.” The Duchy of Lancaster’s announcement of a similar policy comes amid growing questions for the royal estate which has long claimed that bona vacantia proceeds go to charity after costs are deducted. In a shift in language, it now concedes funds are additionally spent on “restoration and repair” of qualifying buildings on the estate. Leaked documents reveal properties deemed eligible for the funds include a suite of properties rented out to raise profit for the king, including holiday lets, farmhouses, a barn on a shooting range and a petrol station. The duchy collects bona vacantia assets from residents of the ancient county palatinate of Lancashire – a territory that includes Lancashire and parts of Merseyside, Cheshire and Cumbria. Cat Smith, MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood, said: “Like so many other local people I was surprised to learn the anomaly that means those dying without a will or heir in the county palatine see their assets passed to the king rather than the state. It’s an unjust and archaic hangover from the medieval times and I’ll be seeking advice on how to bring my constituents’ rights out of the feudal era.” Her comments come after criticisms from two mayors from the north-west of England. “This appears to be a bizarre remnant of feudal Britain,” said the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham. “At the very least, people in the north-west are owed transparency and accountability. They should also have a say on how these proceeds are used. I would call on the government and the Duchy of Lancaster to initiate a public consultation on this issue to work towards a set of arrangements that could command greater public consent.” Steve Rotheram, the mayor of the Liverpool city region, also expressed concern. “Worthy causes have been bypassed and instead it appears that funding has been spent renovating royal properties. I hope the situation will be clarified urgently and, if money has been misused, it is put back where it should be: with those charities it was promised to.”",King Charles III; Fossil fuels; Climate crisis; Energy; Environment; Monarchy; UK news; North of England; Lancashire,UK news
2024-05-06T17:42:28Z,Students stage pro-Palestine occupations at five more UK universities,https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/06/students-stage-pro-palestine-occupations-at-five-more-uk-universities,"Students at five UK universities have become the latest protesters to stage occupations to pressure their institutions into divesting funds from and ending partnerships with Israel. Students set up encampments at the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas) and at Oxford, Cambridge, Liverpool and Edinburgh universities. They are the latest in a global student uprising that is expected to build over the coming week across European campuses after starting at universities in the US, where hundreds of students and staff have been arrested for their involvement. A joint statement from the organisers Oxford Action for Palestine and Cambridge for Palestine read: “Over 100 universities across the globe have now taken bold and urgent action for Palestine. As members of these institutions, we refuse to accept our universities’ complicity in Israel’s war crimes against the Palestinian people – and we refuse to stand by while they justify Israel’s campaign of mass slaughter, starvation, and displacement.” The protesters at Oxford and Cambridge arrived on Monday morning with supplies, sleeping bags and cardboard signs bearing hand-painted slogans that stated: “There are no universities left in Gaza” and “Divest from genocide”. A large banner, reading “Welcome to the people’s university for Palestine”, was put up outside the encampment in front of the Pitt Rivers museum in Oxford. They have also demanded that Oxford and Cambridge universities divest from all companies linked to Israeli genocide and occupation, help rebuild Gaza’s education system, end institutional relationships with Israeli universities and protect the safety of students and staff involved in pro-Palestinian action. More than 170 Oxford faculty and staff members signed a letter in support of the encampment and its aims. Sneha Krishnan, an associate professor in human geography at the university, said it was “scandalous” that universities had not openly condemned Israel’s actions. “I strongly believe that students everywhere in the world are leading us in an important moral struggle at this moment,” she said. Ana, a second-year undergraduate involved in the encampment at Oxford, said there was an “optimistic” atmosphere, with students working on essays alongside attending workshops. “It’s time for more than protests that happen every two weeks,” she said. “It’s time for us to be here … in place until the university accepts our demands.” A third-year student at Oxford said the encampment would remain for “as long as it takes”, adding: “We have no fear of continuing to escalate until these demands are met.” At the encampment on King’s Parade, Cambridge, events included deescalation training for protesters, a rally and a dinner funded by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign. A crowdfunding campaign raised nearly £6,000 for the “vital supplies that will be necessary if our encampment is to be prolonged, persistent, and effective”. Other universities involved in action so far include University College London, Manchester, Newcastle, Sheffield, Leeds, Warwick, Swansea, Goldsmiths and Bristol in the UK; as well as Sciences Po in France, Trinity College Dublin, the University of Lausanne in Switzerland and the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. A final year student representative of Manchester Camp of Resistance for Palestine, said camps were “popping up all across the country”, including at Liverpool on Monday, with organisers sharing knowledge and experiences. “No camps have closed over the past few days,” she noted. Earlier in the week, Goldsmiths bowed to pressure from student occupiers and agreed to a new ethical investment policy, including considering switching fund manager; to write to the government urging it to call for a ceasefire; and to fund an undergraduate Palestinian scholarship. A University of Oxford spokesperson said: “We respect our students and staff members’ right to freedom of expression in the form of peaceful protests. We ask everyone who is taking part to do so with respect, courtesy and empathy.” A University of Cambridge spokesperson said: “The university is fully committed to academic freedom and freedom of speech within the law and we acknowledge the right to protest. We ask everyone in our community to treat each other with understanding and empathy. Our priority is the safety of all staff and students. “We will not tolerate antisemitism, Islamophobia and any other form of racial or religious hatred, or other unlawful activity.”",Israel-Gaza war; Universities; Gaza; Higher education; Israel; Students; Protest; UK news; Middle East and north Africa; World news,World news
2024-06-09T06:00:09Z,"Your sermons on integrity are a bit rich, archbishop, given your faith in Paula Vennells | Catherine Bennett",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/09/your-sermons-on-integrity-are-a-bit-rich-archbishop-given-your-faith-in-paula-vennells,"The archbishop of Canterbury moved with impressive speed when the general election was announced, to remind everyone to behave nicely. He urged people, “of all faiths and none”, to prioritise, above all, “good grace and a commitment to truth and integrity”. By some miracle, the election news had already constrained coverage of a potential disincentive to listening to the further exhortations of J Welby: the appearance at the Post Office inquiry of Rev Paula Vennells, the former Post Office CEO and Church of England adviser. Archbishop Justin, it is reported, once wanted this pious retweeter of his own insights to be bishop of London. True, Vennells didn’t get the bishop job, she “stood down” as a part-time curate and is no longer the church’s go-to governance authority, but while no Anglican archbishop would consider himself infallible, it can’t help when a favourite is exposed as contributing to untold injustice and misery. That’s if Vennells wasn’t more like a mentor. In the preface to his 2018 book, Reimagining Britain: Foundations for Hope (published after 555 postmasters had already launched legal action against the Post Office), Welby says she “shaped my thinking over the years”. It was odd, you might think, for a spiritual leader to pay tribute to a CEO whose theological scholarship, even if she was inspired by King Solomon, seems limited to a part-time course and volunteer officiating. But perhaps Welby’s Church of England is closer, spiritually, to L’Oreal, Unilever, Argos and other landmarks on the Vennells CV than the average non-believer can comprehend. By the end of her recent cross examination, any claim Vennells might once have had to Welby’s recommended “integrity” had, of course, been comprehensively trashed. Her “commitment to truth” didn’t look much better. Why had this ordained minister told the business select committee in 2015 that remote access to branch transactions was impossible? After reports and warnings stating the opposite? As for the “good grace” the archbishop urges us to cherish, the weepy Vennells would be reminded, among many inglorious episodes, of a “triumphalist” email from 2014. Following an item on The One Show about subpostmasters whose lives were devastated, Vennells said she had been “more bored than outraged”. Unfavourable content was dismissed as “hype and human interest”. Around that time the C of E could still, possibly, have organised some coherent-ish explanation for ignoring hundreds of postmasters whose claims the Post Office, of which Vennells was CEO, was fighting. But even after a high court judge ruled, in 2019, that there was a “material risk” shortfalls had been caused by the system, the church failed to grasp that less controversial business experts might be preferable, if only for appearance’s sake. Over a couple of years, the respective timelines of Vennells in the secular world and Vennells at the Church of England, indicate, on the one hand, only causes for concern, on the other, continuing approval. In 2019, she was invited on its Ethical Investment Advisory Group, in 2020, she joined the archbishops’ pandemic coordinating group, leading on governance; the Church Commissioners benefited too, from her “Lessons Learnt” commentary on a previous church buildings report. Reasons it failed, Vennells advised, included: “gaps in leadership and at times poor behaviours”. Imperial College NHS trust and Dunelm were also, inexcusably, recruiting her in 2019, the same year the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy successfully put her forward for a CBE. Grim. But Dunelm isn’t telling political leaders to volunteer. Imperial College NHS trust isn’t inviting the public, like the Church of England, to say daily pre-election prayers based on its edifying “thematic reflections”. Day two, Integrity: “it is right that citizens should expect integrity, honesty and humility of those who wield power over the lives of others”. Vennells returned her used CBE before it was formally removed, the Cabinet Office later announced, for “bringing the honours system into disrepute”. To date, the church has shown distinctly less interest than the UK’s already blighted honours system in separating its own reputation from that of Paula Vennells, who retains holy orders. Welby concedes only that “more questions should have been asked” before she was given a series of appointments after the Horizon scandal emerged, such that “we will need to reflect on it”. If Lessons have indeed been Learnt, there is little outward sign. Some clerics expect more. One, after the disclosure that Welby favoured Vennells for bishop of London, the C of E’s third most senior role, called for his resignation. Another has tabled a private member’s motion for Synod’s consideration (if it gets the required support): “That this Synod, in the light of the central role of Paula Vennells in the Post Office Horizon scandal, and the comment by the archbishop of Canterbury that ‘Paula Vennells has shaped my thinking over the years’, request that a full review be undertaken of the influence of Paula Vennells on the culture, decisions, appointments, and strategies of the House of Bishops and the wider church.” As much as a non-congregant is probably disqualified from debating managerial as opposed to theological approaches to running an established church, it seems reasonable for religious outsiders to expect some explanation for his apparent misjudgment from Welby the House of Lords member, moral figurehead and busy, if unelected, politician. A recent Spectator interview was headlined: “Justin Welby: why shouldn’t bishops be political?” It looks like we may have an answer. That his recent contributions on Rwanda and the benefit cap have appeared enlightened, only makes seeming sustained indifference to a massive miscarriage of justice more incomprehensible. The association with Vennells continued long after the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance said it was “stunned” by her CBE, awarded after the Post Office had “brought so much suffering”. To be fair, numerous businesses were likewise unconcerned. Maybe, as the testimony of Paula Vennells has already indicated, we just expect too much virtue from prominent clergy.

2024-05-04T16:00:33Z,‘I feel disgusted and ashamed’: Bristol student camp one of many protesting at university ties to Israel,https://www.theguardian.com/education/article/2024/may/04/i-feel-disgusted-and-ashamed-bristol-student-camp-one-of-many-protesting-at-university-ties-to-israel,"The collection of 12 tents pitched in a soggy garden at the heart of Bristol university’s campus is on a much smaller scale than the Palestine solidarity encampments sweeping the US. But the outrage at what this new generation of student activists regard as the complicity of education institutions in Israel’s assault on Gaza is just as raw. “It makes me feel sick to my stomach,” said Olivia [not her real name], a second-year student at the university, outside the camp on Friday. “I feel deeply disgusted and ashamed. This protest is absolutely the least I can do for someone studying at a university that is so complicit.” Like many of the students involved in the protest, she doesn’t want to share her name. “There could be academic repercussions [for students taking part]: anything from being banned from university buildings to suspensions and expulsions,” she said. “This has happened in the UK, but not at this university so far.” At least seven similar encampments have sprung up at British universities in the past week, including Warwick, the first to pitch tents, Newcastle, Sheffield, and a “village” in Manchester, where there are more than 50 tents. All are demanding universities cut ties with companies activists claim are arming Israel. The campus protests come after a string of occupations of university buildings. Goldsmiths senior management on Friday agreed to offer scholarships to Palestinian students and will review the university’s ethical investment policy after a five-week occupation by students. The mood on British campuses remains very different from that of American universities, where officers have broken up protest camps and arrested more than 2,000 activists. The Bristol camp is opposite the university’s security services office but there is almost no security presence. “The university asked us to leave [on 2 May] but they haven’t made any other threats,” said Olivia. “The police came to look but they haven’t spoken to us.” However, the leader of the Commons, Penny Mordaunt, and Rishi Sunak’s official spokesperson have both indicated they would support action to quell disorder or harassment. Mordaunt said UK protesters should be met with an “extremely strict response” if they copied US campus tactics, which she claimed were violent. This worries some Bristol university staff backing the camp. Prof Colin Davis, who dropped by on Friday to support the students, claims the government is stoking conflict. “[Mordaunt] called on universities to respond to these protests severely. This could lead to the kinds of scenes we’ve seen in Columbia and UCLA replicated here, which is just appalling.” Davis backs the main demand of the camp. “It is feasible that research that goes on at this university helps make the weapons that are dropped on people in Gaza … it is deeply shameful.” Bristol university has longstanding links to BAE Systems, which has four sites in Bristol, including collaborating on research projects. A report by the Campaign Against Arms Trade claims BAE Systems partially manufactures F35 fighter planes, which have been used by the Israeli military in Gaza. Jewish students have expressed alarm at the rising levels of antisemitism they face. Last week, Edward Isaacs, president of the Union of Jewish Students, wrote in the Jewish Chronicle that “as Jewish students muster the resilience to begin sitting their end-of-year exams, campuses take another step forward in increased toxicity towards [them]”. He added that, although the UK was not seeing the same scenes as the US, “the rhetoric emanating from these [UK] encampments is increasing in hostility”. Isaacs called on universities to do more to stand with Jewish students: “Time and again, since 7 October, universities have been unwilling to effectively stand in allyship with their Jewish students and ensure they can be fully included in campus life. “Now is a bellwether moment for university administrations as to whether they will muster the moral courage to stand in allyship with Jewish students, and ensure campuses are places where they can study free from hatred.” The Bristol students deny claims that Gaza solidarity encampments create a toxic and hostile atmosphere for Jewish students. The organisers pointed out that some of the campers are Jewish. “We are not here to make Jewish students feel unsafe,” said . “We are here protesting the university’s complicity in the war machine that is providing Israel with the weapons to commit atrocities.” Phoebe, who has spent two nights in the camp, said she felt she had to take action: “There is an unprecedented amount of insight into this genocide. It is harrowing. I’ve cried watching videos [from Gaza]. I don’t think I would like myself if I was doing nothing about it.” The camp has been inundated with donations from other students, university staff and locals. There are bags filled with food and drinks under a gazebo, where a huddle of students are sheltering from the drizzle. Some well-wishers have brought hot food, including a bean chilli and soup. One lecturer arrives carrying bags of cutlery, bedding and books to read. “These students are doing something historic,” says a lecturer who wished to remain anonymous. “Not since the South Africa anti-apartheid movement has there been a global student movement that has demanded divestment from a settler colonial state.” On Friday, a rally of about 100 students and staff gathered nearby to demonstrate support for the encampment. Dr Eldin Fahmy, a lecturer, said: “We are all inspired by events we are seeing in the United States. The resistance of students [there] has been magnificent.” Paolo Gerbaudo, an academic at King’s College London, who studies social movements, suggested: “The US has a far heavier footprint in terms of its support for Israel, hence US students feel a stronger burden of responsibility for what is happening in Gaza.” A University of Bristol spokesperson said: “We fully respect the rights of our students to peacefully protest within the law. We recognise the distress and impact on all staff and students at the university of the ongoing conflict in Israel-Gaza. It is more important than ever that we sustain our shared values of mutual respect, support and compassion for each other, whatever our individual views.” BAE Systems said it operated under the tightest regulation and complied fully with all applicable defence export controls: “The ongoing violence in the Middle East is having a devastating impact on civilians in the region and we hope the parties involved find a way to end the violence as soon as possible. We respect everyone’s right to protest peacefully.”",Universities; Israel-Gaza war; UK news; Student experience; Protest; University of Bristol; Higher education,Education
2021-10-12T15:15:05Z,Prince Harry and Meghan recruited by US ethical investment firm,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/12/prince-harry-and-meghan-recruited-by-us-ethical-investment-firm,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have added to their portfolio of jobs since stepping down as working members of the royal family last year, joining a US ethical money manager as “impact partners”. Prince Harry and Meghan said they hoped their partnership with Ethic, which has $1.3bn of assets under management, would encourage more younger people to invest their money in sustainable companies. “When we invest in each other we change the world,” the couple said in a statement. “Our choices – of how and where we put our energy – define us as a global community. “We believe it’s time for more people to have a seat at the table when decisions are made that impact everyone. We want to rethink the nature of investing to help solve the global issues we all face. This is one of the ways we put our values in action.” Ethic, which was founded in 2015, claims to only invest in “companies that treat people and the planet with respect”. The Sussexes have investments managed by Ethic and also invested directly in the fund manager earlier this year. “Now they want to shine a light on how we can all impact the causes that affect our communities, bring transparency into how the corporate world sets the tone and shapes outcomes for everyday families, and believe that more people should have a seat at the table when it comes to making progress,” the company said in a press release. Ethic did not disclose how much the pair would be paid for their advice. In an interview with the New York Times, which first reported the partnership on Tuesday, Meghan said: “My husband has been saying for years, ‘Gosh, don’t you wish there was a place where if your values were aligned like this, you could put your money to that same sort of thing?’” Harry said he suspected young people in future would demand their money was invested in ethical companies. “You already have the younger generation voting with their dollars and their pounds, you know, all over the world when it comes to brands they select and choose from,” he said. Ethic’s existing investors include Ashton Kutcher’s Sound Ventures and the investment fund Fidelity Investments. The appointment is the latest in a long list of jobs the couple have taken on since stepping down as senior royals and moving to Los Angeles. In March, Harry was appointed “chief impact officer” at BetterUp, a Silicon Valley startup that provides professional coaching, mental health advice and “immersive learning”. The company, which promises to deliver users of its mobile app “an all-round better life”, last week raised $300m in venture capital funding that valued the company at almost $5bn (£3.7bn), up from about $1bn when Harry joined in March. The Sussexes have also signed multimillion-dollar deals to provide content for Netflix and Spotify. Their contract with Netflix, which is reportedly worth up to $122m, was to create “content that informs but also gives hope”. Meghan is working with David Furnish on a Netflix animation series that “centres on the adventures of a 12-year-old girl who is inspired by a variety of influential women from history”. Harry is helping with the production of Heart of Invictus, a documentary that will follow competitors preparing to compete in the 2022 edition of his charity event for injured or sick armed service personnel. For Spotify, the couple have produced a 30-minute podcast in which famous people talk about how they coped during lockdowns.","Prince Harry; Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex; Monarchy; US news; UK news; World news; Environment; Investing; Business",UK news
2024-01-09T17:56:31Z,How Horizon IT scandal brought down former Post Office boss Paula Vennells,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/09/post-office-horizon-it-scandal-paula-vennells-cbe,"The decision by the former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells to hand back her CBE marks an ignominious end to a career that will be remembered for her organisation’s relentless run of wrongful prosecutions against more than 900 post office operators. Last year, Alan Bates, the operator who led the campaign to expose the Horizon IT scandal and whose story has now been told in an ITV drama, turned down an OBE, making the point that it would be “inappropriate” while victims still suffered and Vennells retained her accolade. She was awarded her CBE for services to the Post Office and charity at the start of 2019, shortly before she stepped down – ending a seven-year period as chief executive during which she collected more than £4.5m in pay. About £2.2m of those earnings were performance-related bonuses, mostly linked to a strategic plan to make the business sustainably profitable, and amassed while many of those the Post Office was pursuing were being made bankrupt and suffering unfathomable personal ordeals. Vennells’ exit came just before a damning high court judgment ruled that the Horizon accounting system used by post office operators was not “remotely robust”, had “bugs, errors and defects”, and that there was a “material risk” it had caused shortfalls in branch accounts. In December that year, 10 months after Vennells’ departure, the Post Office agreed to settle with 555 claimants to end a long-running series of cases over the Fujitsu-developed IT system, admitting it “got things wrong”. This marked the first turning point for victims. The Conservative peer James Arbuthnot has described the Post Office’s actions under Vennells’ tenure as “cruel and incompetent”. Vennells, a former parish priest, joined the Post Office in 2007 as a network director, having held marketing roles at Dixons, Argos and Whitbread, and two years later became involved in developing the defence of Horizon. This was a time when questions were being raised about the system by a campaign led by a small group of MPs, the then-fledgling Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance set up by Bates, and Computer Weekly, which published the first media investigation of the issues. In 2009, Vennells sent a company-wide “Horizon defence piece” email containing a “written rebuttal and position that the business was adopting”. This was the start of an aggressive pushback by bosses in the face of evidence the software had faults. In 2012, when Vennells was promoted to chief executive, an external review of Horizon was carried out by the forensic accountancy firm Second Sight. Its interim report found evidence of flaws and bugs. On two occasions, “defects” in the system had resulted in a shortfall of about £9,000 at 76 branches. Second Sight’s final report described the Horizon system as “not fit for purpose” in some cases, and said it experienced 12,000 communication failures a year. The report’s authors warned of “potential miscarriages of justice and misconduct by prosecutors acting on behalf of the Post Office”. The Post Office maintained there was “absolutely no evidence of any systemic issues with the computer system”. As the scale of the miscarriage of justice has become increasingly apparent – and public – Vennells’ career since stepping down as chief executive has cratered. Shortly after her departure she took up a post as the chair of Imperial College healthcare NHS trust, which runs several London hospitals; was appointed as a non-executive director at the Cabinet Office; joined the board of the furniture firm Dunelm, and retained a seat in the boardroom at the supermarket chain Morrisons. She has since quit all those roles, leaving Morrisons and Dunelm in 2021 just days after the court of appeal quashed the convictions of 39 post office operators, saying the Post Office knew there were faults in Horizon. At the same time, she announced she was stepping back from her duties as a minister at the Church of St Owen, near Bedford, in the diocese of St Albans, because of the “distraction” of the scandal. She also stopped being a member of the Church of England’s ethical investment advisory group.",Post Office Horizon scandal; Post Office; Business; UK news,UK news
2021-11-23T05:23:50Z,Ethical investment funds urge WA premier to shelve new Aboriginal heritage laws,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/23/ethical-investment-funds-urge-wa-premier-to-shelve-new-aboriginal-heritage-laws,"A coalition of ethical investment funds have urged the Western Australian government to delay the passage of new Aboriginal heritage laws, which significant traditional owner groups say fail to provide the protections necessary to prevent another disaster like the destruction of Juukan Gorge. It comes as the state’s biggest land council has joined other Indigenous groups in requesting United Nations intervention to prevent the passage of the laws. Future Super, ex-local government fund Vision Super, Australian Ethical Investment, Verve Super and Cruelty Free Super are among 14 investment funds to sign an open letter calling for the Mark McGowan government to shelve the bill until it can be revised to represent the interests of traditional owners. It follows criticism of the proposed laws by the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors and others, which said poor engagement with First Nations people and a lack of cultural heritage protection represent “material financial risks” for investors. Traditional owners have complained for three years that they have not been properly consulted on the bill, and have requested in public submissions that it be redrawn or scrapped. The investors, which represent a combined $461m in assets under management, are calling on the government to restore the right of traditional owners to appeal ministerial decisions. A draft of the bill released by then Aboriginal affairs minister Ben Wyatt in September last year allowed for traditional owners to appeal ministerial decisions to the State Administrative Tribunal. But the revised version significantly limits the scope for independent appeal and gives the minister, currently Stephen Dawson, final say. Investors said they were “very concerned and disappointed that local Indigenous groups were not suitably involved in the writing of the bill”. “To ensure that the heritage protection laws provide the level of security required to avoid a repeat of the events at Juukan Gorge, we believe the perspectives and knowledge of Indigenous peoples must be included in the formation of a new edition of the Bill,” the open letter said. “Aboriginal heritage is world heritage with inherent value and First Nations have inalienable rights to self-determination, to access their land, and to determine how to manage it.” The legislation was tabled last Tuesday and, given the McGowan government’s overwhelming majority, is expected to pass the lower house this week. On Friday the Kimberley Land Council (KLC) wrote to the UN special rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous Peoples, Francisco Cali-Tzay, requesting “urgent attention to intervene” in the passing of the proposed legislation. It also put its weight behind a request made by the Aboriginal Heritage Alliance that the laws be reviewed by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning That group, which includes Noongar academic Dr Hannah McGlade, wrote to the committee seeking a review in September. They wrote to the UN again last week seeking immediate assistance The West Australian campaign also has the support of the International Indian Treaty Council, which represents indigenous peoples from the Americas, the Caribbean and the Pacific. KLC chairman Anthony Watson said in his letter to Cali-Tzay that the legislation as written will not protect cultural heritage and “will continue a pattern of systemic structural racial discrimination against Aboriginal people”. CEO Tyronne Garstone said the land council decided to write to the UN “because the McGowan Government will not accept that the Bill in is in direct violation of our human rights”. “The McGowan Government is rushing through a Bill that Aboriginal people do not support,” he said. “We have not had our fundamental concerns addressed over the past three years during a severely flawed consultation process.”",Western Australia; Australia news; Indigenous Australians; Heritage; Mark McGowan,Australia news
2022-02-20T16:30:08Z,From human rights to recycling bins: how can you define ‘ethical investing’?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/21/from-human-rights-to-recycling-bins-how-can-you-define-ethical-investing,"Companies are facing increasing consumer and shareholder pressure to ensure the investments they make are ethical. But how do they define what’s ethical? Broadly, ethical investment is on the rise. According to the Responsible Investment Association Australasia (RIAA), about $1tn of the $2.24tn in managed funds is classified as responsible. That’s not just because Australians are becoming more aware of the impact their investments can have, but also because responsible or ethical investment is really starting to pay. Sustainable, environmentally friendly and socially conscious businesses are often making essential contributions to our future. Through superannuation, banking and shares, people are actively putting their funds into such ventures. Unfortunately, there’s no uniform indication of what constitutes “ethical”. There’s also no regulation to clarify what ethical investing is as a basic standard. So you need to navigate the marketing. Ethical screening is generally conducted by fund managers and financial advisers. So, for example, in the case of an ethical superannuation fund, the fund’s managers will establish their ethical expectations and screen prospective companies based on this. Similarly, an ethical financial adviser will have a broad view of what they deem ethical, while also taking their clients’ specific needs into account. If you are investing independently, it will be up to you to decide what’s non-negotiable and what’s acceptable. To give you an idea of how the big superannuation funds and ethical investment firms decide what’s ethical and what’s not, here’s a list of the ways their investments might be screened. It’s still not foolproof, but it’s a start. Negative screening The negative screening process involves putting companies through assessments to find out if they’re invested in things that people broadly deem unethical. If they produce an addictive product or service (tobacco, gambling), they’re unlikely to get over the ethical hurdle. Likewise, if they engage in poor labour practices, they can be struck off the list of potential investment. Negative screening is a good place to start when deciding what you will and won’t invest in. If you are staunchly opposed to tobacco, obviously you won’t want your investment portfolio to include a company that makes cigarettes. Positive or ‘best-in-class’ screening This involves seeking out companies that have good social and ethical values, such as a zero-carbon-emissions policy, a gender-diverse board and exemplary treatment of staff in the production of goods and services. In essence, they turn a profit by doing the right thing. Ideally, they do everything right, but depending on who’s screening, they might only need to meet one or a handful of items in the criteria to make the cut. Companies that perform well in a positive screening process often make a tangible difference to environmental or social outcomes. And, in a perfect world, they’re a good investment too. This might include sectors such as healthcare, education and renewable energy. All super funds, managed funds and exchange-traded fund managers will do a form of screening, but the screens vary and therefore you may also need to apply your own ethical lens to see if it’s a good fit. Minimum standards or ‘norms-based’ screening This approach uses the minimum standard of company, government or international standards. The minimum standards depend on which filter they’re put through. So, for example, they may be subject to assessment based on the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact. These principles are based, in part, on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The principles cover topics such as: • Human rights (non-compliance in human rights abuses) • Labour (recognition of the right to collective bargaining and elimination of compulsory labour and child labour; elimination of discrimination) • The environment (precautionary approaches to environmental concerns, environmental responsibility and the development of environmentally friendly technologies) • Anti-corruption Depending on the fund, or financial product, specific screens will be applied. For example, Verve Superannuation applies a specific gender equality screening. This might be important to you. Alternatively, if you seek vegan and animal-friendly investments, you’d be looking for a specific screen layer. Ethics are personal, and therefore no one broad screen is likely to fit your ethical goals. Sustainability investing This is a specific environmental approach, and it means actively seeking out funds or investment opportunities in clean-water programs, renewable energy, infrastructure, recycling, waste management and more. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing ESG covers environmental, social and governance screening principles. If this is the screen you’re using, you might need to dig a bit to see just how good a company’s governance is. That can mean a fair amount of time and effort on your part: reading company reports, understanding the financial situation and continuing to keep track of the company’s activity once you’ve invested. Because ESG covers these sweeping, general areas, it makes it possible for businesses to claim they’re meeting the ESG criteria when, in fact, it’s a regular business where people are paid the nominated award wages and there’s a recycling bin next to the printer. Perhaps they report on sustainability during their annual general meeting, but potentially there’s little real change being driven. That’s not to say there aren’t companies with a great commitment to ESG, but you need to be comfortable with where they sit on what is a massive spectrum. Impact investing If you choose impact investing as a key screen, you’re ultimately looking to see physical results from your investment. That might come in the form of improved transport and infrastructure, schools or hospitals. Equally, the impact might be improved social outcomes locally or internationally. Either way, you’ll seek to get a return on investment while hopefully being able to see an actual result. If you’re unsure where to start, an ethical financial adviser could help you establish a strategy. The cost of personal advice can be prohibitive, which means you may have to do your own research. The first step might be to call your superannuation fund and find out where your money is invested. If they can’t tell you, look for funds that can provide more transparency, so you can consider the contents of the portfolios and how they align with your values.

2022-10-27T09:00:25Z,100 UK universities pledge to divest from fossil fuels,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/oct/27/uk-universities-divest-fossil-fuels,"One hundred universities in the UK have pledged to divest from fossil fuels, the Guardian can reveal. This equates to 65% of the country’s higher education sector refusing to make at least some investments in fossil fuel companies, and endowments worth more than £17.6bn now out of reach for the corporations. This huge sum is mostly owing to the significant investment portfolios of the University of Edinburgh, as well as the universities of Oxford and Cambridge and their constituent colleges, all of which have at least partially divested. Coventry University has become the 100th, and on Thursday announces its divestment of a £43.6m investment portfolio from all fossil fuel companies after a nine-month student campaign. Riz Dhanani, the treasury manager at the university said: “Coventry University has been actively developing its ethical investment framework over the last few years with regular consultation and input from staff and students. “We are now proud to take our sustainability agenda one step further in the investment arena by committing to exclude fossil fuel extractor companies from our investments, something that we were already engaged in with our ethical fund managers but have now formally incorporated into our treasury and investment policy. “We will continue to invest in sustainable funds that strive to deliver better outcomes for society through their investments and I hope that making our pledge will encourage other institutions to follow suit.” The Fossil Free campaign, active since 2013, has been led by students, who say it should not be acceptable for education and research institutions to invest in companies responsible for global heating. Students have undertaken a range of campaign methods, from petitions gathering thousands of signatories, lobbying university management, political education and non-violent direct action, including occupying university buildings. The first institution to announce its was divesting was the University of Glasgow, in 2014. Now most UK universities have publicly said they will not fund fossil fuels. The campaign will pressure the remaining 53 universities to divest. Laura Clayson, a campaign manager at People and Planet, said: “It is always incredible to witness a university reject the fossil fuel industry, but especially so when it follows the work of phenomenal student organisers and brings us to such a milestone announcement. This is a win for all of those who have organised against the fossil fuel industry’s business model of deception, dispossession and destruction.”",Universities; Education; Higher education; Sustainability; Fossil fuel divestment; Environment; Fossil fuels; Energy; Oil and gas companies; Oil; Oil; Gas; Gas; Energy industry; Commodities; Business; Greenhouse gas emissions; Climate crisis; People & Planet Green League,Education
2023-03-12T19:53:50Z,Australian Ethical offloads Lendlease shares over development threat to koala population,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/13/australian-ethical-offloads-lendlease-shares-over-development-threat-to-koala-population,"One of Australia’s leading ethical investment managers says it has sold its shares in Lendlease over concerns a planned housing development in south-west Sydney threatens the survival of Sydney’s largest healthy koala population. Australian Ethical has divested $11m in shareholdings in the property developer’s listed assets, saying Lendlease had failed to provide “critical information” about the width of planned koala corridors at stage two of its Gilead housing development. The investment manager said it believed it was one of the first funds managers in Australia to divest from a company because of concern for an endangered species. The development proposes more than 3,000 additional houses in the Campbelltown local government area, which includes habitat for koalas. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup A proposal for the project was publicly exhibited in December, and Australian Ethical and environmental campaigners have raised concern it contained insufficient information about the specific dimensions of nature corridors that would be retained for koalas. The environment and heritage group within the New South Wales Department of Planning and Environment raised similar issues, writing in public submissions that insufficient information had been provided about biodiversity. It also wrote it considered the proposal to be “inconsistent with the advice and recommendations contained in the Office of Chief Scientist and Engineer (OCSE) advice on the protection of the Campbelltown koalas”. The OCSE’s advice recommended an average koala corridor width of 390m to 425m, and the method used for calculating that average included a minimum width of 250m. Australian Ethical is concerned the NSW planning and environment department and Lendlease have interpreted the advice in a way that is favourable for development and dangerous for koalas by making the habitat too narrow for the koalas to move through and survive. The funds manager said it had lost faith after recent talks with Lendlease “stalled”, and the planning and environment department had failed to commit to “meaningful public consultation” ahead of a July deadline for a decision on whether to approve the development. Australian Ethical sold its debt and equity positions in Lendlease last week. It still has an investment in an unlisted property trust – the Australian Prime Property Fund Retail – which is illiquid and managed by Lendlease but said it would exit as soon as it was able. “For over four years we have used our shareholdings in Lendlease to encourage it to strengthen koala protections, but Australian Ethical cannot continue to support a company that appears to be failing to take biodiversity protection seriously,” Australian Ethical spokesperson Amanda Richman said. “We’ve been clear that Australian Ethical would continue to advocate until we have exhausted all avenues with Lendlease to improve koala protections, and we’ve now reached that point.” She said Australian Ethical was calling on the NSW environment minister, James Griffin, to intervene and ensure there was transparent public consultation because “we cannot be confident that this koala colony will survive the developments proposed for the area”. “Neither Lendlease or the NSW Department of Planning and Environment have given the public meaningful information about the proposed koala corridors at Mt Gilead, and we have serious concerns about the way the reports from the NSW chief scientist and other experts are being interpreted by the department,” she said. Stuart Blanch, a conservation scientist with WWF-Australia, welcomed Australian Ethical’s decision and hoped other financial institutions would take note and “commit to divesting from corporations who are destroying nature”. “We’re familiar with banks divesting from coal, oil and gas, but Australian Ethical has made a stand to protect nature,” he said. Australian Ethical’s decision follows recent concerns raised about the planned expansion of other housing developments in western and south-western Sydney, including in areas that received fast-tracked land rezonings. Environment campaigners and scientists have also questioned whether these proposed developments adequately protect koalas and endangered ecosystems. A spokesperson for Lendlease said the company had engaged with Australian Ethical for several years and that its plans “fully adhere to the independent and expert recommendations of the NSW chief scientist”. “Our $35m investment into conservation at Gilead includes creating koala corridors that have been independently assessed as meeting the recommendations of the chief scientist in terms of width and connectivity.” A spokesperson for the planning and environment department said “transparency has and always will be an important part of our assessment processes”. They said Lendlease’s proposal included maps identifying the location of proposed koala corridors, and those maps, as well as the chief scientist’s advice, were publicly available. They said the department’s environment and heritage group took part in a technical assurance program “which ensured the draft proposal met the advice of the chief scientist and engineer”. A spokesperson for NSW planning minister, Anthony Roberts, said the specifications for the koala corridors “will be further refined as the draft proposal for Stage 2 progresses through the planning process”. “This is the only way to enable timely delivery of koala underpasses along Appin Road that are consistent with the chief scientist’s recommendations.” The spokesperson said the Coalition, if re-elected this month, remained committed to doubling the state’s koala populations by 2050.

2022-10-04T06:00:27Z,Green your pension: how you can help the environment,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/oct/04/green-pension-help-environment-climate-crisis,"UK pension funds are worth approximately £3tn with this huge wealth invested in assets all over the world. If you are eager to reduce your carbon footprint, making your pension “green” is 21 times more effective than giving up flying, becoming a vegetarian and changing an energy provider combined, according to the campaign group Make My Money Matter. So how can you make your pension better for the planet? What is ‘more green’ to you? Romi Savova, the chief executive of the pensions consolidator firm PensionBee, says the question you need to ask yourself is: “What does being more green mean to you?” She says: “Because the way it is expressed in the pensions industry can be very, very different, depending on the pension plan and provider.” When looking at whether your pension aligns with your values, one thing to consider is what your approach will be. “Are you looking for investments that exclude companies which contribute to environmental challenges, or do you want to be invested in a way that engages with these companies to push them to do better?” says Helen Morrissey, the senior pensions and retirement analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “Engagement,” Savova says, “means you continue to invest in companies that may be major fossil fuel producers, for example. “But your asset manager, or pension provider, takes an active role in engaging with those companies, to encourage them to reform, over time, and put themselves on a more sustainable trajectory for the future.” Stakeholder engagement, with the threat of divestment, is powerful, says David Macdonald, the founder of the independent financial advisers Path Financial. “If you’re an active shareholder, you’re challenging them constantly to improve standards, to make faster changes, to have more credible pledges – with the threat of divestment if they don’t,” he says. “So moving the money into a fund which takes its stakeholder responsibility seriously, and drives for the change that it’s talking about, is far more impactful than just investing in those companies passively in, say, a tracker, where nobody gives a damn about what the companies are actually doing. “If people want their invested money to have a voice, then it’s got to be somewhere where the voice can be heard. And that comes through a more active approach to being a stakeholder,” Macdonald adds. Beyond these choices, you move into actually trying to direct your money to do something genuinely positive, Savova says. “You would be making sure that money goes into renewable energy, healthcare, social bonds, as opposed to, say, government bonds.” Check a workplace pension “Your provider should be able to help you find out where it invests, and, if you already have an online account, you should be able to get details of what your pension is invested in,” Morrissey says. However, she adds: “It can be difficult to drill down and get all the data you need – you may only get the top 10 holdings, for instance, or you may find your funds are invested in other funds so you can’t immediately get the detail needed.” If you are not happy with what you find, Morrissey suggests asking your provider if they have any other funds you can switch to, that are more suitable. “Don’t just accept the default that you’re given; poke around a little bit and see what the options are,” Macdonald says. “The provider might have an ethical fund, or an environmental, social and governance (ESG) choice, which is better than the default.” It is worth noting, too, that ESG is a broad term, open to interpretation and, by unfortunate extension, greenwashing. “As responsible investing has become more high profile, it has led some managers to overstate the progress they are making in incorporating ESG factors into their strategies,” Morrissey says. “Before deciding to invest, it’s worth checking to see if they have signed up to any industry initiatives such as the UN-backed ‘principles for responsible investment’. “Managers have to commit to invest responsibly, as well as incorporate ESG issues into their investment analysis and decision-making processes,” she says. “Many will also issue responsible investment reports, which you can find on their websites.” Put pressure on providers Crucially, if you are in a workplace pension, the provider will have been chosen by your employer. Simply stopping paying into that pension, and opening a new one, would mean you would lose your employer contribution. You could, instead, put pressure on pension providers from “within” to encourage them to change their investing ways. If your workplace provider doesn’t offer a fund that matches your environmental values – or even anything approaching them – Make My Money Matter has a tool on its website that allows you to select your provider and send a pre-written letter asking it to offer green pension funds. “Within the sector, we have had feedback from pension funds saying that people emailing them has actually made a difference,” says Kenneth Green, the campaigns manager at Make My Money Matter. “We have managed to help get £1.3tn in UK pension funds committed to net zero.” Transfer old pensions “A lot of people will have old pensions they’ve left behind when they’ve moved on from various jobs,” Savova says. “In the vast majority, those pensions will be invested in so-called default funds, which are chosen by the employer. And the vast majority of those will have exposure to fossil fuels, including producers like Shell and BP. “It can be a bit of a surprise to savers, who have often gone the extra mile in making their daily habits greener, to find their pension is invested directly in fossil fuels.” If you are no longer happy with the way those funds are invested, you can make changes. “Once you’ve figured out where your current pensions are invested, you can decide what to do with them,” Savova says. “Often that will mean consolidating them into a new online plan.” It is possible to do this yourself but there are a number of consolidation firms that transfer pensions into one place; some, such as PensionBee, have fossil fuel-free plans. Compare any changes carefully, and be sure there will not be negative consequences, Morrissey says: “Before deciding to transfer, it is worth checking that you won’t miss out on any potential benefits, such as guaranteed annuity rates, or incur any exit penalties.” Before making any decisions about pensions, it is wise to take professional advice. You can find a list of independent financial advisers specialising in ethical investment on the Ethical Investment Association website. Compare and contrast “Your pension is built for your retirement. It’s built for your future. You don’t want to put it in something that could be inherently risky,” Savova says. There is, of course, always a risk in investing. But how do green funds compare with those that don’t use sustainability criteria? According to Morningstar, across six different categories of fund and over a five-year period, sustainable funds consistently outperformed their standard counterparts by between 0.54 and 1.91%.",Money; Consumer affairs; Pensions; Ethical money; Environment; Green economy; Green politics; Investments; Investment funds; Ethical and green living; UK news,Money

Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert’s manic multiverse fantasy has dominated this year’s Oscars, winning best picture and six other awards, including for Michelle Yeoh, who became the first south-east Asian performer to win the best actress award. The most nominated film of the night also won best director, best supporting actor, best supporting actress, best editing and best original screenplay at the 95th Academy Awards ceremony. With Ke Huy Quan’s win for best supporting actor it was the first time multiple Asian actors won Oscars in the same year. In her acceptance speech, Yeoh called her win “a beacon of hope and possibility” for “all the little boys and girls who look like me watching tonight”. The ceremony began with host Jimmy Kimmel roasting Will Smith and ended with a screen showing the words: “Number of Oscars telecasts without incident: 001.” Here is the full list of winners, and you can look back at our blog to relive the action, including gems such as the Guardian’s Stuart Heritage declaring the night’s most viral moment – that time Hugh Grant compared his face to a scrotum. Top news Ralph Babet | The United Australia party senator has defended continuing to work for his family real estate business by claiming he is not paid. Babet said his job in the Senate still “takes priority” but that he was likely to return to real estate after one term in parliament because he did not see himself as a “career politician”. NSW politics | Premier Dominic Perrottet has denied removing senior minister Victor Dominello from the state’s gambling portfolio due to pressure from the powerful clubs lobby, saying he was “never under pressure” over the decision. Concern over lead testing | Community-led rainwater testing near the NSW town of Orange has found that one in three tanks have unsafe lead levels, which residents are concerned is linked to the Cadia goldmine. NSW Health is now retesting water samples to determine if there is a broader public health risk. Australian Ethical divests over koala concerns | One of Australia’s leading ethical investment managers says it has sold its shares in Lendlease over concerns a planned housing development in south-west Sydney threatens the survival of Sydney’s largest healthy koala population. Aukus | The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has declared “a new dawn for Australia’s defence policy” as he prepares to announce the Aukus nuclear-powered submarine plan tomorrow alongside Joe Biden and Rishi Sunak. Guardian Australia’s defence correspondent, Daniel Hurst, takes a look at the remaining unanswered questions. Plus, Prof John Blaxland on why Aukus will bolster stability in the Asia-Pacific, not undermine it. China | Xi Jinping has vowed to oppose Taiwan independence in his closing speech at the National People’s Congress, after a week in which the country’s rubber-stamp parliament handed China’s president an unprecedented third presidential term. He also called for greater economic self-reliance and the peaceful development of cross-strait relations with Taiwan. North Korea | The nuclear-armed country test-fired two strategic cruise missiles from a submarine on Sunday, its state news agency KCNA reported, just as the US and South Korea were due to kick off their largest joint military exercise in five years. US banking | US financial regulators rolled out emergency measures on Sunday night to stem potential contagion from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, including guaranteeing all deposits with the failed bank. Its collapse has shaken a tech sector already facing difficulties including unprecedented layoffs. Extreme weather | Another “atmospheric river” storm was expected to hit California on Monday, after thousands of residents were left without power following a weekend of heavy rainfall, powerful floods and deadly destruction. At least two people were killed by the recent storms while 9,400 were placed under evacuation orders. Full Story The teals, farmers and traditional owners fighting Santos The rich farmlands of NSW’s Liverpool Plains have long been coveted by fossil fuel companies – BHP and Chinese state-owned Shenhua have both tried and walked away. Now locals are preparing to fight Australian gas giant Santos, which holds the licences for what lies beneath. Rural and regional editor Gabrielle Chan tells Jane Lee about the new generation of farmers taking on Santos, alongside traditional owners and teal independent MPs.

2021-12-09T07:00:05Z,How Durham University turned itself green,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/dec/09/how-durham-university-turned-itself-green,"Just two years ago, Durham was ranked 96 in People and Planet’s university league. So bad was its score that it was rated “third class”. Since then, the Russell Group university has managed to improve its sustainability credentials dramatically, jumping to No 30 in this year’s rankings of 154 institutions. Simon Park, Durham’s senior manager for energy and sustainability, attributed its success to initiatives such as the introduction of a formal environmental management system, ethical investment and sustainable food policies. The university also created a “greenspace movement” – including an app where users gain points for logging positive activities which go towards vouchers and charity donations, and a festival – to encourage staff and students to contribute to sustainability. The university has also implemented a “green move out” scheme, encouraging students to donate unwanted items to charity at the end of the academic year. Students had responded positively to the changes, Park said, and a team of student environmental champions and leaders had played a central role in the university’s approach. He said Durham was not complacent, however, and had appointed the Carbon Trust to calculate a target based on 1.5C warming above pre-industrial levels. The university planned to create a carbon management plan to ensure it was met, he said. Durham was also working with the Carbon Trust to calculate its full carbon footprint and to identify problem areas to focus on. Park said Durham was developing a biodiversity strategy and last summer employed three student interns to assess energy use in its highest consuming buildings. Through Institute of Environment Management and Assessment membership the university planned to provide online training for staff and “environmental champions”, he said. Park said: “As a responsible university we’re working hard to minimise our environmental impact, while also undertaking research that supports the wider agenda. Students are key to achieving change, and we have a team of environmental champions and student leaders involved across the university. They’ve been really positive about the changes we’ve introduced, and we’re looking forward to sharing the good news about our latest People and Planet university guide ranking with them.”",People & Planet Green League; Durham University; Education; Environment; Higher education; Universities; Sustainability; Students; Carbon footprints; Climate crisis,Education
2022-08-19T15:19:38Z,Prince William charity uses bank that is one of world’s biggest fossil fuel backers,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/19/prince-william-charity-royal-foundation-bank-jp-morgan-fossil-fuel-backers,"The charity founded by the Duke of Cambridge, who launched the Earthshot prize, keeps its investments in a bank that is one of the world’s biggest backers of fossil fuels, according to an investigation. The Royal Foundation, the charity set up by the Cambridges, also places more than half of its investments in a fund – advertised as green – that owns shares in large food companies. Some of these firms buy palm oil from companies linked to deforestation, the investigation by the Associated Press (AP) claimed. Prince William, a keen environmentalist, is quoted on the websites of the Earthshot prize and Royal Foundation as saying: “The Earth is at a tipping point and we face a stark choice.” Yet in 2021 the charity kept more than £1.1m with JP Morgan Chase, according to the most recent filings, and still invests with the corporation, AP reported. The foundation also held £1.7m in a fund run by the British firm Cazenove Capital, according to the 2021 filing, the agency said. As with JP Morgan, it still keeps funds with Cazenove, which in May had securities allegedly linked to deforestation through the use of palm oil. The foundation invested similar amounts in both funds in 2020, its older filings show. As of December 2021, the charity also held more than £10m in cash, it was reported. The investments, which are not disputed by the foundation, come as scientists repeatedly warn the world must shift away from fossil fuels to reduce emissions and avoid more and increasingly intense extreme weather events. Contacted by the Guardian, a Kensington Palace spokesperson said: “The Royal Foundation has followed the Church of England guidelines on ethical investment since 2015, and goes beyond these to prohibit investment in fossil fuel companies. We take our investment policies extremely seriously and review them regularly.” The foundation stressed Cazenove was instructed to operate within its strict investment policy that follows the C of E investment guidance, and additionally its exclusions on fossil fuel companies. A small management fee is paid on its investment to JP Morgan Asset Management and Cazenove Charity Responsible Multi-Asset Fund. The trustees take overall responsibility for the charity and its work, the foundation said. Compared with some other charities, the Royal Foundation’s investments are said to be small, with little impact on the climate crisis. But they are not in line with the ethos of the foundation, which lists conservation and mental health as main points of emphasis, or William’s public statements, AP reported. The Earthshot prize, a “global search for solutions to save our planet”, awards grants of up £1m each year to projects confronting environmental challenges. In July the Royal Foundation announced the prize had become an independent charity and William would be its president. JP Morgan Asset Management declined to comment on questions about charities investing in its products despite its record of financing fossil fuels, AP said. Bloomberg datashows JP Morgan has underwritten more bonds and loans for the fossil fuel industry and earned greater fees than its competitors in the five years up to 2021, it said. The environmental NGO Rainforest Action Network looked at direct loans and stock ownership along with bonds and estimated that between 2016 and 2021, JP Morgan’s banking arm financed fossil fuel companies with $382bn (£320bn). This was more than any other bank, AP reported. While the Cazenove fund is marketed as “sustainable”, as of 31 May the fund held almost $6m of shares in Nestlé, and shares worth $8.1m in Reckitt Benckiser, according to Morningstar Direct data, AP reported. Nestlé and Reckitt Benckiser have faced claims over palm oil supplies from Papua New Guinea, the NGO said. Kate Rogers, the head of sustainability at Cazenove Capital, told AP the company had engaged with Nestlé and Reckitt, and had seen progress on deforestation.",Prince William; Monarchy; Earthshot prize; Environment; Ethical business; Palm oil; Fossil fuels; Business; Energy; Charities; UK news,UK news
2022-11-12T11:00:39Z,Revealed: UK local councils deposit taxpayers’ cash in Qatar state bank ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/12/uk-local-councils-deposit-taxpayer-cash-qatar-bank-lgbt-rights,"The rainbow flag flew above the Bourne Corn Exchange as South Kesteven council embraced LGBT history month. A year after voting against such a gesture the Lincolnshire local authority declared itself pleased “to celebrate and recognise the […] rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people”, hoisting the flag outside its headquarters in 2019. Across Britain, many other councils regularly follow suit, showing solidarity with their LGBT residents through their support of events such as Pride marches. Yet, as a Guardian investigation reveals, at least 28 councils – including South Kesteven – have been quietly depositing more than £1bn of taxpayers’ money into accounts at Qatar National Bank (QNB), the state lender in a country where fans who display rainbow flags at next month’s World Cup may have them confiscated “for their own protection”. The investments pose a moral dilemma for western institutions dealing with the tiny, gas-rich Gulf emirate – whether to prize financial returns over principles. Some councils have pulled money out of QNB due to ethical concerns about Qatar, which has said it will welcome LGBT fans but where homosexuality is illegal, women are second-class citizens and migrant workers have died in their thousands. But others have carried on with the investments, described by the human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell as “shocking”. Investment firms, including Halifax and Hargreaves Lansdown, that flaunt their credentials on diversity, inclusion and labour rights, have also poured cash into accounts with the lender. Halifax does not appear to disclose this publicly. The investments take the form of funds deposited with QNB, which is 50%-owned by the Qatar Investment Authority, the $450bn sovereign wealth fund of the gas-rich emirate. Amid mounting criticism of Qatar’s record on human rights, the World Cup offers an opportunity for the emirate’s ruling elite to secure their place at the top table of global culture, politics and business. Qatar National Bank has played a key role in laying the groundwork for the sporting extravaganza. During the event itself, QNB will be the sole provider of cash machines at games in stadiums. More importantly, QNB helped fund the estimated $220bn of the tournament. According to its annual reports, the bank financed the Education City stadium, where nine matches will be played, as well as infrastructure projects to ensure everything goes off without a hitch. Few people in the UK will suspect that, in paying their council tax, they may have indirectly helped QNB bankroll these investments. Yet freedom of information requests to every local authority in the UK show that at least 27 have invested more than a combined £1bn with QNB since 2017. They do so as part of “treasury management” – effectively the storage of council tax money due to be spent on crucial public services. Their deposits at QNB, which has just one branch in central London, reflect the search for yield that more than a decade of ultra-low interest rates has foisted on investors, from local authorities to high street banks. QNB pays a healthy rate of interest – nearly 4% in some cases, according to council disclosures – a useful return for councils struggling with cuts to central funding. Most told the Guardian that this was in line with their investment strategy. But not everyone in local government appears to agree that depositing cash with QNB is appropriate. Spokespeople for Trafford and Blaby, both of which have invested in QNB in the past, told the Guardian that they had stopped doing so, citing their ethical investment policies. Ryedale said it did not have an alternative at the time it did deposit cash with QNB but admitted that the investment had been a “mistake” and said it would not do so in the future for ethical reasons. In Reading, the Green party councillor Josh Williams raised an objection to the council’s investments in a country with a “lamentable” human rights record, warning that Reading citizens might draw the conclusion that the council was “happy to invest millions of pounds in a country that would imprison homosexual men”. Reading’s last investment was in July 2022. It says QNB’s sustainability policy means it meets the council’s investment criteria but that it has suspended further investments. Councils that still had millions invested with QNB as of October 2022 include South Kesteven, Argyll and Bute, Swindon and Portsmouth. “It’s shocking to learn that local authorities are depositing council taxpayers’ money with a state-controlled bank in such a homophobic country as Qatar,” said Tatchell. “Through these deposits, local authorities are supporting a bank that funds the World Cup and sustain a regime that stands accused of human rights abuses against LGBT people, women and migrant workers.” Anyone who invests in shares may also have unwittingly contributed to the volume of cash deposited at QNB. The Financial Conduct Authority’s client assets sourcebook regime (Cass) requires stockbrokers to deposit customer money with a panel of major banks, to ensure that funds could be recovered if the brokerage went bust. The banks receiving the deposits typically include well-known UK lenders but some share-dealing brands, including firms that publicly support LGBTQ+ rights, use QNB. Earlier this year, Halifax won praise when it gave staff the option to display pronouns on their name badges and told customers who objected to the move that they should close their accounts. The bank also espouses its commitment to gender equality. But the Guardian understands that the lender’s share dealing arm, which manages £1.5bn of money on behalf of its clients, has more than £300m with QNB. Same-sex sexual activity is prohibited under Qatar’s 2004 penal code, which criminalises acts of “sodomy” and “sexual intercourse” between people of the same sex. Women must obtain permission from a male “guardian” in order to make key decisions about their lives, such as reproductive healthcare or overseas travel, according to a 2021 report by Human Rights Watch. By contrast, Hargreaves Lansdown sponsors Bristol Pride and has won awards at the event thanks to its credentials as an LGBT employer. Yet the company, which also boasts that it is a living wage employer, deposits up to 8% of clients’ cash – suggesting a maximum of £1.5bn – with QNB. Fellow stockbroker AJ Bell also lists QNB among the banks it uses, with a maximum of 35% of client money helped there, implying up to £34m. Not all stockbrokers publish the panel of banks they use to store clients’ cash, meaning many more may have deposited funds with QNB. QNB did not answer requests for comment. Hargreaves Lansdown and Halifax declined to comment. A spokesperson for AJ Bell said: “We evaluate and monitor a number of factors when assessing which banks to use to hold cash,” adding that this “includes a bank’s independently assessed ESG or ethical rating”.",Ethical business; Investing; Qatar; World Cup 2022; LGBTQ+ rights; Financial sector; Business; Middle East and north Africa; World Cup; UK news; Lloyds Banking Group; Hargreaves Lansdown; Banking; Local government; Politics; Football; Sport; World news,Business
2022-04-05T06:00:08Z,"I’m locked out of my account, but Co-op Bank doesn’t answer",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/05/locked-out-of-account-co-op-bank-emails,"In August you published a letter from a reader who found it almost impossible to contact the Co-operative Bank by phone. Nothing has changed. Both business and personal account lines are basically uncontactable, unless you have a few hours to spare. I was locked out of my business account for three weeks because I could not get hold of anyone. I now have a new key but can’t get through to activate it. There is no other means of contact – it does not accept emails or online messaging. Last night at 5pm, I tried again, and a message said it was unlikely to be able to answer before it closed. Closing time is 8pm. I have made several complaints and always hear the same story: the bank has employed more people and it will get better. I have been a happy customer for more than 30 years but this is becoming untenable. SW, by email If things don’t improve rapidly, I would be looking for a new bank. It simply isn’t acceptable to take three hours to answer the phone. Last year, the company blamed the delays on the pandemic and staff shortages, and said it was recruiting more people, but these excuses are wearing thin. Its Trustpilot page suggests that other customers are similarly frustrated. After I got in touch, a staff member contacted you directly, and your service was restored. It has also apologised. “While we’ve made some significant changes to improve our service levels, there is still more that we aim to do,” it says. “We continue to look for ways to increase the options for customers to carry out their banking needs through online banking and our mobile app. This includes investing in our systems and processes to reduce the need for customers who would rather self-serve.” It is worth noting that the bank is no longer part of the Co-operative Group. It was rescued by international hedge funds after its much-publicised problems. It continues to proclaim its ethical investment stance but, unless it sorts out its service soon, it could be facing an exodus of customers. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

2020-06-12T23:01:00Z,Ethical investments are outperforming traditional funds,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/jun/13/ethical-investments-are-outperforming-traditional-funds,"Environmentalists cheered by huge improvements in air quality during the lockdown – and the collapse in coal power generation – have another reason to celebrate. Even the stock market has gone in their favour. A detailed number-crunching of environmentally sustainable funds has revealed that they have outperformed traditional funds across the board – beating them during the pandemic as well as during the 10 years up to and including the coronavirus sell-off. The data, from the global research agency Morningstar, comes amid growing evidence that environmentally focused investing – once pigeonholed by City traditionalists as only for a vegan/hippy minority – is becoming mainstream. This week, Vanguard, one of the world’s biggest fund managers, launched two ethical index funds aimed at UK investors, while Aviva, Britain’s biggest insurer, unveiled a “climate transition” fund. Morningstar examined 745 sustainable funds and compared them against 4,150 traditional funds, and found they matched or beat returns in all categories – whether bonds or shares, UK or abroad. “Average returns and success rates for sustainable funds suggest that there is no performance trade-off associated with sustainable funds. In fact, a majority of sustainable funds have outperformed their traditional peers over multiple time horizons,” it says. Over 10 years, the average annual return for a sustainable fund invested in large global companies has been 6.9% a year, while a traditionally invested fund has made 6.3% a year. The outperformance continued during the coronavirus crisis. “In all but one category considered in the study, sustainable funds outperformed, with average excess returns in Q12020 ranging between 0.09% and 1.83% across categories,” Morningstar says. One reason may be that many US tech stocks, popular among environmental investors, have soared during the crisis, while shares in oil, gas and coal companies have plummeted. The Nasdaq index of US tech stocks has recovered completely from the coronavirus crisis, reaching new highs this week, while the oil giant ExxonMobil is trading at $53 compared with $70 before the lockdown. The Morningstar researchers noted that sustainable funds are longer-lasting than their peers. One of the tricks of the asset management industry is that funds that do badly are quietly removed – usually by merging them with another, better-performing fund. This has the effect of flattering the overall performance figures, suggesting that investors are doing better over the longer term than they really are. Morningstar found that three-quarters of sustainable funds lasted 10 years or more, compared with less than half of traditional funds. Campaigners welcomed the confirmation that sustainable funds are better. Michael Kind of ShareAction – a charity and company that promotes responsible investment – says: “It’s very positive, but also not surprising, to see that funds with robust environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategies are overall better performers financially. We hear from savers very often that one of the biggest barriers to action is that there is a perception that you will lose out financially if you switch to investing responsibly. “But is this enough? No … we would expect more ambitious and authentic ESG funds to deliver better outcomes for stakeholders and the environment but not inevitably to deliver investors more money every time.” ShareAction’s checklist for making your money more socially responsible Research what funds your pension/Isa/investment provider offers you. Look into the holdings and stewardship/investment policies of your funds, or those you are considering putting money in. These policies show how your asset manager will invest your money and try to influence companies on your behalf. You can either do this on your own or ask your investment (or pension) provider/employer/financial adviser for this information. It is important to see how your investment provider votes at the world’s largest companies’ AGMs. Are they voting for climate action and supporting human rights? ShareAction recently produced an independent global ranking of the most responsible asset managers across many topics. Use it to make an informed decision when selecting a manager.

2022-02-21T10:50:53Z,Concern over Church of England pension board fossil fuel industry links,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/21/concern-over-church-of-england-pension-board-fossil-fuel-industry-links,"Key members of the Church of England’s pensions board have strong links to the fossil fuel industry, research has shown, amid concerns over the organisation’s plans to end its investments in high-carbon companies. Analysis by DeSmog, the environmental investigation group, has found three prominent members of the pensions board of the Church Commissioners, the body that looks after Church of England investments, with former or current roles in energy companies, while other major figures have indirect links. The Church of England began to cut ties to coal and other heavily polluting industries in 2015, then pledged in 2018 to divest by 2023 from high-carbon companies that were “not aligned with the goals of the Paris agreement”. But as the deadline approaches, the organisation has said it is still “engaging” with key oil and gas interests rather than cancelling all of its holdings. Chris Manktelow, of the Young Christians Climate Network, said this was not good enough. “I understand why the church wants to engage, but I don’t think the strategy of engagement is working,” he told the Guardian. “The church should be moving quickly and showing moral leadership, and is just not going fast enough. We are not happy with this response [to the calls to divest].” There are also questions over the church’s approach to oil and gas companies that claim they are on a trajectory to net zero emissions. Some fossil fuel companies – including BP, Shell and ExxonMobil – have set out strategies to reach net zero, but many experts regard these plans as flawed. ExxonMobil, for example, is only planning to reduce the emissions from its operations, rather than those that arise from burning the oil and gas it produces. However, the Church Commissioners decided recently to retain investment in ExxonMobil. Manktelow said: “We think the church should reconsider this decision.” Manktelow said he was also “surprised and concerned” by the links between senior figures in deciding the church’s investments and the fossil fuel industry. Chris Mather, the chair of the Church of England pensions board, is a former chief executive of Shell Canada, from which he retired in 2007. During his tenure, the company embarked on a massive expansion into “tar sands”, which campaigners say has laid waste to vast tracts of Canada’s wilderness. Richard Hubbard, the chair of the board’s pensions committee, worked for BP for nearly 30 years, ending as director of the oil giant’s European cross-border pension plan before retiring in 2020. David Nussbaum, on the Church of England’s ethical investment advisory group, and a former chief of the conservation group WWF, has held a directorship at Drax since 2017. Drax is formerly the UK’s biggest coal-fired power plant and still the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions, having switched its boilers to burning trees. A spokesperson for Drax told the Guardian: The forests Drax sources from are not harvested to supply biomass, they are harvested for the high value timber used in construction and furniture making. Drax uses some of the by-products left behind when forests are harvested for these other sectors, by-products such as sawdust from sawmills, wood chips, tree tops and low grade roundwood which is diseased or mis-shapen and cannot be used elsewhere. We have strict sustainability standards which ensure the biomass we use does not contribute to carbon debt or deforestation.” Others with indirect links include Alan Smith, the first church estates commissioner, a former head of risk strategy at HSBC, the bank which has financed more than $100bn (£73bn) in fossil fuels since the 2015 Paris agreement; and Dami Lalude, also a member of the ethical investment advisory group, who worked in the natural resources group at the bank Goldman Sachs, which has also provided $100bn to fossil fuel interests since 2015. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, also has a background in the fossil fuel industry, having worked for oil companies for more than a decade before ordination. Darrell Hannah, the rector of All Saints Church, Ascot, and chair of the Christian climate change charity Operation Noah, told DeSmog he feared the decision-making bodies could be compromised. “We are deeply concerned by the Church of England national investing bodies’ ties to the fossil fuel industry, which raise significant questions around conflicts of interest,” he said. “How can the board continue to lead engagement with Shell, on behalf of Climate Action 100+ [an investor-led initiative to push big companies to do more on the climate crisis], when the chair of the pensions board is the former CEO of Shell Canada?” The Church Commissioners, the body that looks after the investments that pay Church of England pensioners, said the policy of engagement was paying off. “The Church of England’s national investing bodies have taken the view that they have more influence on high-carbon industries by being in the room rather than by disinvesting,” a spokesperson told the Guardian. “By engaging with high-carbon-emitting companies, we can address the climate crisis and bring about real world change. Our engagement is not open-ended and we are explicit in our expectation that we will disinvest from companies that are not responsive to engagement.” The spokesperson added: “It is not a surprise that we want experts from industry and finance on our governance bodies to help us make the right decisions. Our board members and their backgrounds are disclosed and readily available online. They operate to the highest ethical and responsible investing standards. They sit alongside other board members from a variety of backgrounds, including church and other third-sector experience. By calling out these individuals incorrectly suggests that the church’s decisions are somehow influenced by those associations.” The strategy was making “significant progress”, as 20 companies had agreed to “making climate-related changes to stay off our restricted list” since 2020, and a further 28 companies were excluded from its investment list on ethical grounds last year. “We want to achieve a net-zero world, not only a net-zero investment portfolio.” • This article was amended on 22 February 2022 to add a comment from Drax regarding its use of wood in boilers.",Fossil fuel divestment; Anglicanism; UK news; Greenhouse gas emissions; Environment,Environment
2022-05-11T15:51:46Z,Church of England to pump £3.6bn into parishes and fund more social action ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/church-of-england-to-pump-36bn-into-parishes-and-fund-more-social-action,"The Church of England is to pump £3.6bn into its 12,500 parishes over the next nine years in an effort to halt its decline by increasing “mission activity” among young people and disadvantaged communities. The money – a 30% increase in funding from the church commissioners, who look after the C of E’s central assets – will support social action projects such as food banks, and help the church achieve its target to be carbon net zero by 2030. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, and the archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, admitted the C of E had been heavy-handed in concentrating funds on urban churches in recent years. “Allocating money in the past was perhaps, if we’re honest, a bit too driven from the centre. Now we’re trusting the dioceses much more,” said Cottrell. Rural parishes have complained that they have been starved of cash, which has been diverted to inner-city churches. As a result, churches have closed and clergy jobs have been lost, according to a campaign group, Save the Parish. Welby said: “Over the last few years, the priority has been very much for the more heavily populated areas. Having listened carefully to what people were saying, this [funding] is for everyone, including the rural areas.” The core of the extra funding will be used for programmes that focus on young and disadvantaged people, deliver social action work, address racism and cut the church’s carbon footprint. It will support churches in the poorest areas of the country and fund more clergy in frontline ministries, including chaplaincies. “This funding will help the C of E raise its game in its service to the nation,” said Cottrell. The archbishops announced the funding increase from St John the Evangelist church in Balby, Doncaster, which runs a “multibank”, providing food, clothing and essential items for people in need, and a free coffee shop and drop-in centre. Cottrell said: “It gives me no joy in saying the Church of England has been in decline for a while. I’m not going to get depressed about that … What I’m going to do is focus on how we can best live and share the gospel.” The C of E could learn from the Balby church and others like it, which had been revitalised by social outreach work, he added. Welby pledged that the church would “speak out” about the cost of living crisis. “People in really quite good jobs, not minimum wage jobs, [are] finding that they just can’t make ends meet,” he said. The national funding from the church commissioners accounts for only 20% of overall costs, with the biggest share coming from churchgoers’ donations. The increase in the national grant has been made possible by returns of 13.3% on the commissioners’ investments last year, according to financial results for 2021 published on Wednesday. The commissioners increased their stake in Alibaba as the Chinese e-commerce giant became embroiled last year in a sexual assault scandal that led to a police investigation. It is the first time that Alibaba has appeared in the commissioners’ list of top 20 shareholdings since reports were first published online in 2013. It puts the company among the commissioners’ largest equity holdings, which last year included Amazon, the Google owner Alphabet, the Facebook parent company Meta, Visa and Microsoft. Reports emerged in December that Alibaba had fired the female employee who last summer accused her manager and a client of sexual assault during a work trip to the city of Jinan in Shandong province. Alibaba had previously said that it had suspended “relevant parties” for violating its rules and that it had a “zero-tolerance policy against sexual misconduct”. A spokesperson for the church commissioners declined to comment on specific investments, but said they had a “controversies policy” that assessed companies quarterly. “We always retain the right to restrict companies on an ad hoc basis if their activities fall foul of our ethical investment policies,” the spokesperson said.",Anglicanism; Justin Welby; Christianity; Religion; UK news; Poverty; Food banks; Social exclusion; Society,World news
2021-12-09T07:00:05Z,Majority of universities in UK ‘not on track to meet emissions targets’,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/dec/09/majority-of-universities-in-uk-not-on-track-to-meet-emissions-targets,"More than half of universities are not on track to meet their emissions targets, according to an analysis. The student network People and Planet has published its annual sustainability university league, which found that 46% of higher education institutions were on course to meet the target, up from a third in 2019. But the majority were still not on track to meet the target set for the 2020-21 academic year by the former funding agency the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce) in 2010. The league table assessed 154 institutions based on 13 categories including environmental policy and strategy, ethical investment and banking, carbon management and carbon reduction. Manchester Metropolitan University topped the table with a total score of 86.3%, up from second place in 2019. The table was not published in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Manchester Metropolitan’s vice-chancellor, Prof Malcolm Press, said they were “absolutely delighted”, adding: “Sustainability forms an integral part of everything that we do, from our teaching and research, to the way that we build and use our campus. “We know the environment is one of the top concerns for people of all ages and this award demonstrates the pivotal role that sustainability plays in university life at Manchester Metropolitan.” Its initiatives include developing a carbon literacy programme for all staff and students and a toolkit used by dozens of universities globally, a student-led sustainable food network, electric vehicles on campus and a hydrogen fuel cell innovation centre. The report found it had cut carbon emissions by 61% since 2005. King’s College London was placed second with 79.5% and Nottingham Trent University was third with 78.8%. At the bottom of the table were the Courtauld Institute of Art with 2.4%, the University College of Osteopathy (UCO) with 2.3% and the University of Sunderland with 0.7% – all of which said they did not submit data to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa). The most dramatic change came from Durham, which jumped 66 places compared with 2019 – from 96th position to 30th. Other big changes came from Imperial College London, which jumped 64 places up to 66th, and Cardiff Metropolitan University, which rose 63 places to finish fifth, becoming the highest scoring Welsh university. The University of Oxford rose 20 places to 25th place, while the University of Cambridge dropped 15 places to finish 82nd. London Metropolitan University made the largest carbon emission reductions, with a cut of 80% since 2005-06. Universities performed best in the education for sustainable development category, which assesses how they integrate sustainability into teaching and learning. But they performed less well in ethical investment and banking, with an average mark of 31%, despite more than half of universities having committed to divest from fossil fuels. They also performed poorly in managing carbon, with an average mark of 30%. The research found 51% of universities had made no commitment to removing fossil fuels from their investment policies. However, 40% of universities had introduced full divestment policies and 9% had made a partial commitment. After changes to higher education by the government, under which the Office for Students (OfS) took oversight of the sector from Hefce, it is no longer mandatory for universities to provide data on carbon reduction and other sustainability issues to the Hesa. People and Planet called for the reporting of this data to be made mandatory once again and for regulatory leadership from the OfS. Jack Ruane, the manager of People and Planet’s university league, said although improvements had been made in carbon reduction, “it’s still not good overall” and he hoped the gains made during the pandemic would not be “squandered”. Reliable sustainability credentials were vital for universities to attract prospective students, he said. “Students are wise to greenwashing. If a university says they are sustainable but invests in fossil fuels, students are not going to believe the sustainability credentials that institution claims. So it’s very much already part of the decision-making of students.” As a home to students, social space and workplace, campuses had the potential to change the long-term habits of thousands, Ruane added. The OfS said climate change was a “crucial issue for us all” and universities had an important role in reducing emissions. “The OfS does not have explicit powers in relation to the collection of emissions data. However, we welcome the fact that universities are increasingly taking collective responsibility for responding to climate change,” an OfS spokesperson said. The Courtauld said it was “committed to sustainability and has been making progress” but as a small institution it did not have the resources to make the relevant documentation publicly available to be scored. The University College of Osteopathy said it was unable to submit estates management data this year, adding: “We do not believe this is an accurate reflection of our performance or our commitment to environmental and ethical issues.” Sunderland said its last place positioning did not reflect its “full commitment – and successful work – around sustainability” and said it did not choose to submit the most recent data to the Hesa estates management record. “Our environmental sustainability plan to 2025 is already delivering a lasting impact on the environment, including investment in a new fleet of electric vehicles, installation of air source heat pumps and an ongoing solar power project already implemented on City campus now being rolled out to our St Peter’s campus,” a spokesperson said.",Universities; Greenhouse gas emissions; UK news; Higher education; Environment; Education; Manchester Metropolitan University; King's College London; Nottingham Trent University; People & Planet Green League,Education
2019-12-22T13:54:18Z,FTSE leaves coal and oil firms and G4S on ethical investment list,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/22/ftse-leaves-coal-and-oil-firms-and-g4s-on-ethical-investment-list,"Some of the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies, including Russia’s state oil giant Rosneft, have been added to the London Stock Exchange’s “ethical” investment lists. The FTSE4Good indices, run by the London Stock Exchange Group’s FTSE Russell subsidiary, are marketed to investors interested in environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. However, the LSE has refused to remove big polluting companies or the security company G4S despite allegations of systematic labour abuses across the world. At its latest semi-annual review earlier this month, FTSE Russell added the world’s 13th and 15th largest oil companies by market capitalisation, Rosneft and ConocoPhillips, to the FTSE4Good index. Rosneft Oil, Russia’s state oil company, produced 1.9bn barrels of oil in 2018. ConocoPhillips produced 468m in the same period. Other new inclusions were: Marathon Oil Corporation, a US company which produced 153m barrels in 2018. Lundin Petroleum, which produced 29.6m barrels in 2018. Origin Energy, which owns Australia’s largest coal-fired power station, Eraring. The FTSE4Good index rules explicitly ban coal firms, but the company also added Itochu Corporation, a Japanese conglomerate that mines coal as well as having interests including food, technology, textiles and machinery. Itochu’s coal-mining subsidiaries made profits of 65.2bn Japanese yen (£455m) in 2018. However, a loophole in the rules means that this exclusion only applies to firms whose main business is coal production – letting through conglomerates. The Guardian has previously reported that the FTSE4Good indices contain some of the world’s largest coal miners as well as oil and gas exploration and production companies. At the same time as adding the fossil fuel companies, FTSE Russell’s ESG committee refused to remove G4S, despite serious allegations over its treatment of migrant workers in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The allegations were detailed in a report by Norway’s Council of Ethics, which monitors investments in the country’s £860bn Government Pension Fund Global. The report said there was an “unacceptable risk of the company contributing to systematic human rights violations”. Human rights campaigners had expected the pension fund report – and G4S’s acknowledgement of issues – to trigger its ejection from the index. Wolfgang Kuhn, director of investor engagement at ShareAction, said: “We’re incredibly disappointed at FTSE’s decision. It’s deeply troubling that the index provider doesn’t consider evidence of human rights abuses to warrant exclusion from a so-called ethical index, particularly its failure to apply its robust exclusion policy when it matters most. “FTSE4Good is at best a mis-selling scandal in the making, and at worst continues to reward the most harmful activities in the corporate world.” The latest publicly available factsheets show that 65 oil and gas companies were already present on FTSE4Good’s emerging and developed markets indices. They included British and French oil “supermajors” Royal Dutch Shell and Total – the sixth and 17th biggest contributers to carbon dioxide pollution in history. Others included Italian supermajor Eni, Canadian oil sands miners Imperial Oil and Suncor Energy, and India’s Reliance Industries, the world’s seventh largest oil company. In a press release this month Italy’s Enel, the 13th largest, trumpeted its inclusion on the index because of its “sustainable business model”. “Looking at the number of oil companies listed in this index, this looks more like FTSE4Crude than FTSE4Good,” said Rosie Rogers, the head of Greenpeace UK’s climate campaign. “It takes some brass neck to argue that there’s anything ‘ethical’ about investing in the fossil fuel companies driving the climate emergency.” A spokeswoman for FTSE Russell declined to comment on the inclusion of new fossil fuel companies. On G4S, the spokeswoman said: “FTSE Russell and the FTSE Russell ESG advisory committee considered G4S against the controversy framework at this review, which assesses both the severity/scale of an incident as well as how effectively the company has responded. “Based on this assessment it was decided not to suspend G4S at this review. FTSE Russell will continue to closely monitor developments in relation to G4S.” The London Stock Exchange Group’s head of sustainable business, David Harris, has previously told the Guardian he would not exclude the entire oil and gas sector from FTSE4Good indices, saying divestment from those companies would mean forfeiting the ability to bring shareholder pressure to bear.",FTSE; Oil and gas companies; G4S; Ethical business; Coal; Stock markets; Business; Fossil fuel divestment; Fossil fuels; Energy; Environment; Energy industry,Business

Since the Co-op sold its underwriting insurance business in 2020, I don’t know who to choose. JL, Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire A simple question, but a complex answer. Unravelling the ethics of all the factors involved in an insurance policy is an open-ended task, not least because the brand you buy (the broker) is most likely to be different from the underwriter, which pays out on any claim. Tim Hunt, of Ethical Consumer, says the behaviour of underwriters is more significant than the brand. “We ask three questions: Does the company have an ethical investment policy? Is it making an attempt to address the climate impact of its investments and underwriting? Is it transparent about investments?” he says. “Sadly, few companies answer these questions adequately.” Ethical Consumer recommends Aviva, Allianz and Zurich, as they are open about where they invest and have relatively good climate policies.

2021-10-19T07:57:01Z,"Drop Chinese investments, MPs and peers tell parliament’s pension fund",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/19/drop-chinese-investments-mps-and-peers-tell-parliaments-pension-fund,"A cross-party group of more than 137 parliamentarians, including 117 MPs, have called on parliament’s pension fund to disinvest from Chinese companies accused of complicity in gross human rights violations or institutions linked to the Chinese state. The signatories include Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, and the former Conservative cabinet ministers Liam Fox, Iain Duncan Smith and Norman Tebbit. Others include the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson, Layla Moran, and the shadow foreign affairs minister, Stephen Kinnock. The Conservative MP David Amess was also a signatory, one of his last political acts before his death on Friday. The letter to the fund’s trustees follows research by the rights group Hong Kong Watch which found the Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund had £2.9m invested in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba and £900,000 in technology group Tencent, as well as investments in China Construction Bank and Sinopec, the chemical and oil firm. The letter states: “Aside from being two of the largest technology companies in China, Alibaba and Tencent regularly collaborate with the Chinese state in maintaining internet censorship through the ‘Great Firewall’ and have provided the government with surveillance patents for software which has been put to use against the Uyghurs.” It underlined that as the “the largest bankroller of Chinese state-owned enterprises”, Chinese state-owned banks “have spent the last decade buying up a substantial amount of strategic infrastructure in the UK”. Exposure to Chinese equities was problematic, the authors claim, “given the sanctions China has placed on UK parliamentarians”. Five MPs were sanctioned in March by the Chinese state as a reprisal for the British government sanctioning a group of Chinese officials allegedly involved in the mistreatment of Uyghur Muslims. The disinvestment call also comes after the Speakers of both the Lords and Commons banned the Chinese ambassador from entering parliament in September to speak to an all-party group. The Commons also voted in March to back a motion branding the Chinese state treatment of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang province as “genocide”. A group of MPs’ staff have also written to Legal and General about the pension fund. The Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh, a leading signatory and member of the Treasury select committee, said: “When the world is presented with such overwhelming evidence of gross human rights abuses, nobody can turn a blind eye. “But we must also ask ourselves what it means to be complicit and that’s why I’m horrified to learn that our own pension fund is invested in Chinese institutions with close ties to the state. If we look on, history will condemn our unforgivable cowardice and ask why those in power did not act. Warm words are simply not enough because this time no one can say that they did not know.” Sam Goodman, Hong Kong Watch’s senior policy adviser and co-author of the report, said: “If the drive toward ethical investment and making the UK a world leader in environmental and social governance is to mean anything, then MPs must ensure that their own pensions are not being invested in companies undermining human rights and look again at bringing forward legislation to regulate this sector.”",House of Commons; Politics; UK news; House of Lords; China; Asia Pacific; World news; Human rights; Law; Uyghurs; Islam; Religion; Xinjiang; Alibaba; Business; Pensions; Money; Tencent,Politics
2021-06-11T14:26:17Z,Alastair Hanton obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/11/alastair-hanton-obituary,"Alastair Hanton, who has died aged 94, was a banker and pioneer of ethical investment and fair trade, as well as a green transport campaigner. Through his innovations, he transformed the day-to-day experience of banking for ordinary British people. He introduced the system of direct debit to the UK, pushing a cartel of traditional banks to adopt more flexible payment practices in the 1960s. At the National Girobank, the people’s bank set up by the Labour government at the end of that decade, he was the driving force behind free bank accounts – giving millions of people the service for the first time. Turning the Link system of cashpoints into one in which any customer of any bank could withdraw money from any machine without charge was another of his ideas. His career as an innovator in industry and banking was followed by three equally productive decades as a founding father of the UK fair trade movement and a campaigner for ethical investment and greener, safer transport. His idea for direct debits was conceived when he was working in the economic research department of Unilever, which needed to collect irregular payments from thousands of small-business sellers of ice cream. He persisted in lobbying the big banks until they accepted the change in 1964. But it was an advertisement for a new national bank in 1968 that led to him finding his calling. Harold Wilson’s government – frustrated at the failure of established banks to provide services for the masses, most of whom could not afford their charges and lived in areas where banks did not deign to offer branches – was intent on founding a people’s bank to shake up the sector. It decided that the vast network of post offices across the country could provide a ready-made infrastructure for what would become the National Girobank. Hanton rushed to apply and was made director of operations. Working under a series of politically appointed banking grandees, he set about transforming the banking sector. Well before slogans about “levelling up” became fashionable, Hanton successfully advocated locating the centre of operations in Bootle, Merseyside, to bring employment to a deeply deprived area. Under his management the National Girobank pioneered computerised payment systems, optical character recognition that made instant credits and quick utility bill payments possible, and created the first interest-paying current accounts. Hanton saw his mission as preventing the poor, who often kept their cash under their beds, being robbed twice over, by burglars and by inflation. The early 70s were a touch-and-go period for the new bank, however. Edward Heath’s Conservative government, encouraged by a hostile Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail, thought about abolishing the fledgling institution, which had lost money in the early years. But by then Hanton had managed to make it turn a tiny profit and it was allowed to continue. Thereafter it grew rapidly and its innovative practices galvanised British banking. Hanton, who had by then been made CEO, was appointed OBE on retirement from the bank in 1986. Born in north London, Hanton was the eldest son of Maud (nee Evans), a secretary, and Peter Kydd Hanton, a public works architect. He attended Mill Hill school before reading economics and mathematics at Pembroke College, Cambridge. On graduation in 1948 he joined what was the British government’s overseas aid financing body, the Colonial Development Corporation (now the Commonwealth Development Corporation, or CDC) and was posted to Malawi, where a passion for social and trade justice was ignited. Back in the UK, he married Margaret Lumsden, a fellow Cambridge graduate who was working in market research, in 1956. Spells followed at the Bank of England’s Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation, promoting funding for small businesses, then at Unilever (1958-64) and the mining company Rio Tinto Zinc before the National Girobank. It was during this period that he and Margaret invited a Nigerian couple and their four children, who needed a home, to spend three years sharing the large house in Dulwich, south London, in which they had settled. While still at the bank Hanton began his efforts to make ethics a priority in investment. In 1985 he joined forces with a nascent initiative from church and charity groups, Ethical Investment Research Information Services (Eiris), to gather information on whether funds were invested in arms, tobacco, or apartheid-tainted activities. He joined the board of Eiris when it was incorporated in 1986, and served as an active chair and then trustee into his 90s, helping launch the FTSE4Good and other programmes. Eiris is now widely used by trade unions, churches, NGOs and fund managers to check the probity of their investments. A practising Methodist, on retirement Alastair became a trustee, and later vice-chair, of Christian Aid, and in that role was a driving force behind campaigns for debt relief for poor countries and the growth of the fair trade movement. The Fair Trade Foundation was created in 1992 by a group of leading UK aid charities, including Christian Aid, Oxfam and Cafod, with the aim of making sure a fairer share of profits for goods went back to producing countries. Hanton became its chair and brought together the disparate organisations skilfully, encouraging them to expand fair trade into the mainstream of retail. Those who worked with him describe his deep humility and generosity. Hanton was effective because he saw leadership not as a power role but as one of service and enabling others. His other lifelong passion – for cycling, walking and greener transport – began when his school was evacuated to Cumbria during the second world war and he and his brother would cycle back home to London for holidays. He was a frequent donor and tireless activist, often acting as trustee or chair, for dozens of campaign groups. Living Streets, the London Cycling Campaign, Airport Watch, Campaign for Better Transport and the Foundation for Integrated Transport were just a few among them. Hanton had a clear-sighted grasp of the importance of influencing policy at the national level — he took his campaign to abolish tax breaks for company cars and ban bull bars, which he showed caused disproportionate fatalities on UK roads, to a parliamentary select committee in 2001, for example, and was rewarded with success. But he gave as much time and effort to small practical actions to make things better. He believed strongly that individuals could make a real difference if they worked collectively, and were patient and persistent enough. Margaret survives him, as do their three children, Fiona, Angus and Bruce, 13 grandchildren and seven great-granddaughters. • Alastair Kydd Hanton, banker, social entrepreneur and transport campaigner, born 10 October 1926; died 26 May 2021",Ethical business; Banking; Fair trade; Ethical and green living; Environment,Business
2022-02-07T07:00:05Z,Green money: how your finances can help the planet,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/07/green-money-how-your-finances-can-help-the-planet,"Switch your bank account Moving the account you use for everyday spending is one of the easiest ways to make sure your money is being used in an environmentally friendly way. It’s often hard, or impossible, to find out exactly what the big banks are investing people’s money in, or supporting in other ways. So if you want to be sure your cash isn’t going towards financing industries or projects harming our world, seek providers who are explicitly backing green projects. Arguably, the UK’s most ethical current account provider is Triodos Bank, based in Bristol and part of a group founded in the Netherlands. It says it only finances organisations making a positive impact for people and the planet. Its current account, operated online and via an app, comes with a contactless debit Mastercard and offers an overdraft of up to £2,000. But there’s a £3 monthly fee, and no high street branches, so it won’t suit everyone. Of the high street banks, the Co-operative is the only one that has expressly prohibited support for fossil fuels, says Ethical Consumer, an independent, not-for-profit organisation that reviews companies and products. The Co-operative Bank calls itself “the original ethical bank,” but is now majority-owned by a group of hedge funds and fund managers, which may trouble some. Then there are app-based banks such as Monzo and Starling, which may well be “cleaner” when it comes to what they invest in and lend to because they are newer, smaller, and don’t necessarily have financial interests around the globe, but aren’t as transparent as a bank such as Triodos. “If you particularly want to switch to an app-only bank, Starling appears marginally more engaged than the others on ethical issues,” says Ethical Consumer’s website. Another option is a building society because they are owned by members, not shareholders. The biggest, Nationwide runs a number of current accounts. Meanwhile, some credit unions offer current accounts. To find one near you, go to findyourcreditunion.co.uk Moving your bank account is now quick and easy – the industry’s current account switch service has taken away a lot of the hassle. Sort out your savings A lot of the above also applies to savings accounts. The good news is, there’s much more choice. There are lots of building societies, including Ecology, which uses savings cash to fund environmentally friendly mortgages. It offers several accounts, including easy-access and regular-savings paying 0.1% and 0.8% respectively. Triodos Bank has a range of accounts including a junior cash Isa (for those saving for a child) currently paying 1.5%. Charity Bank lends to charities and social enterprises and has notice accounts paying up to 0.35%, and fixed-rate bonds paying up to 0.75%. Credit unions are another option. Don’t forget about National Savings and Investments (NS&amp;I) – its mission includes “providing cost-effective financing for government and the public good”. As well premium bonds it has a choice of savings accounts. Invest well There are a huge number of green/ethical/sustainable funds. Which you decide to put your money into will, to a large extent, come down to personal taste and how much risk you’re willing to accept. “With more choice than ever, and performance stacking up well against traditional funds, there’s little reason not to choose a sustainable fund for your Isa or other investments,” says Lisa Stanley, the co-founder of ethical money website Good With Money. Her site’ “good investment review” lets you see which funds get the highest green rating. For financial advisers, check out The Path Financial, BlueSphere and Castlefield, among others. David Macdonald at The Path Financial says: “It’s important to get under the bonnet and really ask some of the hard questions to make sure a provider is as green as they appear to be.” Use online tools If you are investing without an adviser, there are a growing number of apps, investment platforms and the like that offer ready-made green portfolios. Those that Stanley likes include Clim8 Invest, Circa5000 (formerly known as tickr), The Big Exchange (co-founded by The Big Issue), Wealthify’s ethical plans, and Moneybox’s socially responsible options. Meanwhile, Sugi helps you analyse the carbon impact of your current investments and offset your portfolio. There are also ethical investment platforms that allow people to invest directly in bonds or shares issued by charities and businesses. They include Ethex and Abundance. Move your pension There’s an estimated £2.6tn invested in UK pensions, and a chunk of it funds industries such as fossil fuels and weapons. But there are things you can do to make your retirement fund more eco-friendly. Most workplace pension schemes automatically put members into a “default fund,” which may, or may not be, very (or at all) green. But many offer an ethical or sustainable fund option, and staff can opt to pay some, or all, contributions into that. If it’s not clear what the deal is, talk to the trustees of the scheme. The good news is that during the last couple of years, a number of big UK workplace pension schemes have taken action – for example, by setting net zero carbon emissions targets for their holdings. This will see them moving away from investments in polluting companies. Go for a greener insurer Insurance can be tricky in environmental terms because there might be several companies involved in a policy. A comparison website can find youa provider, but the policy may be underwritten by a different company. Ethical Consumer says insurers with “better” climate change policies include Zurich, Axa and Aviva. The latter plans to be net zero by 2040. Stanley says: “On the smaller side, Naturesave offers home, travel and business insurance, donates 10% of its annual home and travel insurance income to charity, and plants a tree for each new policy issued.” Be aware that the Co-op sold its insurance underwriting business at the end of 2020. Green mortgages are go A growing number of financial firms are launching mortgages that incentivise buying or owning an energy-efficient home by offering borrowers more favourable terms than come as standard. That usually means either a slightly lower interest rate, or a cashback payment when the deal is taken out, or both. Some of these loans are restricted to people buying a new-build property. Lenders offering such deals include NatWest, Barclays, Nationwide and Leeds building society, with more coming on board all the time. Aside from the above deals, building societies are a better bet generally when it comes to mortgages due to the fact they lend mainly in the housing market rather than other more unethical sectors, says Ethical Consumer. Ecology building society specialises in home loans for properties and projects that have a positive environmental or social impact, such as certain self-build and renovation projects.",Consumer affairs; Consumer rights; Money; Investments; Banks and building societies; Green economy; Environment; Savings; Pensions; Insurance,Money
2022-02-15T15:24:22Z,The innocent have paid a high price for the Post Office scandal. The guilty have not | Marina Hyde,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/15/post-office-scandal-workers-computer-system,"Some stories feel so unbelievable that every time you think of them again, you have to sit with the basic concept for a few moments just to remind yourself how truly, staggeringly outrageous the whole business is. It’s almost as if your head has to be got round it all over again, every single time you go there. I’m like that with the Post Office scandal, which as of this week is the subject of an active public inquiry. In the spirit of rearranging our heads once more, let’s do the brief summary: between 2000 and 2014, 736 subpostmasters and postmistresses were prosecuted of theft, fraud and false accounting in the branches of the Post Office they ran. Their lives – and the lives of thousands of others – were torn apart. They were financially ruined, put out of work, locally shunned, driven into poor health and addiction, saw their marriages destroyed. Some – from a 19-year-old woman to mothers of young children to all manner of others – were imprisoned for many months. At least 33 victims of the scandal are now dead; at least four reportedly took their own lives. But … they had done nothing wrong. They had done nothing wrong. The blame in fact lay with Horizon, a faulty computer system designed by Fujitsu and imposed on their branches by Post Office management. It is currently being described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British history. And here’s the kicker – many post office operators had been reporting problems with Horizon to the Post Office right from the outset. The Post Office not only failed to adequately investigate, but demanded the staff personally made up the financial shortfalls, and denied to the complainants that anyone else had similar issues. Up in the rarefied air of the executive suite was Paula Vennells, who took over as CEO in 2012. Under her leadership the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of subpostmasters. To this date, more than 20 years on for some cases, nobody from the Post Office or Fujitsu or the civil servants charged with oversight has been held accountable, much less faced criminal investigation themselves. Instead, victims’ heads have rolled. So that’s the short version, but of course it all feels inadequate. Even simply listing every individual injustice in the sparsest possible terms would take far more space than I have available; at even cursory depth, every single story is utterly heartbreaking and utterly extraordinary. And to add to the sheer WTF-ery, these are subpostmasters we’re talking about, often working meticulously for long hours serving small communities. It’s backbone of Britain stuff – and the prison doors clanged shut on them. Among other burning questions, then, the current inquiry will look at whether the Post Office bigwigs knew there were bugs and glitches in the computer system, but pushed ahead with the prosecuting and the life-ruining anyway. I don’t want to unleash too many spoilers here – it’s important that viewers get to experience the breakneck magic of a British public inquiry in real time – but let’s just say that a high court judge in 2019 described the Post Office’s approach as “the 21st-century equivalent of maintaining that the Earth is flat”. Other highlights of the story? You’ll enjoy the episode covering the bit where Post Office CEO Paula Vennells gets a CBE in the year 2019 (TWENTY NINETEEN), and then gets made both chair of London’s Imperial College Healthcare NHS trust and something called “a non-executive board member of the Cabinet Office”, presumably because the government thought it important to bring in our brightest brains from business. By way of an inspired satirical touch, Paula also moonlighted as an Anglican priest and as a member of the Church of England Ethical Investment Advisory Group. (She has since “stepped back” from these positions.) In 2019, after the Post Office agreed to pay nearly £58m to settle claims, Vennells issued a statement saying “I am truly sorry we were unable to find both a solution and a resolution outside of litigation and for the distress this caused.” Ah. Students of apology types may have identified this as the classic sorry-that-we-just-HAD-to-hound-you-into-court apology. It’s a real pro move, and your inability to execute it is why you, an amateur, live in fear of losing your livelihood, while hotshots like Paula &amp; Co take millions and get bumped up into first class on the gravy train, no matter how monstrous their screw-ups. For while the postmasters have gone through the sort of wringer that makes Kafka feel like a Disney musical, extraordinary compassion has been shown to the managerial class in all this, who have been showered with honours and directorships and bonuses throughout. Elsewhere, it must be said that this sorry saga has not been the finest hour of much of the news media. Most papers and TV news outlets would now admit they horribly under-reported the Post Office story over the years, with all the running made by the likes of Private Eye, Computer Weekly and the BBC journalist Nick Wallis, to say nothing of the campaigning victims themselves, such as the heroic Alan Bates. As for the wider lessons of the scandal, what a lot it says about a society crossing the threshold of the third millennium that thousands of entirely upstanding human beings were disbelieved in favour of trusting a computer. Actually believing in the confusion and anguish of that famously gangsterish demographic – British subpostmasters – was regarded as a wholly irrational act. This, I’m afraid, is a version of only following orders. And it’s also, alas, the bit where those of us who cannot believe it happened simply have to look around us. Today, technology is deferred to even in the face of human tragedy far more than it was 20 years ago. Spool onward in the timeline and you will find more and more examples of ways in which technology was deemed to know best. In 2015, it emerged that in one three-year period, 2,380 sick and disabled people had died shortly after being declared “fit for work” by a computerised test, and having their sickness benefits withdrawn. Today, bereaved parents are told that nothing can be done about the algorithms that pushed their teenage children remorselessly in the direction of content they believe ultimately contributed to them taking their own lives, even as a Facebook whistleblower recently said that firm was “unwilling to accept even little slivers of profit being sacrificed for safety”. At the time the Post Office scandal began unfolding, Facebook wasn’t even a glint in Mark Zuckerberg’s eye; now, many technology firms are more powerful than nation states. At the time, Little Britain’s Carol Beer worked as a bank teller or holiday rep; now, computer-says-no culture runs the world.

2019-02-22T13:41:34Z,Just how ethical is ethical investment?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/22/just-how-ethical-is-ethical-investment,"Supposedly environmental stock market indices used to help investors allocate hundreds of billions of pounds in investments include some of the world’s biggest contributors to fossil fuel pollution. Index providers including FTSE Russell, MSCI, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and Stoxx all run indices that take into account environmental, social and corporate governance concerns known as ESG. FTSE Russell, owned by the London Stock Exchange, says it has a “hard exclusion” for coal companies from its FTSE4Good ethical indices, after it was decided that the most-polluting major fossil fuel did not fit its criteria for a sustainable future. However, major coal producers including BHP and Anglo American are included because they are listed as “general mining” firms rather than coal companies. FTSE Russell refused to provide the Guardian with a full list of index constituents but publicly available factsheets indicate that 34 oil and gas related companies account for 3.4% of the FTSE4Good developed index by market capitalisation. The inclusion of major oil and coal companies on indices is likely to prompt concerns about the term ESG being used to “greenwash” the reputations of major polluters. The New York-headquartered MSCI claims that investors worldwide have used its ESG indices to direct well over £200bn in investments since 2014. Fund managers such as Blackrock and Vanguard sell investors products such as exchange-traded funds, which track the performance of ESG indices. Savers whose money is invested using these indices may be unaware that they are funding fossil fuel extraction, said Charlie Kronick, a senior climate campaigner at Greenpeace UK. “In today’s world, many people buying products labelled ‘4 Good’ may expect that a fund created to take into account environmental impact would not include oil or other fossil fuel companies,” he said. “The stark reality is that to achieve the targets of the Paris agreement and avoid huge impacts on billions of people as well as massive biodiversity loss, there will have to be drastic changes to the way we power our societies, move around, grow much of our food and look after the natural world. Including oil companies in funds that are marketed as protecting the environment won’t help that transformation – it will slow it down.” Some index providers argue that ESG indices can be used to give greater weight to those companies which do better than their peers on various sustainability issues. Linda-Eling Lee, global head of ESG research at MSCI, told the Guardian this “competitive logic” can give companies incentives to improve their operations. MSCI’s indices favour those companies that “are actually paying attention to these emerging or latent ESG risks”, she said. All of the index firms provide detailed methodologies for their indices, assigning clearly defined ESG scores to companies. However, the scoring systems used by some indices only count direct and indirect carbon dioxide emissions, such as those from company vehicles or offices – ignoring the much larger emissions from burning fossil fuels extracted by energy companies, known as scope 3 emissions. David Harris, the group head of sustainable business at the London Stock Exchange Group, said scope 3 emissions calculations are not suitable for index creation. “Scope 3 is a great concept but if you want to use it for investment purposes there’s very little data,” he said. FTSE Russell’s aim instead was on “raising the standards over time” by engaging with companies on the indices on their environmental practices, with the threat of them being thrown off if they do not improve, he said. He ruled out excluding the entire oil and gas sector from FTSE4Good indices, saying divestment from those companies would mean forfeiting the ability to bring investor pressure to bear. Spokespeople for MSCI, S&amp;P Dow Jones and Stoxx also cited engagement with companies as a key reason for retaining polluters on indices. All of the index providers argued that they offer investors choices for how they structure their portfolios and that it was not their responsibility to rule out entire sectors. The index firms do offer sub-indices that exclude fossil fuel producers and they run profitable and growing businesses that can produce bespoke indices for investors. Catherine Howarth, the chief executive of ShareAction, a campaign group, said: “It’s daft that these oil, gas, and mining giants are allowed to be labelled as businesses with ‘strong environmental practices’ when their whole business model is predicated on extracting and burning fossil fuels. This speaks to a wider need for regulatory clarification on what constitutes a green investment but in the meantime a little common sense wouldn’t go amiss.” She added: “Investment firms and index providers must take responsibility for the products they market to consumers and implement stricter rules for qualifying for ESG indices. So much is at stake.” Index providers have previously resisted activist pressure to adjust their ESG indices but the activists have also scored some notable successes. Dow Jones Sustainability Indices removed Golden Agri-Resources, a Singapore-listed palm oil company, from ESG benchmarks in December, after Friends of the Earth accused the index of “greenwashing” a company behind deforestation. “There’s a lot of hiding behind opaque metrics of what sustainability investing is,” said Gaurav Madan, senior forests and lands campaigner at FoE in the US. He added that companies “hide behind [the] idea of engagement” with boards to improve practices.",Ethical business; Stock markets; Corporate governance; Investing; Business; UK news; Dow Jones; FTSE; Greenpeace; Environment; US news,Business

Good morning, I’m Mattha Busby with today’s essential stories. Trump plays down drone attack but reports say strikes were approved Donald Trump reportedly gave initial approval for the military to launch strikes on Iran in retaliation for Tehran shooting down a US drone, before pulling back at the last minute. Planes were in the air and ships were in position when word came to stand down on Thursday night, the New York Times quoted an unnamed official as saying. ‘Loose and stupid’. Trump had earlier seemed keen not to raise tensions further, suggesting that the shooting down of a US drone could have been carried out by a “loose and stupid” Iranian officer without authorization from Tehran. He also emphasized that the aircraft had been unmanned. Trump set to veto Senate vote to block Saudi arms sales The Republican-controlled upper house voted narrowly to block the Trump administration from selling weapons to Saudi Arabia, but the president has already promised to veto the measures. The White House said stopping the sales “would send a message that the United States is abandoning its partners and allies at the very moment when threats to them are increasing”. The UK court of appeal ruled on Thursday that British arm sales to the country were unlawful, and accused ministers of ignoring whether airstrikes that killed civilians in Yemen broke humanitarian law.

Senator Bob Menendez said: “These are bombs that we know have killed thousands of civilians in Yemen, patients in hospitals, children on school buses.” Major global investor dumps shares in US climate crisis laggards An ethical investment operation by the UK’s largest asset manager, Legal and General, has cut five companies – ExxonMobil, the insurer Metlife, the spam-maker Hormel Foods, the US retailer Kroger and the Korean Electric Power Corporation – from an umbrella of funds worth £5bn. Meryam Omi, L&amp;G’s head of responsible investment, said investor engagement with companies could be a powerful tool if there were consequences, and that although it retained shareholdings in the blacklisted companies within other much larger funds, it would vote against board appointments.

Hope Hicks: Trump adviser prevaricates in marathon testimony The Democrat-controlled house judiciary committee has released a 273-page transcript detailing their fruitless attempts to interrogate Hope Hicks, a former longtime aide to Trump who resigned as communications director in March 2018, having previously worked at the Trump organization. White House lawyers manoeuvred Hicks away from answering questions 155 times during a closed-door hearing on Wednesday, on issues as diverse as seating arrangements in the Oval office and the firing of the former FBI director James Comey. ‘Odd’. In a rare moment of candour, Hicks said she thought Trump’s order to his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to urge Jeff Sessions to “unrecuse” himself from the Russia investigation was odd.

2021-08-21T11:00:02Z,From solar power in Africa to UK tomatoes – the eco-schemes to turn your cash green,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/aug/21/from-solar-power-in-africa-to-uk-tomatoes-the-eco-schemes-to-turn-your-cash-green,"Environmentally conscious consumers fed up with low savings rates are being targeted by a variety of green investments paying up to 8% interest a year. However, those thinking about signing up need to be prepared to accept some risk to their cash. This is a lot riskier than a bank or building society savings account. The investments include a scheme that allows people to put money into companies providing African families with access to clean, affordable solar energy, and one involving a company that has found a way to grow “greener” tomatoes in the UK. Energise Africa enables people to invest in bonds issued by solar companies, allowing them to provide “life-changing” solar home systems to low-income families in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. For first-time investors, Energise Africa is currently guaranteeing investments up to £100. Launched in 2017, Energise Africa is the result of a link-up between Ethex, a UK-based ethical investment platform, and Lendahand, a Dutch-based crowdfunding platform. This involves putting your money into bonds (mainly unsecured, although some are secured) that are not listed on a public market. The minimum investment is £50. At the time of writing, there were several projects on the Energise Africa website either open for investment or about to go live. There is a 30-month bond from a solar company called Oolu, based in Senegal, with an expected interest rate of 7% a year. Oolu aims to raise just over £112,000 and says the money will help it provide solar home systems to 432 families in Burkina Faso. Meanwhile, a company called Sollatek in Kenya is offering a two-year bond with an expected interest rate of 5% a year. It says it is aiming to raise £40,000, so it can make 200 solar home systems available to families in rural Kenya. Also still open to investors at the time of writing was a two-year bond with an expected interest rate of 6% that aims to raise £500,000. It has been launched by a Kenya-based agricultural supply chain company called iProcure. Lisa Ashford, the chief executive of Energise Africa and Ethex, says: “We’ve definitely seen an increase in people investing across both our platforms since the beginning of the pandemic. There are multiple factors at play, including low interest rates, but we’ve seen lots of new customers that want to support initiatives that can have a direct benefit on their community or a positive impact on the environment. The recent UN climate report and events such as the Greek wildfires put this into perspective.” The guarantee on offer to new investors will reassure some, although above and beyond that guarantee, your capital is at risk and the returns are not guaranteed. In the worst-case scenario, if there is some kind of disaster, crisis or bankruptcy, you could lose some or all of your capital and would not be able to get redress from the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme or complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service. Meanwhile, individuals concerned about the environmental cost of food production are being targeted by a new investment offering 8% interest a year. On offer is an opportunity to put money into Sterling Suffolk, a company building and operating carbon-capturing glasshouses that grow “greener” tomatoes. The investment has been launched by the crowdfunding platform Abundance Investment, and the aim is to raise up to £6.75m. In the UK we eat more than 500,000 tonnes of fresh tomatoes each year but only grow 20% of them here. We rely on imports all year round, and this has a high environmental cost. The UK imports most of its tomatoes from countries such as the Netherlands that operate gas-heated greenhouses, or places such as Spain that benefit from lower heating requirements but have other major environmental impacts including transport and water usage. Based in Bramford, near Ipswich, Sterling Suffolk is tackling this issue head-on. Its semi-closed glasshouses are the first of their kind in the UK and use 25% less energy per tonne of tomatoes than other conventional glasshouses while capturing and reusing at least 75% of the CO2 generated from heating, a spokesman says. The minimum investment is £5, and those who put their money in will be buying tradeable debentures, which are like IOUs issued by companies. However, debentures are not covered by the FSCS or the FOS and, again, there is a risk you may not get back the money you invested or make any return on your investment. The quoted 8% return assumes you hold the debentures until maturity in October 2032. According to the offer document, someone investing £1,000 now would be in line to receive a total of £1,555 at maturity – ie their original capital plus £555 of interest income. These debentures are secured, in contrast to some other Abundance investments that are unsecured, and can be sold on to other investors free of charge via the Abundance Marketplace.",Ethical money; Investments; Money; Ethical and green living; Consumer affairs; Environment; UK news; Tomatoes; Solar power; Africa,Money
2021-04-23T11:42:43Z,Post Office’s aggressive pursuit of staff casts shadow over ex-boss’s tenure ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/apr/23/post-office-aggressive-pursuit-of-staff-ex-boss-paula-vennells,"When the Rev Paula Vennells stepped down as chief executive of the Post Office in February 2019, she walked away nearly £5m richer. As Vennells made for the exit, hundreds of loyal employees were still falsely branded thieves by the business that many of them had given their lives to. Under the seven-year leadership of Vennells, an Anglican minister, the Post Office had relentlessly pursued subpostmasters and subpostmistresses for alleged offences such as theft and false accounting. The missing money turned out to be the result of nothing of the sort, and instead owed to a glitch in the company’s IT system, named Horizon. More than 900 employees were prosecuted, many of them were wrongfully convicted and their reputations in local communities were destroyed. Some died before their name could be cleared. Those that were left had a wearying legal fight on their hands against a deep-pocketed employer. The outlook for Vennells, a minister at the Church of St Owen near Bedford, in the diocese of St Albans, was rather brighter. She had turned the Post Office from a basket case, making annual losses of £120m, into a modern and profitable business – an impressive turnaround achieved inside seven years. She was awarded a CBE for “services to the Post Office and to charity”. Shorty after her departure she took up a new post as chair of Imperial College Healthcare NHS trust, which runs several London hospitals. She was also appointed as a non-executive director at the Cabinet Office, joined the board of furniture firm Dunelm, and retained her seat in the boardroom at the supermarket chain Morrisons. Her roles with the NHS, Dunelm and Morrisons, the latter two part-time, were worth £174,000 a year. At the end of 2019, 10 months after Vennells’ exit, 555 Post Office workers reached a settlement with the company, which admitted it had “got things wrong”. For the subpostmasters, the £58m settlement cost was worth about £20,000 each. The Post Office has admitted that the final bill could escalate to more than £300m, a cost that the taxpayer is likely to have to fund, leaving Vennells’ turnaround of the Post Office looking a little less like a financial success story. One reason that the cost of the scandal has run into the hundreds of millions of pounds is the vigour with which the Post Office continued to pursue its staff, even in the face of mounting evidence that they had done nothing wrong. Much of that unwavering legal aggression occurred under Vennells’ seven-year tenure. At the high court, Mr Justice Fraser said the company had simply ignored the reality of what had happened, effectively “maintaining that the Earth is flat”. The Conservative peer James Arbuthnot described the Post Office’s actions under Vennells’ tenure as “cruel and incompetent”. Yet it was not until Friday, more than two decades after the prosecutions first began, that dozens of staff finally had their criminal convictions overturned, clearing their names once and for all. Vennells has since said she is “truly sorry” and has quit her positions with the NHS and the Cabinet Office. She retains her corporate roles with Morrisons and Dunelm. She also remains a member of the Church of England’s ethical investment advisory group.",Post Office; Business; Post Office Horizon scandal,Business

To build a sustainable and inclusive economy, we need to move away from this model. In Tottenham, north London, a pioneering solution is under way that could provide an alternative. After struggling for 15 years against a widely criticised regeneration plan, traders and residents in Tottenham have won the opportunity to restore a listed historic building and celebrated market for the benefit of the community. The Wards building opened in 1901 as one of London’s “grand department stores” and for decades formed an iconic gateway into Tottenham. Yet the construction of the Victoria line saw their compulsory purchase by Transport for London (TfL). They were derelict until 1985, when a market serving migrant communities opened on the ground floor. Years of underinvestment by TfL left the buildings dilapidated and in 2002, Haringey council designated the site for regeneration, with Grainger – one of Britain’s biggest build-to-rent developer – selected in 2004 as their preferred partner and awarded significant public funds to design proposals for the site. Grainger’s plans would have demolished the entire Wards Corner block, including the locally listed Edwardian Wards building and Seven Sisters Indoor Market. Known locally as the Latin Village or Pueblito Paisa, the market is an important retail and cultural hub for London’s Latin American communities. A 2011 report by Trust for London found that 85% of London’s Latinx diaspora rely on the clusters of businesses at Seven Sisters and Elephant and Castle to directly experience their culture – with both areas threatened by intensive regeneration. This threat was underscored in 2017, when United Nations human rights experts warned Grainger’s plan would have “a disproportionate impact on people belonging to minorities and their right to equal participation in economic, social and cultural rights”. Not a single affordable or social-rent home would have been provided at Wards Corner as part of Grainger’s scheme. Instead, it would have built 190 private flats and provided space for several chain stores, encouraged by planning policy that sought to gentrify the area, placing existing residents at risk of displacement. This outdated scheme was conceived in another era, before the pandemic accelerated the high street crisis that had been instigated by the shift to online retail, which has seen a 20% decline in high street visitors and 50,000 shops across the UK close in the past decade. Citing viability concerns and the changed economic landscape, Grainger’s withdrawal is a major victory for all those who want to see urban development for people, not profit. The community plan to save the market and restore the Wards buildings, first developed by El Pueblito Paisa Ltd in 2007, evolved over several iterations through public meetings, workshops, and events before gaining planning permission in 2014 and again in 2019, when it received hundreds of letters of support. The fourth iteration of the plan, co-designed by the architectural cooperative Unit 38, would sustainably restore the existing buildings and provide over 3,000 sq metres of retail space and cafe space with an enhanced market at its heart, alongside 650 sq metres of affordable workspaces and new community facilities, including a childcare centre. On the wider site, there is the potential for social housing development in collaboration with the council and the community. The buildings will be democratically owned and operated by a community benefit society led by local people on a one member, one vote basis. Grant funding, community shares and ethical investment will meet the estimated £12.9m cost of the refurbishment. Instead of extracting profits for remote shareholders, the surplus generated from the restored building will be reinvested in further community wealth-building initiatives in Tottenham: financial modelling commissioned by the West Green Road/Seven Sisters Development Trust suggests this could total as much as £84m over 60 years. The community plan represents more than the restoration of a neglected market and heritage building: it is a new, democratic model of urban development that benefits the people who live in an area, rather than distant corporate interests. Now all efforts must turn to delivering the community plan as soon as possible. Since the compulsory purchase process began, the urban block earmarked for development has sharply deteriorated, with vacant or dilapidated units becoming magnets for fly-tipping and antisocial behaviour, market tenants victimised and existing residents evicted and left destitute. After the most recent market operator declared insolvency in 2020, TfL were forced to step in as operator as a last resort. It uncovered serious health and safety breaches – including fire safety, electrical and gas risks – which it said left the market too unsafe to open. The market remains closed, nearly 18 months later, leaving traders without access to their livelihoods, and the community without crucial support throughout the pandemic. It is therefore imperative that the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, extends his financial hardship scheme for traders until a temporary or permanent market is in place, and for that market to be provided by the end of 2021. We now call on Khan to join Haringey council in offering his full support for the community plan and ensuring that the future development of Wards Corner delivers the maximum benefit for local people. As we emerge from the pandemic to face the stark reality of the climate crisis, how – and for whom – we undertake urban development will be critical to building a sustainable and just economy. The Wards Corner Community Plan is a viable and coherent answer to this question, which could offer a model for communities across the country seeking to rethink urban change. The late David Graeber – a friend of the campaign – once wrote: “The ultimate, hidden truth of the world is that it is something that we make, and could just as easily make differently.” Perhaps nowhere is this clearer than in our cities.

2020-11-14T10:00:02Z,Good returns: your savings can help homeless people –  and earn you 5%,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/nov/14/good-returns-savings-homeless-people,"Gerry McFarlane lived on the streets of Portsmouth, Glasgow and Edinburgh for years, sleeping rough because his alcohol addiction meant night shelters often wouldn’t accommodate him. He was typical of a section of the street homeless population sometimes designated as “unsuitable” or too challenging – but help provided by a charity has transformed his fortunes. McFarlane is now living in supported accommodation, enjoys good mental and physical health, is drinking less and finally has a place he knows is his home for life. The Edinburgh property where he lives is home to 12 men aged 50-plus who had previously been on the street or at risk of homelessness. A scheme has been launched that aims to replicate this successful housing model and individuals across the UK are being invited to become part of the solution to tackling homelessness by investing in the project. “It’s win-win,” says Helen Carlin, who is the founder of Common Ground Against Homelessness (CGAH), the not-for-profit organisation behind the scheme, and the chief executive of the homelessness charity Rowan Alba, which runs the original property where McFarlane lives. Those who invest their money in the project could earn 5% interest a year, which far exceeds what a typical savings account currently pays. The CGAH share offer – available via the ethical investment platform Ethex – involves putting your money into so-called withdrawable shares, which are mostly offered by cooperatives and community benefit societies. They are not traded on the stock market and typically do not increase in value but will often pay interest. Their sale is not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority because investors are deemed to be investing for “social returns”, not financial gain. This scheme aims to raise £650,000 by the end of this year. The money will help finance the purchase of a property in Edinburgh that will be converted into supported accommodation for nine people living with addiction problems who are currently – or are in danger of – rough sleeping. Carlin, 58, is putting her money where her mouth is: she is investing £30,000, a third of her retirement savings, in the scheme. “I believe that those of us who have enough should be able to help those who need it the most,” she says. “We want to establish a long-term, sustainable solution to homelessness in Scotland, and a model that can be replicated across the UK.” Solutions are certainly needed: Carlin says that in Edinburgh alone there are currently about 70 people sleeping rough as we head towards winter. The minimum investment in this scheme is £500 and the deadline for investing is 28 December. It is important to be aware that there are risks attached to this type of investment. In this case the shares cannot be sold or transferred to someone else but you can withdraw your funds. However, you may have to wait a while – withdrawal of capital will be possible “from no later than” March 2024. These are tough times for savers, with rates being slashed as low as 0.01% in some cases, but if you are prepared to take some risk with your cash, there are growing numbers of businesses, charities and social enterprises across the UK that are looking for financial support, and offering investors what are often quite impressive returns. Lisa Ashford at Ethex, an ethical investment platform, says: “Since the beginning of the coronavirus lockdown, with more people spending time at home and in their community, we’ve seen more people contact us because they want their savings and investments to benefit the local area.” Ashford says many are keen to be part of an effort to “build back better”. Also seeking funding is Nottinghamshire YMCA. It is looking to raise £3m to help finance the completion of a community and activity village designed to empower young people and families in Newark-on-Trent, the first phase of which is already finished. Todd Cauthorn, the executive director of YMCA Newark and Sherwood, says the investment will help to “start building a brighter future” for a district that in 2017 was officially ranked 323rd out of 324 local authority areas for social mobility. Many young people in and around Newark and Sherwood “don’t feel they have aspirations – they don’t feel like there are things there for them or being created for them,” he adds. On top of that, the impact of Covid-19 has pushed up demand for the YMCA’s services. With the new venture, the 149-year-old charity hopes to create more opportunities and better outcomes across everything from youth development and healthy living to education and employment. Among those who have already invested in the Nottinghamshire YMCA project are Sybil and Allan Reed, who are in their 80s and live in North Yorkshire. They have also invested in other projects via Triodos Bank’s ethical investment platform, and put money into the YMCA one “because it is community-based and provides opportunity and resources for the young and less privileged”. They say: “There must be many people of our age and background, especially during the Covid pandemic, with more disposable income, more time to manage that money in a responsible and informed way, more opportunity to follow its progress and outcome, and more certainty (being good Yorkshire folk) of getting a good return.” To support this project, investors put money into unsecured bonds available via triodoscrowdfunding.co.uk. This is a six-year product and when the bond matures in February 2027 your capital is returned to you. The scheme is targeting 6% gross interest a year, the minimum investment is £50 and the offer is due to close on 21 December. The bonds are transferable but are not listed on any investment exchange, so bondholders wanting to bail out would have to find a willing buyer. There are lots of other schemes looking for backing – Ethex and Triodos Crowdfunding are good places to find ones near you. Some of the other currently live include: • Bristol Energy Cooperative wants to raise £2m via a withdrawable shares offer to help finance a range of renewable energy projects in the region and is targeting a 3.5%-a-year investment return. Among the planned projects is what would be Bristol’s first hydroelectric generator, which will use the natural force of the water falling across Netham weir to spin twin turbines, producing enough energy to power 250 homes. The share offer is open until 31 December and the minimum investment is £100. To find out more, go to the Ethex website. • In London, North Kensington Community Energy is running a withdrawable shares offer to raise £107,000. It has already installed solar panels on two local schools and a community centre, and for its second project has fitted 138kWp of panels (enough to power 44 homes) at the Westway Sports &amp; Fitness Centre. The electricity generated will be sold to the sports centre at a discounted rate, with any surplus sold back to the grid. By investing you become a co-owner of the panels. The project will provide an expected return of 3% annual interest to shareholders, with the offer due to close on 31 December. Minimum investment is £100 – or £50 if you live in north Kensington and are either 24 and under or receive benefits. To find out more, visit the website of the south London-based organisation Repowering. Risks and rewards A “remarkable” 92% of businesses that have raised finance via withdrawable shares (also known as community shares) are still trading, according to a recent report from Co-operatives UK, the network for the country’s thousands of cooperatives. However, this type of investment is a lot riskier than putting your money into a savings account – it is possible that you could lose everything. Withdrawable shares and unsecured bonds are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, your money is at risk and returns are not guaranteed. Also, sometimes you have to wait several years before you are entitled to withdraw the cash you have invested. In June, the City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority announced a permanent ban on the promotion of “speculative mini-bonds” to small investors. The term mini-bond refers to a range of investments, and the ban applies to “the most complex and opaque” bonds – for example, where the money raised is lent to a third party or used to buy investments. Triodos Bank’s crowdfunding platform offers several bonds but says the ones on its website do not fall into the category identified by the FCA and so are unaffected by the ban.",Ethical money; Money; Investments; Savings; UK news; Coronavirus; Scotland; Edinburgh; Nottingham; Bristol,Money
2021-01-17T16:17:18Z,Church of England to step up pressure on firms to improve diversity,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jan/17/church-of-england-to-step-up-pressure-on-firms-to-improve-diversity,"The Church of England’s investment arm is to warn companies that they must do more to protect biodiversity and increase the ethnic diversity of their senior teams or risk protest votes at upcoming shareholder meetings. The Church Commissioners, which manages the religious group’s £8.7bn fund, will start sending letters outlining their demands to some of the worst-offending companies in the fund’s investment portfolio by mid-February. The team is drawing up its benchmarks and the shortlist of companies – both public and private – that will be targeted in its new campaign. Bess Joffe, the Church Commissioners’ new head of responsible investment, said the fund would ratchet up the pressure by casting protest votes at annual shareholder meetings within months if companies fail to comply. We [want companies to] have respect for the planet and respect for the people – Bess Joffe “I think you’ll see some vote impact as early as 2021. But of course it’s not going to be taking companies off guard – we will be communicating our expectations in the next four to six weeks,” she told the Guardian. Some of the fund’s holdings, according to a list released last June, include Google’s parent firm, Alphabet, Royal Dutch Shell, Samsung, Unilever, Facebook, Tesco and AstraZeneca. That is on top of property investments including London’s Hyde Park Estate and the Metrocentre in Gateshead, near Newcastle. The body has previously voted against companies for poor climate change policies and all-male boards. Last year, it voted against members of the Prudential’s board over an “unacceptably low” number of female directors and put pressure on the energy giant Exxon over emissions disclosures. The new focus on biodiversity and ethnicity is part of a three-year ethical investment plan being crafted by Joffe’s team. “We thought about recasting the way we think about things into two broad themes, so we have respect for the planet and respect for people. And I think that fits really well with the Church’s overall mission,” she said. Joffe, a Canadian who joined from Lloyds Banking Group in August and previously held roles with Goldman Sachs and Hermes, said the shift to biodiversity was meant to encourage a holistic approach to the way companies take responsibility for protecting life on earth and enabling the planet to thrive. “Ethnic diversity has not been a priority in any real way for companies,” she said. “They have to play their part in improving the lives of people who have been disenfranchised and left behind and who are going to suffer [disproportionately] as a result of Covid.” The UK’s biggest fund manager, L&amp;G, has already committed to voting against all-white boards who fail to diversify their leadership teams by 2022. In February 2020, the Parker Review showed that only 178 or 6.8% of 2,625 director positions across the FTSE 350 index weren’t held by white people. Joffe and the Church Commissioners are expecting progress. “You want to be in a world where boards of directors, management teams and pipelines of talent look like the communities in which they exist,” she said.",Ethical business; Corporate governance; Anglicanism; Christianity; Investing; Business; UK news,Business
2020-10-17T07:00:14Z,Rowan Williams urges UK universities to divest from fossil fuels,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/17/rowan-williams-urges-uk-universities-to-divest-from-fossil-fuels,"The former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams has called on UK universities to follow the example of Cambridge and end their multimillion-pound investments in fossil fuels. Williams, a former master of Magdalene college, Cambridge, said all universities had a duty to their students to create a “safer world”, and investing tens of millions of pounds in fossil fuel corporations was incompatible with this. “I hope the higher education world in this country and elsewhere will rise to the challenge and lead the way in securing a safer and fairer world for the next generation,” the academic and author said. This month Cambridge University said it would divest its multibillion-pound endowment fund from big oil corporations, following a five-year campaign by students, academics and politicians. Campaigners want all the UK’s leading research universities, known as the Russell Group, to follow suit. Daniel Johnson, a student at the University of Manchester and member of Divest Russell Group, said the pressure on university bosses was intensifying. “It’s not longer acceptable for any institution, let alone our places of learning, to still invest in fossil fuel companies and profit off the climate crisis,” he said. According to the student campaign group People and Planet, which has been at the forefront of the UK divestment movement, 17 of the 24 Russell Group universities have already committed to full divestment, six – including Imperial College London – have pledged only partial divestment, and one – Birmingham University – has rejected any move to divest. Last year more than 200 academics at Imperial signed an open letter calling on the university to divest fully from the top 200 fossil fuel companies. It said: “By profiting from products which are known to cause global climate change and cause serious health issues, these businesses are directly responsible for causing and aggravating the problems that Imperial seeks to tackle.” However, the university has refused to fully divest, saying it will continue to invest in fossil fuel companies as long as they are “actively moving towards meeting Paris agreement targets”. Critics have rejected this, pointing out that a recent study found none of the leading fossil fuel companies were in line with the commitments set out in the Paris agreement. A spokesperson for Imperial said it pursued “an active approach to investments in all asset classes – considering social, environmental and government” issues. They added: “Where companies’ current activities and future plans are not aligned with Imperial’s policies, and efforts at influence do not work, we will divest.” A spokesperson for Birmingham University said it was “committed to maintaining high environmental, social and governance standards across its investment portfolios. Since May 2019, the university has moved its absolute return fund investments to ethical investment funds where available, heavily restricting or excluding investments in companies generating revenue from carbon and fossil fuels.” Campaigners say their victory at Cambridge, which has one of the biggest endowment funds of any European university and had refused for years to countenance divestment, could prove a tipping point. Johnson said: “Universities such as Birmingham or Imperial are standing on the wrong side of history and we will escalate action if they won’t commit to full divestment soon.” • This article was amended on 20 October 2020. Due to an editing error, an earlier version referred incorrectly to Williams as the current master of Magdalene College, Cambridge.

2020-01-15T10:44:48Z,Watchdog urges UK charities to invest their billions ethically,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/15/watchdog-urges-uk-charities-to-invest-their-billions-ethically,"Charities are being told they should invest the billions of pounds they hold in reserve into businesses that chime with their principles, even if they have to take a financial hit. The Charity Commission is moving to promote ethical investment by charities to ensure funds are not used to support businesses that conflict with their own aims or those of their supporters. The shift reflects a growing sensitivity around the climate crisis which extends far beyond environmental charities, and what the commission sees as a changing public mood towards the transparency of the voluntary sector. Risk of poorer returns from ethical investment may no longer be a valid excuse, it suggests. The biggest 5,000 UK charities have a combined investmment of an estimated £116bn. This includes very large organisations such as the Wellcome Trust or the Church Commissioners, each with billions invested, so many charities may have just a few thousand pounds on the markets. Nevertheless, they face growing scrutiny from supporters. Helen Stephenson, the commission’s chief executive, said financial investments are about more than sums on a balance sheet. “Trustees’ decisions are increasingly seen as reflective of what a charity really stands for. And social attitudes on a range of issues, including around the environment, are shifting,” she stated. However, the move will not head off an imminent legal challenge by a coalition of voluntary sector groups seeking a definitive ruling from the courts on trustees’ duties in respect of ethical investment. The coalition haswelcomed the commission’s initiative, but wants the law updated. Luke Fletcher, a partner at law firm Bates Wells, which is working with the coalition, said charity trustees need clearer guidance about investments, particularly in light of the climate and ecological emergency. “Charities exist to benefit the public, not to advance their own financial interests,” he said. “So we think a court needs to clarify what is expected of charity trustees in this new situation.” Many donors do not realise that the charities they support hold substantial reserves for contingencies, including costs should the charity cease operations. The bigger investments are held by charitable foundations, which have a duty to make returns on endowments that enable them to make grants and sustain their own work without spending their capital. An inquiry initiated by charity leaders’ group Acevo in 2014 called for greater transparency around investments and action to tackle barriers faced by charities wishing to align them more closely with their stated purpose. This followed a BBC Panorama investigation showing that Comic Relief had invested in arms, tobacco and alcohol companies. The charity has since tightened its rules on investment, including a ban on fossil fuel interests. The commission has previously declined to strengthen its guidance, but now says that while it cannot tell charity boards what conclusions to reach, it wants to put this issue at the forefront of trustees’ minds and encourage and support them “to ask the right questions”. In a blog, the commission says trustees have a duty to maximise financial returns for their charities. But the law is clear that they may take ethical or other non-financial considerations into account. “We want trustees to feel empowered to respond to these expectations where they can and consider investments that chime with their charity’s purpose, as the law allows,” said Stephenson. The commission previously said that seeking a ruling by the charity tribunal in the high court could be costly, time-consuming and risk uncertain outcome. But Fletcher said the coalition is resolved to press the case: trustees need reassurance that they would, for instance, be protected from sanction if they chose to align investments with the goals of the Paris climate agreement “even if the market as a whole takes a different approach”. A ruling is expected within months. Caron Bradshaw, chief executive of the Charity Finance Group, which represents charity finance directors and managers, said charities are under mounting pressure from donors on the type of investment they may make. “There is definitely huge interest in how far you can go with this, so greater clarity will be widely welcomed.”",Charities; Voluntary sector; Society; Ethical business; Ethical money; Society Professionals,Society
2020-10-02T10:12:59Z,Cambridge is right to join the flight from fossil fuels. But divestment is just a start,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/02/cambridge-fossil-fuels-divestment-fossil-fuels-climate-emergency,"It’s been a year of considerable blows to the fossil fuel industry. Thursday’s announcement that the University of Cambridge will divest its endowment fund from fossil fuel corporations is another considerable win for campaigners, who have spent many years doggedly demanding change from an institution that – despite being a global leader in scientific research and education – has been obstinate about severing its many ties to the fossil fuel industry, including significant research funding from Shell and BP. Of course, serious questions will doubtless be raised about why a full decade is needed to shift money out of direct fossil fuel investments, and until 2038 to arrive at a “net-zero portfolio”. And the absence of a commitment on cutting the university’s close research ties with fossil fuel companies is also sure to draw some ire. Ultimately, however, the announcement is significant for the message it sends about the future of the fossil fuel industry. It joins a swelling chorus of voices spanning cities from Oslo to LA, more than half of UK universities, the Republic of Ireland, Norway’s $1tn sovereign wealth fund, and even – in a very limited way – BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. Divestment pledges worldwide now total $11tn worth of fossil fuel assets. But as encouraging as this snowballing divestment has been to watch, the fact that even companies such as BlackRock – with its notoriously poor record on climate – are slowly coming onboard should prompt some reflection on the stage the divestment movement has reached, and whether it needs to evolve if it’s to continue pushing for the radicalism we need. We appear to have firmly entered the era that divestment campaigners have long foreseen: fossil fuels are simply no longer good investments. This year, oil companies have written down billions in assets, and waves of bankruptcies have swept US shale gas while the North Sea oil and gas industry has shed jobs. ExxonMobil was removed from the Dow Jones industrial average after nearly a century, and five tech companies now dominate the S&amp;P500, occupying an astonishing 20% of the index’s value compared with the measly 2.3% claimed by the entire energy sector. Prudent financial institutions are responding by shifting investments to industries where returns are both greater and more secure in the long term. Sometimes this includes green energy, but often it simply means following the market, with freed-up cash shifting to tech and other financial companies. Even “ethical” investment strategies, so-called “ESG (environmental, social, governance)” funds, have come under fire for poor quality control, inconsistent or dubious ratings, and questionable impacts. Divestment has played a significant part in advancing the timeline for fossil fuels’ demise. Although questions have been raised about the immediate impact of divestment on share prices, the movement has undoubtedly stigmatised investments in the fossil fuel industry. Last year, Shell admitted the divestment movement posed a “material risk” to its business model. But there is a limit to the number of endowments and funds that represent beneficiaries who can be readily organised and are willing to submit to these demands, such as student bodies, religious communities and the constituents of progressive councils and cities. A vast amount of the financial system is deeply undemocratic, and – despite the industry’s gloomy outlook – demonstrably unresponsive to demands for an end to fossil fuel finance. Just five North American banks, for instance, have financed nearly $1tn in fossil fuels since 2016, with little sign of slowing. The question, then, is what comes next? Divestment is a means of addressing an urgent, immediate problem: the financing of fossil fuels. But the divestment movement is fighting a war of attrition, in which its opponents – at least within the economic and political systems built by and for them – are considerably better resourced. The climate crisis is a product of those same systems, and it demands that we fight against them. Climate and environmental breakdown are a crisis of inequality, rooted in profound imbalances in wealth and power both within and between countries. A spate of reports and letters from leading scientists have sounded the alarm on this sober reality, and warned that we will likely fail in combating the climate crisis unless we radically reduce inequality and redistribute consumption and resource use. The divestment leader and legendary activist Bill McKibben was right when he said “money is the oxygen on which the fire of global warming burns”. But we need to be just as concerned with its distribution as we are with its flow. There’s a long way to go to “turn off the tap”, and the divestment movement is still very much needed. But to challenge the status quo driving this crisis in the first place, the movement must challenge the immense and undemocratic structural power of the financial system, and the explosion of inequality it has supported, and not settle for greener portfolios.

2020-09-27T14:07:37Z,Covid cases at UK food factories could be over 30 times higher than reported,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/27/covid-cases-at-food-factories-in-uk-could-be-over-30-times-higher-than-reported,"The number of Covid-19 infections at food factories that supply UK supermarkets and restaurants could be more than 30 times higher than reported, according to a report which says employers have too much influence over official data. Food manufacturing – and meat processing plants in particular – have been at the heart of several major local outbreaks, with workers reporting cramped conditions and pressure not to take days off even when displaying symptoms. But just 47 notifications of Covid-19 workplace infections – and no deaths – have been reported to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) by food manufacturing companies, who employ 430,000 people in the UK. An investigation by Pirc, which advises shareholders on ethical investment, found that there have been at least 1,461 infections and six deaths, with the true figures likely to be even higher. Pirc said the discrepancy was partly due to a loophole that allows companies to determine whether employees were infected on the job, or elsewhere, when they submit reports via the HSE’s Riddor reporting system. One person interviewed for the report told of fake safety audits at a large plant in Lincolnshire, adding that staff had been told to wear cake boxes as makeshift masks. “Audits are a sham,” said another interviewee. “Auditors sit in an office for an hour when they arrive to do paperwork and everyone cleans up the plant.” “Colleagues with COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease] were asked to come back into work,” said another food worker. “When they were shielding, they were earning less than half of what they would have earned on furlough.” Pirc’s labour specialist, Alice Martin, said the findings showed that figures submitted to HSE by companies, who can be fined for lax workplace safety conditions, “lack credibility”. “We urge companies across all sectors to put as much information as possible on testing, cases and fatalities into the public domain,” she said. Pirc based its findings on one-to-one worker interviews, trade union surveys and media reports about food processing companies. Firms named in media reports of outbreaks include Greencore, Bakkavör, 2 Sisters, Cranswick and Moy Park – all of which are major suppliers to supermarkets and restaurants. There is no suggestion of deliberate under-reporting by any of the companies named. Labour and trade unions hit out at employers and the government, saying workers and the public are being put at risk by a faulty reporting system. The Labour MP Luke Pollard said ministers had turned a blind eye to virus outbreaks in food plants. “Labour has pressed ministers repeatedly for action to support people working in these environments but the response from government has been lacklustre at best,” he said. “While there are some good employers in the food processing sector there are also far too many that are not taking the safety of their workers seriously. “This underreporting of Covid cases could lead to further outbreaks, meaning we’d lose control of the virus even more.” Unite national officer Bev Clarkson said official figures were “drastically at odds” with the reality faced by food processing workers, particularly in the meat industry. “The cold temperatures, metal surfaces and close working conditions found in many food manufacturing sites make them easy environments for the virus to spread in,” she said. “In too many workplaces these risk factors have been exacerbated by employers neglecting to implement proper coronavirus health and safety measures, as well as refusing to provide adequate sick pay to those who need to self-isolate.” An HSE spokesperson stressed that it was a legal duty for employers to report cases where there was “reasonable evidence” suggesting a worker caught coronavirus at work. “We are committed to getting the most accurate picture possible and working with employers who don’t report Riddors as they should. “If someone sadly dies from Covid-19 infection, again with reasonable evidence of a workplace exposure, if the Riddor report meets the investigation criteria, the case is progressed and an investigation initiated. “We firmly encourage employers and workers to ensure concerns relating to coronavirus are actively raised and brought to HSE’s attention if required. Firm action will be taken where appropriate.” The Guardian approached all of the companies named in media reports cited by Pirc. A spokesperson for the British Meat Processors Association said: “There have been a small number of outbreaks. Companies that experience an outbreak work together with the IMT (incident management team) from the local competent authorities and follow their lead to limit the outbreak and possible cause of transmission. “Our members have put many physical barriers in place to protect employees in the production areas along with many other measures to protect the workforce.” Bakkavör, the leading provider of fresh prepared food in the UK, said: “Bakkavör has reported all positive cases of Covid to the PHE [Public Health England] and have also fully complied with the HSE’s Riddor regulatory requirements.”",Meat industry; Coronavirus; Business; UK news; Infectious diseases; Supermarkets,Environment
2021-01-08T08:00:32Z,'We didn't want our pensions invested in anything that was causing harm',https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/jan/08/pensions-green-current-accounts-to-savings,"Lots of people have started 2021 with the aim of making green lifestyle changes such as going vegan or giving up flying. But arguably the most powerful environmental changes you can make as an individual involve your finances, whether it’s the cash in your current account or the money you are saving for retirement. Research issued this week by the ethical bank Triodos found that almost 20 million Britons plan to do their bit to live a greener lifestyle this year. But it added: “Few recognise the impact that switching their finances to greener suppliers can have.” In part, that is because of the scale of the sums of money involved. For example, there is an estimated £3tn invested in UK pensions, and Richard Curtis’s Make My Money Matter campaign claims that moving your retirement savings to sustainable funds “can be 27 times as effective at reducing your carbon footprint than eating less meat, using public transport, reducing water use and flying less combined”. The good news for anyone who wants to make a difference is that there are lots of green and ethical options out there. Current accounts This is a good place to start for those looking to make a positive change. If you want to be sure your money isn’t financing fossil fuels or other controversial industries, you may want to consider moving to a bank such as Triodos, which “only lends to organisations that positively affect people’s lives, protect the planet or build strong communities”. The Triodos current account can be operated online and via an app, comes with an eco-friendly contactless debit Mastercard (it is made from a plastic substitute derived from renewable sources) and offers an overdraft of up to £2,000. But a stumbling block for some will be the £3 monthly account fee, or the fact that Triodos doesn’t have any high street branches. Triodos is highly rated by Ethical Consumer, an independent, not-for-profit co-operative that reviews companies and products. According to Ethical Consumer, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, NatWest, Santander and the TSB owner, Sabadell, are among the big names that continue to provide finance for, or invest in, fossil fuel companies. It adds that of the high street banks, the Co-operative Bank is the only one that has expressly prohibited support for fossil fuels. The Co-op Bank is famous for its customer-led ethical policy but some will be uneasy about the fact that it is majority-owned by a group of US hedge funds and fund managers. Some will favour a building society because they are owned by members, not shareholders, and have a strong tradition of helping people to buy their own home. Becky and Roy Francomb, aged 55 and 61 respectively, recently decided they wanted to move their bank accounts to somewhere more ethical. They were both with NatWest but were unhappy about its financial links with fossil fuel companies. They considered Triodos but ended up plumping for Nationwide building society because there is a branch in Seaford in East Sussex, where they live. Savings Much of the above also applies to savings accounts – however, you will find there is a lot more choice. There are dozens of building societies to pick between, including the Ecology, which has a focus on sustainable living, currently offers easy access, cash Isa and regular savings accounts paying 0.2%, 0.45% and 1.1% respectively. Meanwhile, Triodos has a range of accounts including a one-year fixed-rate savings bond paying 0.4% and a junior cash Isa (for those saving for a child) currently paying 1.5%. Charity Bank lends to charities and social enterprises and has notice accounts paying up to 0.5%, and fixed-rate bonds paying up to 0.75%. There are also scores of credit unions. To find ones that may suit you, go to findyourcreditunion.co.uk. NS&amp;I (aka National Savings) has been slashing rates lately but may still appeal to some because its mission is “providing cost-effective financing for government and the public good”. Pensions Campaigners argue that a good chunk of the money invested in UK pensions supports industries that are harming people and the planet. The Francombs recently worked with ethical financial advice firm the Path to transfer some of their pension cash from conventional funds to ones that align with the UN’s sustainable development goals. Becky, who has just taken early retirement from the NHS, where she worked as a project manager, is a member of Extinction Rebellion along with her husband. They have both taken part in a number of actions and have both been arrested. “As environmental activists, we didn’t want our pensions invested in anything that was causing harm – fossil fuels, weapons, anything like that,” she says. “We do try to live sustainably – we no longer fly, have a mainly plant-based diet, and cycle instead of drive wherever possible – but, to me, moving our pensions is the most responsible thing we can do.” Roy officially retired from his job as a community family worker this week and had a lump sum with Standard Life, which he has transferred. The couple’s cash is now in a range of funds operated by companies such as Baillie Gifford (its Positive Change Fund), Fidelity (Sustainable Water &amp; Waste Fund) and Royal London (Sustainable Leaders), where the top holdings include the electric car manufacturer Tesla and the US biotech firm and Covid-19 vaccine maker Moderna. David Macdonald, the founder of the Path, believes this is by far the best way individuals can help the environment. “Without checking exactly how and where pension funds are invested, people could be propping up companies that support fossil fuel developments, deforestation and those involved in warfare,” he says. Most workplace pension schemes automatically default members into a prescribed fund, although many offer an ethical or sustainable fund option and will allow employees to allocate some or all of their money to that. If you are unhappy with the options available, you could contact the trustees of your workplace pension scheme to ask how much of your money is invested in – for example – fossil fuels, if there is a divestment option (where money is moved out of things such as oil, coal and gas companies) and, if not, could one be set up. Investments Choosing ethical funds has definitely paid off for investors. Data from the investment firm AJ Bell shows that the average 10-year total return from UK non-ethical funds stood at 81% at the end of September 2020, while for UK ethical funds it was 104%. The top-performing ethical fund over the 10 years, with a 196% return, was Royal London Sustainable Leaders. The number of funds available is growing all the time. However, as each individual has their own views about the companies and sectors they are happy to support with their cash, and how much risk they are willing to accept, it is a good idea to talk to a financial adviser. There are also a number of ethical investment platforms that typically allow people to invest directly in bonds or shares issued by charities and businesses. They include Ethex, Abundance and Triodos’s crowdfunding site. Mortgages It used to be pretty much only Ecology building society that was selling green mortgages but there are now a few lenders offering them. For example, last June, Saffron building society launched the Retro Fit Mortgage, which rewards borrowers with a rate reduction if they carry out work that improves a property’s energy efficiency, and Nationwide has a similar offer for additional borrowing. Similarly, NatWest recently launched a scheme where people who buy a home with an energy performance certificate rating of A or B can get a reduced rate and £250 cashback on selected fixed-rate mortgages.",Ethical money; Money; Consumer affairs; Pensions; Current accounts; Banks and building societies; Savings; Investments; Mortgages; Ethical and green living; Environment; UK news,Money
2020-07-10T15:11:30Z,Boohoo shareholder sells off shares in firm worth nearly £80m,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jul/10/boohoo-shareholder-sells-off-shares-aberdeen-standard-investments,"One of Boohoo’s largest shareholders has sold the majority of its stake in the online fashion retailer, saying the company’s response to reports of poor working conditions in its supply chain had been inadequate. Aberdeen Standard Investments sold off 27m shares this week, representing two-thirds of its shareholding, as it said recent events had knocked its conviction that Boohoo was improving standards. It is not clear if Aberdeen intends to sell its remaining 13m shares. Lesley Duncan, the deputy head of UK equities at Aberdeen Standard, which was the company’s sixth largest shareholder before the share sale, said it had invested in Boohoo when it listed on the stock market in 2015, at which point the fashion firm met its ethical criteria. She said: “Over the years we have lobbied the company to improve its management of supply chain transparency, environmental efficiency and working conditions. While we would have liked progress to have been quicker we did feel that progress was being made. “However, in the last few weeks our concerns have grown on the progress being made, which even before recent developments had negatively impacted our conviction levels in the company. Having spoken to Boohoo’s management team a number of times this week in light of recent concerning allegations, we view their response as inadequate in scope, timeliness and gravity.” Duncan said Aberdeen Standard tried to use its influence as an investor to prompt change but in instances where standards had not been met, divestment was appropriate and responsible. The shares sold were worth nearly £80m at Thursday’s closing price. The largest shareholder in Boohoo is its co-founder and executive chairman, Mahmud Kamani, with a 12% stake. The divestment came despite Boohoo announcing on Wednesday an independent review of its UK supply chain. The review, led by Alison Levitt QC, will be accompanied by a £10m investment in “eradicating malpractice” in its supply chain. Ethical investment experts said Aberdeen Standard’s move, which followed allegations of low pay and poor hygiene at a Leicester-based supplier to Boohoo, was likely to influence other groups to reassess their holdings in the company. Ben Nelmes, head of public policy at the UK Sustainable Investment &amp; Finance Association, said: “Boohoo is a company that a lot of ethical investors have had concerns about for a long time. Some won’t go near it and some have made repeated representations to management to get them to improve what they are doing. No doubt having seen what Boohoo have said and done in recent days, some will be leaning more towards what Aberdeen Standard have done.” According to the Morningstar research group, 20 sustainable funds have investments in Boohoo, including funds offered by Legal &amp; General Investment Management and Man Group. L&amp;G said it would be raising concerns with Boohoo’s management in the coming weeks. Man Group said: “The reported issues at Boohoo are concerning and our stewardship team is looking closely at how we can most effectively engage with them on it.” Shares in Boohoo dropped 2.3% on Friday to 280p, partly reversing a bounceback on Thursday from three days of declines. The shares have dived 28% in a week, wiping £1.4bn off the value of the company – which is now worth £3.5bn. The hit came after allegations in the Sunday Times that a factory in Leicester supplying the company, which owns a string of brands including Nasty Gal and Pretty Little Thing, paid workers below the minimum wage and failed to provide adequate protection from the coronavirus outbreak. The reports follow a string of exposés on poor labour rights in garment factories in Leicester, where Boohoo sources 40% of its clothing, kicked off by an Ethical Trading Initiative-backed report in 2015. Thulsi Narayanasamy, at the Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre, which has campaigned for investors to divest from Boohoo over labour rights issues, said: “This [divestment] has been a long time coming. It is remarkable that it has taken an exposé in 2020, five years after the issue was first raised. It should be taken as a sign for other brands that poor labour rights are not acceptable.”",Boohoo; Retail industry; UK news; Business; Stock markets; Shares; Corporate governance; Aberdeen Asset Management; Money; Investments; Fashion industry,Business

If you don’t want to hand over your cash to one of the “big four” banks, there are a number of players worth considering, including Triodos Bank, Charity Bank and Ecology building society. All offer savings accounts, while Triodos also has a current account which can be managed online and via the mobile app, but carries a £3 monthly fee. Charity Bank lends to charities and social enterprises. It has a one-year fixed-rate account paying 1.3% and a 33-day notice cash Isa at 1.07%. To coincide with Good Money Week (formerly National Ethical Investment Week), running until 5 October, the bank has launched a Follow the Money campaign, which has seen 38 charities and social enterprises open their doors so savers can see where and how their money is being used. These include Holne Community Shop &amp; Tea Room in Dartmoor national park in Devon. When the shop and tearoom faced closure, the community united to save what was an important social hub. They formed a committee and now it is run for the benefit of the wider community. In 2014, the social enterprise received a £75,000 loan from Charity Bank to help buy the premises. As secretary Gilly Simpson says: “It has proved an invaluable resource. Not only do tourists walking or cycling in the park flock to the tea room, it also provides a great meeting place. It’s a lifeline for those who might otherwise struggle with loneliness and isolation.” If you are interested in a green or ethical slant, the Ethex platform has helped raise millions for social businesses, charities and community organisations. Its website lists several schemes, including share offers from Stockwood Community Benefit Society, which operates a farm and business park in Worcestershire and is targeting a potential 5% return for investors; and from Bristol’s Exchange, which has launched a campaign to raise £250,000 to turn the premises into the city’s first community-owned live music venue, and is offering rewards and a potential 3% return.",Ethical money; Investments; Money; UK news; Banking; Business,Money
2018-10-20T11:21:28Z,£7m crowdfunding bid for Orkney tidal energy turbine launches,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/20/7m-crowdfunding-bid-for-orkney-tidal-energy-turbine-launches,"A “green” investment that pays 12% interest and involves putting your money into a major tidal energy project was launched this week. But that high rate indicates this is a great deal riskier than putting your money into a high street savings account, with no compensation if things go wrong. So this is not one for the risk-averse. Launched by ethical investment platform Abundance, the scheme involves a company called Orbital Marine Power that is looking to raise £7m to fund construction of the UK’s first floating tidal stream turbine to go into commercial production. Those who invest would be buying debentures, which are like IOUs issued by companies. The investment has a 30-month term and offers 12% interest a year before tax, which is rolled up and paid at maturity in June 2021. The minimum investment is £5. The offer document says that if someone invested £1,000, they would at the end of the term receive £338.02 interest, plus their original capital back. But debentures are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme or the Financial Ombudsman Service, and the document states that “there is no guarantee you will receive any interest, or that your capital will be returned”.",Wave and tidal power; Green economy; Environment; Renewable energy; Energy; Investments; Money; Scotland; UK news,Environment
2020-03-22T14:37:30Z,Church fund chief says coronavirus will renew calls for responsible capitalism,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/22/church-fund-chief-says-coronavirus-will-renew-calls-for-responsible-capitalism,"The ethical investment chief at the Church of England’s investment arm has said the sacrifices made to tackle the coronavirus outbreak will renew calls for “responsible capitalism” and force companies to reconsider issues such as excessive executive pay. Edward Mason, the head of responsible investment for the Church Commissioners, said that while the coronavirus was overwhelming the news agenda it was likely to refocus minds on the collective good and how companies need to play their part. “Some of the post-financial crisis themes we’ve seen around corporate tax, not having excessive executive remuneration, treating people fairly, treating staff fairly – I think all these issues are already part of the public discourse on coronavirus. And I think it’s only going to increase the sort of momentum behind responsible capitalism, because everyone’s making sacrifices at the moment,” he told the Guardian. Mason said the Church Commissioners, which manage an £8.3bn ethical fund on behalf of the Church of England, would also expect firms that receive government support during the Covid-19 outbreak to consider what they could do in return. “If society has been good to a company, it’s incumbent on that company to be a responsible citizen in society and to be generous back. That’s very much part of our philosophy as a church: mutual generosity and intentions towards the common good,” Mason said. Last week the High Pay Centre, a thinktank, called for any bailouts during the coronavirus outbreak to come with social and environment conditions including a cap on chief executive pay at 10 times that of the company’s median worker. In recent years the Church of England has used its shareholdings to criticise companies such as Sports Direct over poor working conditions and BP over its carbon footprint. In the US it has taken aim at Amazon for paying “almost nothing” in taxes and ExxonMobil for failing to disclose emissions reduction targets. It is now pushing Barclays on its climate record. The Church Commissioners have joined a list of influential investors backing a shareholder resolution calling for Barclays to phase out lending to fossil fuel companies. A vote on the measure will take place at the bank’s annual general meeting on 7 May. Barclays has been the top European financier of fossil fuels in the last four years, according to figures compiled by campaigners including the Rainforest Action Network. They also showed that the London-based bank was the largest financier of Arctic oil and gas last year. Mason said he expected companies to make further progress in battling the climate crisis despite the coronavirus outbreak. “We’re exceptionally key that this should remain on the agenda” he said. “Climate change is by far our highest priority, it is the biggest ethical issue that concerns our stakeholders in the wider church, and also poses the greatest systemic risk to our portfolio.” This year the Church Commissioners will start assessing whether companies in their investment portfolio – including oil producers and airlines – are aligned with the Paris climate agreement, which aims to keep global temperatures from rising by more than 2C. The investment arm, which says it aims to engage with polluters in an effort to change their behaviour, has pledged to divest from laggard companies by 2023. The C of E holds stakes in oil firms including Shell, BP and Exxon Mobil. “There’s a lot resting on companies and we’re hopeful that companies will rise to the challenge … and once the immediate crisis is over, we’ll be ready to challenge companies, as appropriate, as well,” Mason said.",Ethical business; Executive pay and bonuses; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Anglicanism; Investing; Financial sector; Coronavirus; Business; UK news,Business
2020-01-24T06:16:01Z,Australian who helped Peter Thiel bankrupt Gawker sues ex-business partner,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/24/australian-who-helped-peter-thiel-bankrupt-gawker-sues-ex-business-partner,"The Australian man who helped tech billionaire Peter Thiel bankrupt the news website Gawker by funding a defamation case brought by pro wrestler Hulk Hogan has launched legal action against his former business partner. Aron D’Souza, who was dubbed “Mr A” in media coverage of the Gawker case, is suing his former business partner, Phillip Kingston, and two tax-haven companies for allegedly failing to pay $2m due to him after he sold out of financial services company Sargon Capital. D’Souza and Kingston founded Sargon in 2015 with grand plans to revolutionise superannuation and other financial services through the use of technology, and recruited a star-studded board that includes former Crown Resorts chairman Rob Rankin and Labor right powerbroker Stephen Conroy in preparation for a hoped-for float on the stock exchange that would value the company at $1bn. However, in July D’Souza quit the Sargon board. This followed an agreement struck in January last year that he would sell his Sargon shares – a deal that is at the heart of a lawsuit filed by a company controlled by D’Souza in the Victorian supreme court on Wednesday. D’Souza’s court filings do not reveal who was to buy his stake in Sargon or what they were to pay for it, but in them he alleges the deal was guaranteed by Kingston personally, as well as by a Hong Kong company called Trimantium, which company documents show Kingston owns and controls, and a British Virgin Islands company called Explosive Growth. Part of the agreement was that his company would receive a series of “deferred” payments, D’Souza claims. He claims two payments due in November and December and totalling $2m were not paid and has asked the court to order Kingston, Trimantium and Explosive Growth to hand over the money, plus interest calculated at 8% a year. Kingston said via a spokeswoman: “I am surprised to hear this and will need to look into it further.” D’Souza has been contacted for comment through his lawyer, Corrs Chambers Westgarth partner Matthew Critchley, who said his client was travelling. The Oxford-educated D’Souza shot to prominence in 2018 when Buzzfeed reported he was the mastermind of Thiel’s elaborate plot to destroy Gawker by funding Hogan’s defamation lawsuit. Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, launched the lawsuit in Florida in 2012 over Gawker’s publication of parts of a video of him having sex with the then-wife of his friend, radio personality Bubba the Love Sponge. In 2016, a jury awarded Hogan US$140m. Gawker filed for bankruptcy protection because it could not afford to lodge a US$50m appeal bond. Most of Gawker’s assets were bought by Univision, but the main Gawker website was shut down. Thiel, a venture capitalist and Facebook board member who is a supporter of Donald Trump, secretly funded the Hogan lawsuit to the tune of US$10m. The website had long been a critic of Thiel, venture capitalism and the culture of Silicon Valley, and in 2007 published a piece headlined “Peter Thiel is totally gay, people”. D’Souza came up with the idea of funding a lawsuit against Gawker and acted as a conduit between Thiel and the lawyer who ran the case, Charles Harder, Buzzfeed reported. He is also the co-founder, with Kingston, of Good Super, a retail super fund which offers ethical investment options that screen out companies involved in “tobacco, weapons and armaments, gambling, alcohol, pornography and human rights abuses” and, according to his website, is honorary consul of the Republic of Moldova. His biggest venture with Kingston was Sargon, which has steadily gobbled up other financial services companies since it was founded in 2015. In April last year Sargon reportedly hired UBS and Deutsche Bank to help it prepare for a stock market float by the end of the year. However, the company is yet to have an initial public offering. Accounts filed with the corporate regulator show that in the 2017-18 financial year it declared a loss of $5.6m, down from $18.7m the previous year.",Business; Peter Thiel; Gawker Media; Crown Resorts; Media; Technology; Business; Australia news; Digital media,Australia news
2019-11-18T19:19:26Z,"G4S has no place on ethical index, London Stock Exchange told",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/18/london-stock-exchange-criticised-for-including-g4s-on-ethical-index,"Human rights campaigners have criticised the London Stock Exchange Group for including G4S on ethical investment indices, after the British security company was accused of contributing to human rights violations. The FTSE4Good index, run by the London Stock Exchange Group’s FTSE Russell subsidiary, has included G4S for the past three years. During that time, G4S, one of the world’s largest public sector employers, with 546,000 employees in 90 countries, has been at the centre of multiple controversies over its treatment of workers. In September, it said it will end its involvement in the immigration and asylum sector following a scandal at a detention centre near Gatwick. Norway’s $1.1tn (£850bn) government pension fund last week announced it had excluded shares in G4S from its investment portfolio, after its ethics watchdog found an “unacceptable risk of the company contributing to systematic human rights violations” among workers in the Middle East. On Sunday the Labour party criticised the company following the revelation that a board member helped to set the UK’s minimum wage. Vaidehee Sachdev, a senior research manager at ShareAction, which campaigns on responsible investment, called on FTSE Russell to remove G4S until it showed progress on improving its human rights record. “Even before Norway’s deeply distressing findings, the company’s human rights record was questionable,” she said. “People who want to do good with their money would rightly be horrified to be invested in a company that fails to meet basic human rights standards.” Index providers such as FTSE Russell are highly influential in the investment industry, and so-called ethical indices, which claim to exclude companies on environmental, social or governance grounds, have grown in popularity in recent years. Peter Frankental, Amnesty International UK’s economic affairs programme director, said ethical indices are often “little more than soft corporate PR – reliant on partial and outdated information, rather than anything genuinely independent”. He said: “Norway’s sovereign wealth fund is likely to offer a better assessment of whether G4S is actually doing enough to root out modern forms of slavery from its Gulf supply chains.” FTSE Russell’s largest competitors, including MSCI, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and Deutsche Börse’s Stoxx, do not include G4S on their ethical indices. G4S in September said its inclusion on FTSE4Good highlighted its contribution on the United Nations’ eighth sustainable development goal, which calls for “immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking”, and to “protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers”. However, Norway’s Council of Ethics found that some of G4S’s employment practices were indicators of forced labour, a type of modern slavery, under the conventions of the UN International Labour Organisation. Migrant workers mainly from India, Pakistan and Nepal – working in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates – were routinely subjected to misinformation about working conditions, restrictions on freedom of movement and “debt bondage” from high recruitment fees, the council found. G4S last week said it had investigated the council’s findings and that it was making progress on improving its employment practices.

2019-07-06T07:34:53Z,Solar power: how investing can help to change lives,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jul/06/ethical-investing-energise-africa-a-solar-scheme-with-the-power-to-change-lives,"Fight the climate crisis and earn a return of 5% at the same time, plus enjoy a guarantee on your investment. That’s the offer from an ethical investment scheme that allows people to put money into companies providing African families with access to clean, affordable solar energy. It’s notable that this scheme is supported by UK aid money from the Department for International Development (DfID), and offers a guarantee, although this only covers the first £100 of capital invested and applies to first-time investors. Energise Africa enables ordinary people to invest in bonds issued by solar companies, allowing them to provide “life-changing” solar home systems to low-income families in countries such as Kenya, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzania. With a minimum investment of £50 and expected annual returns that have in the past typically ranged from 5% to 7%, this is a potentially straightforward and accessible way for people to make sure their money is doing some good. And the guarantee on offer to new investors will definitely provide reassurance. However, above and beyond that guarantee, your capital is at risk, and the returns are not guaranteed. In the worst-case scenario, if there is some kind of disaster, crisis or bankruptcy, you could lose some or all of your capital and would not be able to get redress from the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme or complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service. So this is not going to be for everyone. Energise Africa was launched in 2017 and is the result of a link-up between Ethex, a UK-based ethical investment platform, and Lendahand, a Dutch-based crowdfunding platform. It boasts a community of more than 1,800 investors and partners who have so far raised more than £8.9m. The platform says it has successfully closed more than 60 fundraising projects, which means its investors have helped about 350,000 people to access affordable, clean energy. An estimated 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa live without access to electricity. Many use traditional energy sources such as kerosene lamps, candles and batteries but these can be dangerous as well as costly. Having a solar system can allow children to read and study in the evening, and enable a person to install a fridge so they can sell cold drinks. In terms of the investment offer, this involves putting money into unsecured bonds that are not listed on a public market. Essentially, you are lending money to businesses that sell small solar home systems to African families, with a typical term of two to three years. At the time of writing, there were two projects on the Energise Africa website open for investment: both two-year bonds with an expected interest rate of 5% a year. The company behind the two-year product is Cambridge-based Azuri, which has set an investment target of £200,000. The company says each £200 invested will enable one Kenyan family to buy an Azuri SolarPlus home system in affordable instalments. Meanwhile, the firm behind the other bond is Sollatek, based in Mombasa, Kenya, which is seeking to raise £65,000. At the moment, all first-time Energise Africa customers are being offered a guarantee on the capital they invest, up to £100 in one project. In the event of the issuing company defaulting on its repayments, the guarantee would be called on to repay the investor their £100. Assuming there is no call on the facility, the funds will be available to provide a guarantee to other first-time investors once the bond has been fully redeemed. Energise Africa is supported by UK aid money, Virgin Unite (the nonprofit foundation of the Virgin Group), the Swiss-based Good Energies Foundation, and P4G",Investments; Money; Ethical money; UK news; Africa; World news; Energy industry; Solar power; Energy; Business; Environment; Renewable energy,Money
2019-06-20T23:01:29Z,Major global investor drops US firms deemed climate crisis laggards,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/21/us-climate-crisis-legal-and-general-investment-management,"An ethical investment operation by the UK’s largest asset manager has dumped shares in a string of US companies it has deemed climate crisis laggards, including oil giant ExxonMobil and insurer Metlife. Legal and General Investment Management (LGIM) said it had cut five companies – ExxonMobil, Metlife, Spam maker Hormel Foods, US retailer Kroger and Korean Electric Power Corporation – from its umbrella of ethical investment funds worth a total of £5bn. LGIM added the climate laggards to a list which already includes China Construction Bank, carmaker Subaru, Japan Post Holdings, Canadian retailer Loblaw, US food and service conglomerate Sysco Corporation and Russian oil giant Rosneft, which is part-owned by BP. The asset manager monitors companies across six major sectors: oil and gas; mining; electric utilities; carmakers; food retailers; and finance. Meryam Omi, head of responsible investment at LGIM, said investor engagement with companies can be “a powerful tool” if there are “consequences”. L&amp;G retains shareholdings in the blacklisted companies at other funds in its £1tn investment empire and will now use those shares to vote against board appointments at the named and shamed businesses. “Talks without action are no longer fit for purpose given the urgency to address climate change,” she said. “This is no fad. The world is truly in the midst of a climate emergency, which could have drastic consequences for markets, companies and, therefore, our clients’ assets.” LGIM expects all companies to disclose their exposure to the climate crisis and set targets for reducing the carbon-intensity of their operations as part of its 2016 climate impact pledge. The investment firm warned earlier this year that the world is facing “a climate catastrophe” unless companies act, and last year said it voted against a record number of boards which are not doing enough. Omi said the investor is doing “a huge amount” to urge clients to follow the example of its ethical funds by divesting from carbon-intensive companies to protect against the financial risk of climate breakdown. She said there is also a “powerful opportunity” for investors which remain shareholders of polluting companies to use their voting power to help change the organisation. The money manager said US companies have proved the most challenging to engage with on climate concerns. LGIM said the nation is divided between companies firmly committed to tackling climate issues, and a disproportionate number of companies among the lowest-scoring of its report. Donald Trump has vowed to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, in contrast to many US states and cities which are making strides in holding fossil fuel companies to account for the climate crisis. Overall, LGIM believes there is less willingness among US companies to make even incremental changes because they are not under the same pressure to take climate action because it is not expected by US investors. ExxonMobil, the world’s largest listed oil company, emerged as the leading climate laggard in this year’s tally after refusing to report its own carbon emissions or set targets to reduce them. Omi said these measures are the minimum LGIM would like to see from a company “with a huge footprint”. Meanwhile, LGIM praised US oil company Occidental Petroleum which was reinstated as an investment candidate after landing on the laggard list last year. The report said Occidental has shown “a step change” in its climate engagement by measuring and disclosing its total carbon emissions and announcing plans to set emissions targets by the end of the year. Occidental also plans to spend $36bn (£32bn) to buy a shale oil company, Anadarko, in one of the largest US shale deals of recent years. LGIM said it plans to escalate its climate criteria in the years ahead.",Legal and General; Business; ExxonMobil; Climate crisis; World news; Environment; Oil; Oil and gas companies; UK news; US news,Business
2020-01-31T19:00:54Z,The dilemma of ethical consumption: how much are your ethics worth to you? | Matt Beard,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/01/the-dilemma-of-ethical-consumption-how-much-are-your-ethics-worth-to-you,"In the lead-up to a recent buck’s party, the group chat turned to the age-old question: will there be strippers? After some back and forth (for the record, I was opposed), the groom-to-be stepped in with the veto. “No strippers!” he declared. His reasoning demonstrated a remarkable level of self-knowledge. He explained that he was planning on the weekend being filled with inhibition-reducing substances and didn’t trust his addled self to make smart decisions. In doing so, he gave voice to a basic moral principle: better to avoid temptation than to overcome it. From Mufasa to Gandalf – and the Lord’s Prayer – we’re told that while it’s good to be able to resist vice when it calls to us, there’s wisdom in arranging our lives in a way that minimises our exposure to vice altogether. Unfortunately, that advice is nearly impossible to follow when it comes to participating in the market. Increasingly our decisions around what we buy come with a trade-off: the more sustainable, ethical, fair trade option or the cheaper, potentially dodgier one. Take an easy example: eggs. Do you want to buy them from the farms that give the chooks the best quality of life (comparably speaking)? Free range, organic and more than twice the price of the quick-and-dirty caged eggs stashed at the bottom of the shelves. For many of us, this is a fairly straightforward choice – the price to put our money where our morals are is relatively low, though even here, the lower your budget, the harder the ethical choice becomes. What happens when we increase the costs? If we stop thinking with our stomachs, the problems get even larger. I recently informed my financial planner that I wanted to move my superannuation to an ethical investment fund. He did his job and showed me the comparison. If fees and returns for each fund performed as they had been, in 30 years’ time my superannuation would be $300,000 worse off investing in an ethical fund. Lead us not into temptation indeed. There are a few perversities here. The most galling to me is that pitting money against morality is a regressive dilemma. The people who can most afford to pay their ethical way are the uber rich; those battling against the poverty line don’t have the option but to become complicit in animal wellbeing issues and clothing made in questionable conditions. They certainly can’t justify moving to a higher-fee fund just because it doesn’t invest in coal or tobacco. There seems to be something uniquely cruel about creating a system that determines ethical seriousness by purchasing behaviour, thereby stigmatising the poor and lightening the load on the wealthy. This only becomes more egregious when you consider the various ways in which wealth is accumulated under capitalism – often on the backs of the same workers who can’t afford not to be complicit in the ethical missteps that often end up lining the pockets of the very same elites who can then afford a clean conscience. However, the choice remains difficult even for those who ostensibly can afford to take the financial hit for their ethics. It’s easy to compare the immediate, measurable and tangible cost difference of two products. Making a judgement regarding the vague, unquantifiable moral value of not investing in unethical practices or investing in exemplary ones is ambiguous. There’s no obvious benefit, and thanks to the anonymity of the global market, we usually don’t see the harms inherent in the products we’re being offered. That’s a recipe for rationalising the choice that’s better for us and ours, no matter what the costs are to anonymous people, animals and ecosystems. There appears to be little out for those wanting to be ethical consumers on a budget. Compromises and trade-offs will need to be made. You’ll likely need to benefit from practices that don’t align with what you think is right. However, the lie at the heart of the ethical consumption movement is to tell you this is your fault. It’s not. It’s the fault of a much larger system offering you choices that, in many cases, you simply shouldn’t be permitted to make. I don’t want to be given the choice between forfeiting hundreds of thousands of dollars and compromising on my values. I don’t want to be offered the opportunity to buy clothes that are cheaper for me because disempowered workers paid the price in underpayment and subjugation. It’s too easy to justify the worse option. It’s too easy to be tempted. Thinking this way has reframed slightly the way I think about ethical consumption. In the past, I’ve assumed the appropriate emotion to accompany making a good moral purchase is pride. Recently, I’ve started to feel like resentment is a more accurate – and more motivating – emotion. I resent that the same store from which I’m buying free range eggs is profiting not only from my ethical purchase but from the choice to render others complicit in animal cruelty. I resent that superannuation companies, refusing to divest from unethical and harmful products, are using the promise of a greater retirement fund and more money to pass on to future generations as bribes to make me compromise on my morality. I can’t be proud participating in a system where my ability to make ethical choices is based more on my bank balance than my character. When the cheapest product, available to rich and poor alike, can also be purchased with a clean conscience? That’s when I think we’ll be able to take pride in our purchases. • Matt Beard is an Australian moral philosopher, fellow at The Ethics Centre and a regular writer on philosophy and ethics",Ethics; Consumer affairs; Ethical and green living,Opinion
2019-12-08T09:00:36Z,Market debut for world’s biggest polluter must be a rallying cry for climate action,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/08/saudi-aramco-flotation-biggest-polluter-climate-action,"In less than a week the most valuable company in history will make its debut on a publicly traded market. Saudi Aramco is both the most profitable and the most polluting company of all time. Its looming $1.7tn (£1.3tn) market listing is also evidence of the gaping chasm between Europe’s growing climate movement and the carbon addiction the rest of the world just cannot kick. A year that has seen the most determined green investor activism, fossil fuel divestments and climbing climate targets will end with the largest single fossil-fuel binge in investment history. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman put in motion plans to offer international investors the opportunity to own a piece of the world’s biggest oil company in 2016, only months after governments in Paris had agreed plans to tackle the climate crisis. Nonetheless, the world’s biggest investors, from Wall Street to the largest financial centres in Europe and Asia, still clamoured for a chance to help bring Aramco to market. The scale of the world’s biggest IPO has since been scaled back in line with a waning western appetite for a company indelibly linked to the Saudi regime and its flaring geopolitical tensions. When Aramco makes its debut later this month, it will be on the local Riyadh stock exchange, for the dubious benefit of investors based almost exclusively in the Middle East. The plans for a second, international, listing are gone, as is the hope of a $2tn valuation, but Aramco’s failure to live up to Prince Mohammed’s desire for a place in the global investment community should not be chalked up as a victory for ethical investment. Despite the cold feet of western banks, the float still attracted investor interest equating to more than five times the number of shares on offer. Aramco will still raise $25bn for the Saudi government, breaking the record set by China’s online retail giant Alibaba. It will also topple Apple – worth more than $1tn – from its position as the world’s most valuable public company. Its market capitalisation will tower above the combined value of the next five largest oil companies. Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, has predicted that a $2tn valuation could still be on the cards once trading begins, and with Opec’s new deal to buoy global oil prices next year. He may be right. The centuries-old bonds which bind global capitalism to carbon show little sign of fraying as the world’s fastest-growing economies remain keen to continue investing in oil, coal and gas. Even investors wary of a future decline in demand are keenly aware that Saudi oil is some of the easiest and cheapest to produce in the world. If their investment horizons were to stretch to the day the world uses its last barrel of oil, that barrel would most likely be Saudi. The funds flowing into the single biggest contributor to the climate crisis may not come from European investors, but this doesn’t mean Aramco’s move away from the west should not be ignored. The limited listing effectively puts the world’s most polluting company beyond the reach of green campaigners, activist investors and the ESG (environmental, social and governance) codes followed by European banks. Aramco will not face political pressure from its state owners, or even from its neighbours in the region. The threat of divestment is meaningless for Aramco. This is no reason to give up on the strides made in Europe. It is a reminder that these hard-won standards must gain traction beyond Europe’s financial centres, too. In the same way that the world’s rapidly warming atmosphere is blind to the geographic provenance of carbon emissions, the greening of the financial system needs to be global too. Saudi Aramco’s market triumph may be more muted than planned, but it is still a deafening warning about tackling the climate crisis. Virgin Trains terminates here Like the high street after Woolworths, or the package holiday after Thomas Cook, rail travel will survive the passing of Virgin Trains this weekend; but it will be shaken nonetheless. The great disruptor, as Sir Richard Branson styled his brand, had become part of the furniture after 22 years. It was the first and only firm to run Britain’s main intercity service since privatisation. Now, though, Virgin has been ejected in favour of First Trenitalia, some seven years after rival FirstGroup thought it had won the franchise. Instead, in 2012 Virgin – the champion of competition – cried foul and called the lawyers, and has sat prettily ever since on a string of direct contract awards from a befuddled Department for Transport. The ironies do not stop there. Virgin later proved to have overbid to win the east coast franchise, and its default on payments led to it being taken over by the UK state operator, LNER. And the death of Virgin Trains also marks the end of transport firm Stagecoach’s interests in rail, as it follows National Express back to busland. The founding myths of private rail – of the efficiency and flair that would vanquish British Rail’s curled-up sandwiches and associated public sector failings – are still aired. Yet with the handover of West Coast, as few as 7% of domestic journeys will take place on trains operated entirely by private firms. First’s partner Trenitalia is run by the Italian state, and state-owned firms from Germany, France, the Netherlands and beyond have a hand in virtually all British franchises, bar just two operated by First alone. Virgin and Stagecoach extracted more than £600m in dividends. That is money that Labour argues the taxpayer could keep if services were renationalised – and unless the remaining private operations demonstrate a spectacular improvement, the question might increasingly be: why not? Britain gets wealthier, and more divided Britain has for decades lived off its wealth. In some respects this works for the nation, but in many ways it does not. Last week official figures showed that the nation’s wealth grew to a record high in the two years to 2018, adding to strong gains made in the years since the 2008 financial crash and almost uninterrupted increases ever since the 1970s. In the mid-1970s, the UK’s wealth equated to three times national annual income (GDP). By 2008, that ratio had risen to 5.5 times and now it stands at seven times GDP. In the 10 years to 2018, typical household incomes have increased by just 6% in real terms, while typical household wealth has gone up by 18%. The best that can be said for our wealth is that it provides an asset from which to borrow money. There has also been a trend for selling ever-inflating assets to fill the 4-5% shortfall in the UK’s balance of payments each year. However, wealth is pernicious in the way it divides communities and rewards those who would profit from buying assets only to milk them for an income while paying a tax at a rate lower than the equivalent income tax. The emphasis on building up wealth and assets – and if possible extracting an income from them – is also a reflection of the low wage rises on offer to those who make their income from work. The situation has improved over the past couple of years, with a spread of wealth to millions of lower-income workers via their occupational pension schemes. The expansion has happened so rapidly that private pension wealth has become the largest component of overall wealth – marginally bigger than property wealth. To some extent this reflects a slight cooling in the housing market, but an extension of wealth to lower-income groups must be welcome.",Oil; Middle East and north Africa; Oil and gas companies; Energy industry; World news; Saudi Arabia; Virgin Trains; Environment; Business,Business
2018-03-15T07:00:16Z,What to do with those divested billions? The only way is ethics,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/15/what-to-do-with-those-divested-billions-the-only-way-is-ethics,"Divestment has become a trillion-dollar topic in recent years – boycotting companies considered harmful has never been more popular: Israeli exporters, arms makers, and fossil fuel producers, among others. Across the world more than 800 institutions, with total investments valued at $6tn, have committed to divest from fossil fuels. But where do investors put their money instead? Are companies that benefit thriving? In short, is ethical investing making a difference? Definitions of this sector vary, as do monikers – ethical, environmental, sustainable. But they can be broadly categorised as “socially responsible investment”, or SRI. Among the many estimates of the power of private investment, the most plausible is that this kind of investment jumped to 10% of private funds under management in recent years, after slumming along at long-term levels of below 4%. Institutional investors are also getting in on the act: two decades ago about £300m a year was considered “socially responsible” investment; today it is, by one estimate £23bn. And yet this is still a drop in the ocean compared to all global funds under management, estimated at about $85tn (£60tn). Green bond issues are expected to double this year, but will still be less than one percent of the global bond market. Despite being comprehensively overshadowed by conventional investment, however, there is sober but considerable optimism about the future of SRI. Proactive investors – and the wider public conscience – are pushing governments, and in turn regulators, to demand better practices from business – cleaner air, less obesity, reducing use of fossil fuels. “I would not feel comfortable gaining from somebody else’s misery,” explains company owner and private investor Rebecca Hughes. Institutions too are heading in the same direction: nearly 80% of investors across 30 countries told last year’s Schroders’ Global Investor Study that sustainability had become more important to them over the last five years. “While profitability remains the central investment consideration, interest in sustainability is increasing,” said Jessica Ground, Schroders’ global head of stewardship. “But investors also see sustainability and profits as intertwined.” UBS’s Doing well by doing good report claims more than half the UK public would pay more for goods or services with a conscience. Many more people will want better ethical standards, even if they don’t want or can’t afford to pay for them. “It’s in my upbringing: you treat others in the way you’d like to be treated,” says Hughes. More active financial investors are also taking the issues seriously. Several have indices to track the value of shares in companies which are not doing ‘bad’, or actively doing ‘good’. One is Morgan Stanley, whose two environmental, social and governance (ESG) indices – also covering weapons and women’s progress – were worth $62bn by last summer. UBS reckons “impact investing” – where investors actively seek out companies doing good – is a “force to be reckoned with”. One of the key reasons is the other big driver of the sector: shareholders no longer have to choose between their conscience and profits. Hughes’s £170,000 increased in value by 26% last year – notably more than conventional investments. “It started driven by values, it’s now definitely [driven] by value,” says Simon Howard, chief executive of the UK Sustainable Investment Forum. While Richard Mattison, CEO of environmental data firm Trucost, says investors such as pension funds now see such investments as a “no brainer”. Is this sea-change having any effect on the issues that investors want to improve? Shareholders and the wider public have won many causes in recent years – reductions in unsustainable palm oil, reduced packaging, new coal plants ditched, high street shops such as Sports Direct embarrassed over treatment of workers. But some of the biggest winners on the stock markets last year were bêtes noires of ethical investors – tobacco, car makers and aerospace and defence companies. Energy stocks have risen by one third in the last two years. And in November 2017 scientists revealed global carbon dioxide emissions, which drive climate change, reached a record high. However, ever-rising demand to invest in companies pioneering and popularising technologies to create carbon-free energy, reduce waste landfill sites, reduce aircraft noise and other improvements to living standards, should make a considerable difference over time. At the same time, existing companies, across the spectrum, from manufacturers to media, are being forced – by regulators, investors and public opinion – to reconsider how they will do business in 10 or 20 years’ time, especially with regard to carbon emissions. “This is going to reverberate across every part of the economy,” says Andy Howard, Schroders’ head of sustainable research. “This is going to be painful for some [but] there are big opportunities for people who get it right.” In the meantime, says Hughes: “If I’m investing into a company that’s helping the environment, or helping women, I’m happy with that. That’s all you can ask of anyone.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

2019-06-05T06:00:27Z,Climate crisis and antibiotic use could 'sink' fish farming industry – report,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/05/climate-crisis-and-antibiotic-use-could-sink-fish-farming-industry-report,"The climate crisis, drug use and feeding farmed fish with wild stocks risks “sinking” the $230bn (£180bn) aquaculture industry, according to an ethical investment network. Fish farms now surpass wild fisheries as the main provider of seafood on our plates, but combined risks from global heating, excessive use of antibiotics, a dependence on wild stocks for feed, and poor governance threatens the lucrative and fast-growing sector, warned Farm Animal Investment Risk and Return (Fairr), a $12trn-backed network. The aquaculture industry is the world’s fastest-growing food production sector but has recently been hit by governance scandals. In April, US seafood buyers filed a class lawsuit alleging price-fixing by Norwegian salmon producers, following spot raids on fish farms across Europe by European Commission anti-cartel investigators. And in May, a Panorama report named several fish farmers as among those under investigation by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency for alleged misreporting of chemical use. Fairr’s report, Shallow returns?, shows an average growth in aquaculture of almost 6% annually, providing “significant” returns for shareholders, at up to more than 400% over five years. But the investor group warned that much of this expansion is based on high-density farming associated with environmental, social and governance risks. It accused the sector of “limited transparency” on these issues. “Investors should be aware of the sustainability risks in the aquaculture sector before they wade in too deeply,” said Maria Lettini, director of Fairr. “From effluents to emissions, this sector must address significant environmental and public health challenges if it is to prosper over the long term.” Aquaculture is both a significant contributor to emissions and is highly exposed to their impacts, the report said. Farmed marine fish production in south-east Asia, one of the largest aquaculture regions, is expected to drop 30% by 2050 due to rising sea temperatures and acidification of oceans. Farmed salmon and shrimp require fishmeal and fish oil, making the sector highly dependent on rapidly depleting wild fish stock for future growth, the report found. Lettini said: “We thought that farmed fish would save our wild stocks in the oceans, but now it’s coming to the fore that we are using wild-caught fish to feed our farmed fish – and that is causing real problems.” Nearly one fifth of global fisheries production is used for fishmeal and fish oil production, the report found. Sewage and wastewater discharged from fish farms is also associated with toxic algal blooms and polluted drinking water, Lettini said. Last month Norway suffered its worst algal bloom in 30 years, with 8 million salmon killed so far. Algal blooms caused an estimated $800m in damage to the Chilean salmon industry in 2016, killing nearly 27m fish, about 20% of the country’s annual production, according to the report. Hotspots of antibiotic use in fish farming accelerate antimicrobial resistance, the report found, with some countries taking action against importers. In January this year, the US Food and Drug administration denied entry to 26 shipments of Indian shrimp, after detecting banned antibiotics. Another major issue highlighted by the report was the issue of farmed fish slipping out of their pens and coming in contact with native populations. Lettini said: “Farmed fish escape and mix with their organic peers and that is changing the gene pool of wild fish. Changes in DNA have been found and we don’t even know the importance of that yet.” Fairr recommended good management practices, including the use of probiotics to reduce antibiotic use, and alternatives to fishmeal, including feed made from bacteria as well as greater cultivation of mussels and oysters, which do not require fishmeal-based feed.",Fishing industry; Fishing; Environment; Climate science; Climate crisis; Science; Conservation; Food; Marine life; Wildlife,Environment
2019-07-16T06:15:18Z,University green rankings at risk despite climate emergency,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/16/university-green-rankins-risk-despite-climate-emergency,"While young people call for urgent action on the climate emergency, universities are lagging behind, with two-thirds likely to fail their 2020 targets for the reduction of carbon emissions. And academic conferences are partly to blame. Air travel is estimated to be responsible for more than 2% of global human-induced emissions, and lecturers’ flights could be adding significantly to the carbon footprint of many universities, according to transport data provided voluntarily by 67 institutions. According to the 2019 People and Planet University League published on Tuesday, the sector appears to be taking the issues more seriously, increasingly embedding sustainability into its teaching. But still only 49 of 154 institutions are likely to meet the target set by the former funding agency of a 43% reduction of carbon emissions between 2005 and 2020. The table compiled by People and Planet, the student-led network, scores universities out of 100 on criteria such as environmental audits and management systems, the number of staff working on the issues, ethical investment, carbon management, waste and recycling, and sustainable food. The lack of progress is frustrating, says Hannah Smith, the network’s co-director of campaigns and research. “It’s abhorrent to watch universities fail on climate change at a time when people on the frontlines of the impacts are fighting back against heatwaves and forest fires. Universities have a duty to stand with those communities and their students on strike and use their privileged position to act,” she says. Network member Steff Farley, 25, a maths postgraduate student at Loughborough University, adds: “The findings expose the dragging lack of willpower, vision and energy in the sector, which shows disregard for the young climate strikers at schools, colleges and at their own universities.” The table shows that just eight universities have a policy to invest in renewable energy, says Emily Adams, 23, who is studying marine biology and oceanography at the University of Plymouth. “Our universities must now step up to take action to fund a just climate transition,” she adds. This year’s findings on carbon reduction are all the more alarming because this could be the last we hear of them. Under the government’s higher education reforms, universities are no longer obliged to provide data on carbon reduction and other green issues to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa). The Office for Students (OfS) has taken over the role of overseeing the higher education sector from Hefce, the funding council that originally set the targets. An OfS spokeswoman explains: “We are committed to being a low-burden regulator and will therefore only mandate data collection where it is necessary to support our regulatory functions. Currently, the OfS does not have a regulatory need for the data within the estates management record.” She adds: “We fully support Hesa and providers working together to collect data on a voluntary basis where this adds value, but providers will have freedom to opt in to such collections. Where Hesa and providers engage in additional activities beyond those mandated by OfS, this will be subject to additional subscriptions.” People and Planet say that voluntary data collection would be incomplete and that having to pay to access the information could put it beyond the organisation’s reach. Smith says: “It is vexatious that while students of all ages go on strike to build a global movement for an equitable carbon transition, the OfS rows backwards to a time where measuring carbon emissions was deemed superfluous admin.” Universities say that they have struggled to make serious carbon reductions against a background of increased student numbers and campus expansion. In addition, the trend towards collaboration between academics from different countries and the growth of the conference scene has led to more lecturers getting on planes. According to a study of air travel at the University of British Columbia in Canada in 2017, staff from just five departments made 709 air trips over 18 months. The resulting emissions were more than 200 times the building emissions for the whole of the geography department. Follow-up research claimed that there was no identifiable link between air travel and academic productivity. “Universities and the academic community need to drive a fast culture shift away from the kudos of conference presentation tally scores, to one of sharing just as much – if not more – research through innovative and participatory alternatives,” says Smith. “Video-conferencing technology has come a long way.” She identifies three institutions, or “trailblazers”, at the top of the table that show what can be done: the University of Gloucestershire, which comes top, followed closely by Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) and Nottingham Trent University (NTU). New universities dominate the top 10, but some of the Russell Group of research-intensive, older universities have improved their positions. Bristol has risen from 27th in the 2017 table (the last one) to 11th this year, and Newcastle has gone up from 20th to 12th. Oxford, more used to being top of higher-education rankings, is just 45th, but that is an improvement on its previous position of 54th. Cambridge falls from 58th to 67th. Gloucestershire gained marks for divesting all fossil-fuel investments and for already meeting its carbon target, with a 46% emissions reduction since 2005, despite the expansion of its estate. But the university’s commitment goes far beyond its footprint to embrace the “brainprint”, says Alex Ryan, director of sustainability and an academic with national teaching fellow status, who is driving the integration of sustainability across the course portfolio. “From the beginning, our sustainability programme has been geared towards academic innovation,” she explains. “Reducing practical impacts is important but, as a university, our core sustainability legacy is the graduates we send into the world to live and work sustainably. Our curriculum experiences are not about isolated, add-on modules or abstract knowledge without application. The gearshift will come from students learning how to create change for sustainability whatever their profession. We don’t want them to go out into employment as, say, accountants or social workers who just reproduce an unsustainable paradigm. We want system change.” MMU has reduced its carbon emissions by 41% and is aiming to be zero carbon by 2038. One of its most successful initiatives has been a carbon-literacy scheme, where money is put aside to compensate for the emissions generated by international air travel, and then used to train students in tackling climate change. So far, more than 800 students have received the training. NTU has launched a green academy as a permanent department working to engage students in sustainability. It puts on pop-up events, recruits an army of eco-ambassador students, gives green rewards to staff, and even keeps bees and peregrine falcons. Biggest mover, the University of Essex – up from 124 in 2017 to 44 – says a lot has happened since the last table, such as structural changes to put an eight-strong sustainability team at the heart of the estates and campus section. There has been a review of how sustainability is being introduced into different subject areas and the launch of a free sustainability summer school for students. Daisy Malt, its sustainability engagement officer, says the changes have been driven from the top, at vice-chancellor level – and by students. “It’s becoming a big deal, partly because of publicity in the mainstream media and the Blue Planet effect, and students are wanting to be more involved,” she says. Most of those in the bottom 10 are small, specialist institutions. Rose Bruford College in Sidcup, Kent, which has the lowest score, did not comment. The second to last, the University of the Highlands and Islands, said the scores were not a true representation because each of its 13 partner colleges manages its own estate. “We are moving towards a single, partnership-wide carbon-management plan,” said a spokeswoman.",Universities; People & Planet Green League; Higher education; Office for Students; Education; Environment; Students; Carbon footprints; Climate crisis; UK news,Education
2019-01-10T15:51:26Z,UK councils invest £566m in arms firms linked to Yemen war,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/10/uk-councils-invest-566m-in-arms-firms-implicated-in-saudis-yemen-campaign,"More than half a billion pounds of council workers’ pension money has been directly invested by local authorities in arms companies implicated in Saudi Arabia’s military campaign in Yemen, in which thousands of civilians have been killed. Council pension funds have sizeable shareholdings in BAE Systems, Airbus, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman, according to nearly 100 freedom of information requests. Between them, 43 pension funds directly hold shares worth £566m in the five companies and earned more than £18.5m in dividends in 2018, a period in which civilian deaths reportedly surged and a punishing famine took hold. The councils also hold hundreds of millions of pounds in shares in the five companies via pooled investments, which they do not control directly. The holdings mean thousands of local authority staff will have their retirement payouts part-funded by the companies, some of which manufacture arms linked to incidents in which civilians and children were killed. The Guardian gathered the data through the freedom of information website WhatDoTheyKnow.com. The Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle, a member of the parliamentary committee on arms export controls, said some council employees would be upset to learn how their retirement income was being funded. “British council workers’ retirement income is being funded by companies that have been allowed by the British and American governments to make much of their profits by satisfying the appetite of Saudi to kill, maim and starve millions of civilians in Yemen,” he said. Russell-Moyle said some employees at Brighton and Hove city council, within his Brighton Kemptown constituency, would be “furious”. The Campaign Against Arms Trade said council employees’ retirement funds “should be invested in the public good, not in companies that profit from war and conflict”. “These aren’t just numbers on a spreadsheet; the weapons these companies are producing have had a devastating impact,” said Andrew Smith, a CAAT spokesman. “The fighter jets and bombs that are being used in Yemen have played a crucial role in creating the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. “Councils should not be profiteering from the companies that have made these weapons and have been so complicit in the destruction.” The five companies are key suppliers to the Saudi military, which is conducting a campaign in Yemen in which the death toll is estimated at more than 60,000 people, including thousands of civilians, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project. Defence companies routinely point out that such contracts are the result of agreements between their national governments and Saudi Arabia. Lockheed Martin is one of two companies that build the GBU-12 Paveway II missile, and shrapnel fragments found at the site where 40 children on a school bus were killed by a Saudi warplane were reportedly traced back to the US company. Raytheon also makes Paveway missiles at a factory in Glenrothes, Scotland. Shards of bombs found at several sites where civilians died have been traced back to the US-based company, according to CNN. The Saudi air force uses Eurofighter Typhoons, made by a consortium including Airbus and the British company BAE Systems, while Tornado fighter-bombers are manufactured by BAE Systems. The kingdom bought 17% of everything the UK defence contractor sold last year and BAE Systems employs 6,000 people on the ground in Saudi Arabia. The US company Northrop Grumman is also a major contractor to the Saudi military, according to its website, which states it is “heavily involved in the training and development of the Saudi military personnel, most notably providing technical services for the ministry of the national guard”. The council with the largest investment in the five named companies is Lothian, which manages funds worth £7.8bn for staff including Edinburgh city council workers. Its trustees have £85m invested with Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon, deriving £3.8m in revenue from their holdings over the latest 12-month period for which records are available. West Yorkshire pension fund, including Leeds city council and Bradford council employees, had £78.4m of holdings and earned £2m of dividends, spread across BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin and Airbus. Tameside pension fund, including Greater Manchester, has £79m invested with Raytheon and BAE Systems, pulling in £2.65m of dividend income over 12 months. A spokesman for Tameside council referred the Guardian to its ethical investment policy, which states “applying ethical, environmental or any other non-commercial policy either to investments generally or to selecting fund managers would be inconsistent with our legal duties and responsibilities”. The council added that trustees “do not actively invest in or disinvest from companies solely or largely for social, ethical or environmental reasons”. A further 40 local authority pension funds hold similar investments, with values ranging from negligible sums to tens of millions of pounds.

2018-05-19T06:00:20Z,Monzo is ‘one of the best’ ethical current accounts,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/19/monzo-ethical-current-account-app-bank-triodos-ecology-building-society,"App-based bank Monzo has been named a “best buy” for current accounts by a leading ethical body. It joined Triodos Bank, Ecology Building Society, Charity Bank, Co-op Insurance, Ecclesiastical Insurance, Royal London and Aviva in getting the thumbs up from Ethical Consumer. By contrast, major high street banks Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland/NatWest and Santander fared poorly, with none achieving more than five out of 15 in the organisation’s rankings. Ethical Consumer is an independent, not-for-profit co-operative founded in 1989 and based in Manchester. It has developed an ethical rating system that it says is based on research of more than 40,000 firms, brands and products. It has just issued its latest guide to ethical finance and is calling for the big banks to adopt clear policies to avoid lending to “problem sectors” such as coal and tobacco, and provide full transparency about who they lend to and why. While the “vast majority” of companies in the personal finance sector continue to score badly on ethics, according to the organisation, its researchers found ethical alternatives are emerging. One highlight is the current account from Triodos, which has an extensive ethical investment policy and is the only commercial bank in the UK to offer total transparency to savers and investors, publishing details of every organisation it lends to. The Triodos account can be operated online and via an app, and comes with an eco-friendly contactless debit Mastercard. An overdraft of up to £2,000 is available. But the stumbling block for some will be the £3 monthly account fee. Ethical Consumer says Monzo, which is popular among under-30s, is spearheading the growth in app-based banks. It started out offering a prepaid debit card before switching customers to a full current account.",Ethical money; Money; Current accounts; Banks and building societies; Apps; Technology; Banking; Business; Ethical business,Money
2018-09-10T22:00:00Z,Fossil fuel divestment funds rise to $6tn,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/10/fossil-fuel-divestment-funds-rise-to-6tn,"The funds committed to fossil fuel divestment now total more than $6tn (£4.6tn), with almost 1,000 institutional investors having made the pledge, according to a new report. The sell-off of coal, oil and gas investments is led by the insurance industry, with $3tn of funds. But it also now includes the first nation to divest, Ireland, major cities including New York and key medical organisations. Major oil companies such as Shell have this year cited divestment as a material risk to its business. Fossil fuel divestment began on US university campuses in 2011 but now spans 37 nations around the world. Supporters of divestment say existing fossil fuel resources are already far greater than can be burned without causing catastrophic climate change and that exploring for and producing more fossil fuels is therefore morally wrong. They also say fossil fuel companies are risky investments as global action on emissions gets tougher. Some investors argue that remaining as shareholders and persuading fossil fuel companies to change can be more effective. However, another new report finds this approach has not delivered any significant change to date. The new divestment report, by Arabella Advisors, calculates that investors with $6.2tn in assets under management have committed to divest from fossil fuels, up from $5.2tn in the previous report in 2016. “I commend the divestment movement for its incredible progress,” said Mary Robinson, former UN high commissioner on human rights and former president of Ireland. Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York City, and Sadiq Khan, mayor of London, which is in the process of divesting, said in a joint article for the Guardian: “We must use our economic might to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Taking this kind of action now could help us make a crucial difference to the people we represent and the future of our planet. Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of GMO, one of the world’s most influential asset management companies, said the financial case for divestment was compelling. “Investors with long-term horizons should avoid oil stocks on investment grounds. They face a sustained headwind. Ethical arguments for divestments are simply not necessary. They are a pure bonus,” he said. Another new report, from Genus Capital Management in Canada, said its fossil free fund had outperformed a benchmark of standard stock market indices by almost 2% per year over the last five years. The company’s Fossil Free CanGlobe Equity Fund is a mix of Canadian and global stocks. “At the five-year mark, we can conclusively say: divesting from fossil fuels pays,” said CEO Wayne Wachell. The Arabella Advisors report noted that the American Medical Association (AMA) and the UK’s Royal College of General Practitioners had both divested. “It is unwise to own fossil fuels companies long-term and the products of these companies are harmful to human health by producing dangerous air pollution and contributing to global climate change,” said Dr Todd Sack at the AMA. Divestment appears to be concerning oil and gas majors. In Shell’s last annual report it states: “It could have a material adverse effect on the price of our securities and our ability to access equity capital markets.” Furthermore, the World Bank Group has committed to stopping funding oil and gas development and major insurers including Swiss Re have decided to stop underwriting coal projects. The report on investor engagement on with fossil fuel companies, from shareholder advocacy group As You Sow, found that 160 climate change shareholder resolutions were filed at 24 US oil and gas companies between 2012 and 2018. However, none of the companies have adopted plans or targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels and most are investing to maintain or expand production. “The oil and gas sector has not stepped up to address the growing risks to their companies, the broader economy, and our planet,” said Andrew Behar, As You Sow CEO. The call for ethical investment was backed by Pope Francis in June 2018, when he addressed the heads of oil companies. He said “disturbing and a cause for real concern” that carbon emissions were still rising and added: “Even more worrying is the continued search for new fossil fuel reserves, whereas the Paris agreement clearly urged keeping most fossil fuels underground.” Ellen Dorsey, at the philanthropic Wallace Global Fund, said the pressure to divest would continue. “Today, our movement pledges to increase divested global assets to $10tn by 2020.” She said investing in clean energy was as important as pulling funds from polluting firms: “Investors should also commit at least 5% of their portfolio to climate solutions to help rapidly scale to 100% renewable energy and universal energy access.” Robinson backed the clean investment call: “This is what climate justice requires.”",Fossil fuel divestment; Fossil fuels; Climate crisis; Energy; Environment,Environment
2018-05-17T15:49:49Z,Financial giant's £50m 'Girl Fund' to back firms with good gender balance,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/17/financial-giants-50m-girl-fund-to-back-firms-with-good-gender-balance,"One of Britain’s biggest investment firms is taking on gender inequality by launching the first UK fund to prioritise investing in companies where women are well represented at all levels. Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM), which manages £983bn of assets, said the new fund – into which the firm has ploughed £50m of its own money – “aims to empower investors to make a difference to the companies in which they invest and wider society”. The scale of the gender pay gap across the British economy has been exposed this year by a government requirement that all companies and public bodies with more than 250 employees must publish their wage disparities. The Guardian’s analysis of the 10,014 employers who submitted data by last month’s deadline revealed that almost eight out of 10 paid men more than women. The data showed women were being paid a median hourly rate that, on average, was 9.7% less than their male colleagues received. The L&amp;G fund’s full name is the L&amp;G Future World Gender in Leadership UK Index Fund, although the company has dubbed it “the Girl Fund” for short. It will score and rank blue-chip companies according to four gender diversity measures. It will look at the percentage of women on: the board of directors; at executive level; in management; and across the workforce. Companies are expected to reach a minimum of 30% representation of women in these four measures. L&amp;G said it was considering adding another measure to incorporate data relating to the gender pay gap survey. The fund tracks an LGIM-designed index of around 350 of the UK’s largest companies and will allocate more to firms that have achieved higher levels of gender diversity, with the aim of driving up standards in this area. L&amp;G said it would engage with low-scoring companies to discuss how they could improve their gender diversity. Helena Morrissey, the head of personal investing at LGIM and one of the highest-profile women working in the City, said gender inequality “is one of the key issues of our time – and one that generates so much frustration”. She added: “Rather than feeling trapped or despondent, let’s do something about it. I’m excited about the launch of the Girl Fund, which empowers us all to use our money to help companies to progress. When we invest in the success of women, we are investing in the success of business.” The fund is open to small investors with as little as £30 a month to invest. While it might appeal to some of the same people attracted to ethical investment, a number of the companies on the list could raise hackles among responsible investors. As of this week, the index’s top 10 holdings included oil giants Royal Dutch Shell and BP, the largest tobacco company in the world, British American Tobacco, global bank HSBC and the drinks company Diageo.",Legal and General; Women in the boardroom; Business; Gender; UK news; Insurance industry,Business

Really? Is that really a serious question? Once in power is Corbyn really going to set about singlehandedly dismantling a global financial system? Yet Behr wants to know if that’s Corbyn’s ultimate goal. Should we ask if Theresa May’s ultimate goal is fascism? She hasn’t ruled it out, you know. It’s quite clear that Corbyn wants a form of social democracy, but Behr is not sure if Corbyn wants something more extreme. If only there was some kind of manifesto that laid out Labour’s plans and policies for how they would govern? Oh well, we may never know until we’re in the gulag. Joe Carlisle Sheffield • Once again Rafael Behr’s arrow strikes the heart of the matter when he outs the “capisceptics” who sneer at capitalism while enjoying its material bounty. Marxism v capitalism is the past. In the real world, investors, entrepreneurs, managers, customers and staff care as much about other values as they do about money. The foundations of a future in which measures of social and environmental achievement sit alongside profit are already being built, for example by ethical investment funding and triple-bottom-line company accountancy. The politics of the future needs to build on these foundations.

If that sounds like you, ethical Triodos Bank is offering the chance to put money into projects paying between 5% and 7% interest a year. However, there are risks. Triodos was founded in the Netherlands and set up an office in the UK in 1995. It recently won the endorsement of McMafia star James Norton – he revealed last month that he had moved his current account from US giant Citibank to Triodos – while actor Sir Mark Rylance has been with it for many years. Now it has unveiled an ethical investment website: triodoscrowdfunding.co.uk. There are similar sites already out there, including Ethex and Abundance, though Triodos says it is the first UK bank to launch such a platform. It will allow people to invest directly in bonds or equity issued by charities or businesses “that have been extensively screened by Triodos for social and environmental impact, the viability of their business model and the credibility of the management team”. The first two bond offers are: • Mendip Renewables, which aims to raise £1.8m by the end of March to take a 5MW operational solar farm in Somerset into community ownership. Triodos says investors can earn 5% a year, increasing in line with the annual retail price index, repayable over 17 years. • Rendesco, which wants to raise £5.5m to develop green energy from ground source heat pumps, aims to pay 7% a year over seven years.

2018-09-12T09:59:52Z,The Lib Dems can heal Britain's economic divide – here's how | Vince Cable,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/12/wealth-inequality-liberal-democrats-economic-reform,"Much of the anger in today’s politics stems from an ongoing stagnation in living standards, coupled with the sight of a small minority becoming infinitely richer. Britain is one of the most unequal societies in Europe, where success increasingly depends on where you live and who your parents are. Forty-four per cent of UK wealth is owned by 10% of households, while just 9% of wealth is owned by the bottom half. This looks set to continue, with more than half of the net increase in wealth between 2010 and 2014 captured by the top decile of households. Yet although wealth inequality is twice as great as income inequality, which has on some measures actually fallen slightly in recent years, it has strangely received far less attention. Of course, expectations of a better life cannot be met without wealth creation. And this needs investment and technological progress through innovation, which in turn requires rewards for the risk-taking entrepreneurs who make it happen. In other words, it is far easier to create a fairer society when the size of the pie is growing. That is why my party recently set out proposals to replace business rates with a far more investment-friendly land value tax. But what particularly frustrates about wealth inequality in Britain is that it is not obviously the result of productive activity, and has widened primarily thanks to asset price inflation, especially that of property. And this inequality is now so deeply rooted that relying on the doubtful existence of a trickle down effect is no longer enough, if indeed it ever was. Britain’s wealth gap entrenches power and privilege both between and within generations, by generating additional income for asset owners while restricting opportunities for those with little or no wealth. Through gifts and inheritances, these inequalities are passed down to future generations. Those without wealth struggle to acquire property, fund education and training, deal with unexpected income shocks, or pursue their own business and creative ideas. Worse still, wealth inequality is likely to worsen in the coming years due to weak wage growth, rising household debt, automation and falling rates of home ownership and saving. Meanwhile, the money being passed down through inheritances to a lucky minority is projected to grow. We must demand a better future for Britain. If we want to create a society where everyone has the chance to succeed, we need to give people the skills and resources they need and create a more level playing field. That in turn requires tackling inequality through policies that promote a fairer distribution of wealth. That is why the Liberal Democrats have today put forward a bold set of proposals to give everyone a stake in our economy, which will be debated by party members at our autumn conference in Brighton next week. They follow closely on the work of the thinktanks The Resolution Foundation and the Institute for Public Policy Research, which have reached similar conclusions on the policies needed to address Britain’s deep economic divides. They recognise the need for the country to have a serious conversation about tax; something Boris Johnson, with his thoughtless calls for Trump-style tax cuts, is desperate to avoid. To start with, we would overhaul inheritance tax by taxing recipients – rather than givers – on all large gifts they receive, not just those they inherit. Each person would have a generous £250,000 tax-free lifetime allowance, above which income tax rates would apply. This would close a major loophole that allows people to hand down wealth entirely untaxed if the transfer is made more than seven years before death. It would mean that unearned gifts are taxed at the same rate as earned income from employment. This principle – taxing wealth and work in the same way – is at the core of our proposals. We would also tax capital gains at income tax rates, and abolish separate tax-free allowances for both capital gains and dividends. All income, be it from employment or wealth, would be eligible for the personal allowance, so that those who depend solely on income from assets would not be unfairly penalised. These changes would also remove the existing incentive for the well-off to shift employment income into other forms – such as capital gains or dividends – to minimise their tax bills. Another area in urgent need of reform is pension tax relief. Not only does it cost the government £41bn annually, but the existing system of relief is deeply regressive, with 63% of all relief going to the top 15% of taxpayers. We would rebalance it by introducing a flat rate of relief on pension contributions, encouraging lower earners to save for their retirement while cutting tax breaks for the richest. We would also limit the tax-free lump sum people can withdraw from their pension pots, restricting it for those with the largest pots while leaving over three-quarters of pensioners unaffected. These reforms would ensure that Britain’s wealth is taxed more equitably, thus promoting a fairer distribution of wealth. Our conservative estimate is that they would raise £15bn per year, which we would put to work by boosting spending on public services, launching an ambitious programme of lifelong learning and creating a citizens’ wealth fund to invest on behalf of the country. As is now painfully clear, cuts to the essential public services we all rely on have gone too far, resulting in falling levels of service and difficulties in recruiting staff. An ageing population risks worsening the situation in decades to come. We would therefore devote a share of the revenue raised from higher wealth taxation to better fund our essential public services. Secondly, Britain’s workers risk being left behind by our changing economy if they aren’t equipped with the skills and knowledge needed to flourish in the future workplace. We believe that an ambitious programme of lifelong learning – funded in part by wealth taxation – is the only solution, with people empowered to improve their skills throughout their careers through publicly funded accounts. Last but not least, the citizens’ wealth fund, established using a share of the revenue raised, would enable the country as a whole to benefit from the returns to investment typically only available to the wealthy by investing in stocks, bonds and other assets. To ensure its independence, the fund would be kept at arm’s length from government and run by professional fund managers, with robust accountability measures and a strong emphasis on sustainable and ethical investment. Combined, these reforms would go a long way in turning fairness and opportunity from mere catchwords into a genuine reflection of people’s everyday lives. • Vince Cable is leader of the Liberal Democrats",Inequality; Liberal Democrats; Politics; Money; Property; Tax; Society; Business; Economics; Investments; Pensions,Opinion
2018-04-30T22:12:29Z,Bill McKibben: 'There’s clearly money to be made from sun and wind',https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/01/bill-mckibben-profit-renewables-coal-reef,"After almost three decades of environmental activism, Bill McKibben has become the Earth’s investment broker. “There’s no way at this point to solve [climate change] one person at a time,” McKibben told Guardian Australia. The author and founder of 350.org is at the start of an Australian tour, speaking with councils and unions, banks and superannuation funds – anyone with serious cash to invest – about backing an aggressive shift to renewable power sources. What started as a campaign for ethical investment, a push for divestment from fossil fuels, has now become in part a pitch to capitalists that there is money to be made from backing renewables. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “When we started the divestment stuff six years ago, I was operating entirely on moral grounds,” McKibben said. “But it quickly became apparent that it was a much more financially savvy idea than we’d given ourselves credit for. Anyone who five years ago did it made out like bandits.” On Tuesday, McKibben will launch a report by 350.org, the University of Technology, Sydney, and Future Super, showing 7.7% of Australia’s superannuation savings could fund a full transition to renewables by 2030. McKibben said this was not just an activist’s pipe dream. In New York, the city and state pension funds divested from fossil fuels. Dozens of Australian councils have followed suit. “I’ve been interested to watch the fact that financial types are picking up more quickly what’s happening than political types,” he said. “The solar guys haven’t made their money yet, so they can’t [buy political influence]. But if you’re running a pension fund or you’re running a big investment company, you can’t make any more money out of coal. Its day is done. But there’s clearly money to be made from sun and wind, so that’s where they’re headed.” McKibben has wasted no time in Australia, heading to the country’s two most prominent beachheads. In Newcastle, the world’s largest coal export port, he stood in the shadow of piles and piles of black coal, and met local community groups. “There is a one-to-one relationship between those huge mountains of coal behind us and the fact there are countries that are not going to exist by the end of the century,” he told them. “One is directly related to the other one.” At the weekend he visited the Great Barrier Reef. There he saw two versions of a future he warned about almost three decades ago. The first was a “horrifying” vision of, as he titled his first book, the end of nature – a reef at the northern end that had been effectively “cooked”, as leading reef scientist Terry Hughes described it, during the 2016 marine heatwave. “It was a spot with close to 100% coral mortality, and it was depressing, grey monochrome, drab expanse of, well, of dead life,” McKibben said. “A kilometre away we stopped again. It was only about half dead. And it was a reminder of what a remarkable corner of God’s brain the coral reef is. It was filled with colour and vibrant life. “One doesn’t know whether to be happy whether it remains as alive as it is, or sad that so much of it has already been destroyed.” While McKibben was heading to the reef, news broke that the federal government would fund a $500m “rescue package” for the reef. To those who know the science – that the bleaching and death of corals is demonstrably due to climate change – the commitment was laughable. “To simultaneously promote the world’s biggest coalmine while pretending to care about the world’s largest reef is an acrobatic feat only a cynical politician would attempt,” McKibben said. Back on land at Port Douglas, his reaction to seeing the reef was: “We need to accelerate. “The point is all about pace. We need to push everybody to put up renewables at the pace that’s now possible. Elon Musk demonstrated the pace that’s now possible [with the South Australian Tesla battery project]. Everybody should be trying to operate at that pace. “Everyone knows that 70 years from now we’re going to run this planet on sun and wind, the question is whether we’re going to be running a broken planet. The reef is one of the clearest signs of that breakage. It’s a demonstration of the foolishness of what we’re doing. It’s not like this is some obscure mystery. “It’s important to understand that the reef is not a dead ecosystem. Human beings do not have the right to write it off as an ecosystem, and it remains a miraculous place even if that miracle is now hanging by a thread. It should serve as a reminder for us all that we need to double down on aggressive, aggressive action. “Really the dominant emotion is one of fear that the world won’t rise to the occasion.”",Climate crisis; Renewable energy; Great Barrier Reef; Environment; Australia news; Queensland; Carmichael coalmine; Coal; Energy; Fossil fuels; Fossil fuel divestment; Business; Superannuation; Newcastle and the Hunter; Oceans,Environment
2018-03-17T07:00:16Z,"Investment ISAs: Act now or lose your £20,000 allowance",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/mar/17/investment-isas-act-now-or-lose-your-20000-allowance,"Investors have under three weeks left to exploit this tax year’s £20,000 tax-free Isa allowance. Most opt for safe cash Isas, but investment Isas, with the money going into stocks and shares, offer greater potential, though much greater risk. Last year the average UK-invested fund has returned 4.4% – but over five years they average 44%. Money invested in European funds has grown 8% over the year and 60% over five years. Global emerging markets funds are up 14% over the past year and 37% over five years. But those are the averages. If you had picked one of the most popular UK funds – Neil Woodford’s Equity Income fund – you are likely to be smarting at the 11.5% fall, and the gain of just 3.2% over three years – worse than cash Isas. Terry Smith’s popular Fundsmith Equity has had another great year, gaining 11% and giving investors an extraordinary 137% gain over five years. So how do you go about choosing an investment Isa? Here’s your brief guide: What are the tax benefits? When you invest in Isas, your money is free from UK tax. So if your investments grow, you won’t have to pay capital gains tax – although even if you held a fund outside an Isa, you would still be able to make a gain of £11,300 without having to pay capital gains tax. There is also no tax on dividends paid by companies – although, again, everyone currently qualifies for £5,000 worth of dividends without tax. However, for the 2018-19 tax year, the dividend allowance will fall to £2,000, making Isas more attractive again if held for the long term. You don’t need to declare Isas on your tax return, simplifying your finances. What should you invest in? You can buy individual shares and put them in an Isa – such as Lloyds Bank shares, currently paying dividends worth around 4.5%. But most investors should opt for a fund, which is a basket of shares such as Lloyds and, typically, 50-60 other shares, to avoid the risk of any individual company going bust. These funds go under names such as “unit trusts” (the most common) and “investment trusts” (generally cheaper). Trouble is, there are thousands to pick from. But you don’t have to pick just one – you can mix, say, a UK fund with a European fund and a North American fund, for example. You can do this yourself – trustnet.com is a good place to gauge performance – or financial advisers, while costly, will pick them for you. Currently the best-selling funds in the UK include Fundsmith Equity, JP Morgan Emerging Markets, Jupiter Income, First State Asia Focus, Lindsell Train Global Equity and Legg Mason Japan Equity. The most popular shares are BP, Lloyds, Legal &amp; General, Shell, Vodafone and Glaxo. Popular investment trusts include F&amp;C, Alliance, Scottish Mortgage and Monks. An increasingly popular approach is to buy a “multi-asset fund” which mix shares, bonds and cash deposits, with Vanguard’s Life Strategy funds the big seller. One choice concerns “active” or “passive” funds. Active funds employ a human (expensive) to trade shares. Passive funds are computer-run (cheap), and replicate an index, such as the FTSE 100. Who do I use to invest? If you are reasonably intelligent, investing is simpler than you think, saving a fortune in fees. You can buy direct from providers such as Vanguard, Fidelity and Fundsmith, with the fee based on the fund. Fundsmith Equity costs 1% a year, Vanguard’s are 0.15%. But for most other funds, you generally have to go through a website, usually called a platform. There, you pick the shares or funds you want, and when you come to checkout, you pay a fee for the underlying fund, and a fee to the platform that adminsters them for you. Hargreaves Lansdown, Fidelity and Standard Life are big players. Cavendish Online is usually rated the cheapest, charging 0.25% on top of the fund charge, around 0.7-1% for active funds, but half that for passive funds. If investing under £10,000, other cheap providers include Rplan, AJ Bell, and Charles Stanley Direct, while iWeb from Halifax is cheap if investing larger sums. What if I want advice? You have two options: the “robo” advisers or the traditional financial advisers. “Robos” tend to create and manage simple portfolios at low cost, run online. Often they use cheap “exchange-traded funds” and “trackers” to cut costs. Names include Nutmeg, MoneyFarm, Wealthify and Evestor, which will set you up even for small sums, while Scaleable Capital and Investec Click and Invest start at over £10,000, and UBS SmartWealth from £15,000. If you want full advice – only worth it if you have large sums– then locate an adviser at unbiased.co.uk. The standard advice? Ask friends and family for a trusted adviser. Innovative ISAs: Risky? Perhaps Adventurous investors are being offered the chance to earn returns of up to 15% with a new type of Isa. But this is very risky stuff – you could lose some – or all – of your money. The “innovative finance” Isa is a new account for peer-to-peer lending, where borrowers are matched with investors. The latter can earn tax-free interest on their loans when held within the Isa “wrapper”. Dozens of firms offer such Isas, which are also allowed to include debt-based crowdfunding. However, be aware that your capital is at risk, and these investments are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. One of those offering the highest returns is business lending platform Ablrate, which says its lender investors “are enjoying returns of 10-15%”. Meanwhile, the website of crowdfunding platform Crowd for Angels quotes rates of up to 12%.

There’s a DIY ethical route | Aditya Chakrabortty,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/23/pensions-ethically-investment-city-money-social-environmental,"Right on the doorstep of the world’s greatest financial centre sits one of Britain’s oldest council estates. Built in the 1890s, the Boundary is a beauty: Grade II-listed red-brick blocks radiating out from a circular garden complete with bandstand. Yet for the City of London, the estate’s tenants are as visible as the crofters of the Outer Hebrides. The Square Mile’s financiers raise billions for big companies, but not a penny in loose change reaches the Boundary. Still, the estate’s residents are as enterprising as any of Lord Sugar’s apprentices. Visiting a fortnight ago for a fundraiser, I chatted to a resident with a first-class degree who’d built a successful social enterprise making sandals from reclaimed leather – and now trains other local women to do the same. The couple of grand needed to get going came not from the banks, but from Kickstarter. Here, bankers were those aloof types who rented ex-council flats for more than £2,000 a month, but who barely spoke to their social-tenant neighbours. “Quantitative easing never came here,” says longstanding resident Philip Green, and I imagined what it must be like waking each morning to the slosh of millions outside your window and knowing they would only ever come your way to drive you out. A week after that visit, Polly Toynbee wrote on these pages of how she’d been barred from the annual general meeting for Melrose, the vultures who have just bought the engineering giant GKN. In their hands, one of Britain’s last remaining big engineers will probably be stripped for parts while skilled workers in the Midlands lose their jobs. But some people are going to do just fine: even as my colleague fumed outside, shareholders voted through a £167m bonus for the four men at the top. The basic role of financial markets is to turn savings into productive investments. You, a retiree in Berkshire, have 10 grand sitting idle; while I, a frustrated wage slave in Bangor, have an ingenious idea for my own business. Financiers bring us together and – hey presto! – you get a return, I start my company and the country grows a little bit richer. This is the Ladybird version of events, but in both the above stories you can see how far short reality falls. Here is a City in which those at the top fill their pockets, yet seem unwilling or unable to put that money to better use. “To see what is in front of one’s nose needs a constant struggle,” wrote George Orwell. For Britons, even 10 years after the crash, the finance sector is that thing so close as to evade perspective. It gets bashed for bonuses, for tax dodging, for reckless innovation. What you hardly ever hear about is the vital part: how badly it does its supposed job of investing productively in society. That, after all, is why the banks got all those bailout billions. Yet over the 10 years from Tony Blair entering No 10 to Northern Rock’s collapse, over one in every three pounds – 36% – lent by banks and building societies went to other financial institutions, according to official figures analysed by Prof Sukhdev Johal of Queen Mary University of London. Just under 9% was lent on property – almost as much as the 9.7% that went to manufacturing and productive businesses. Since the crash, minister after minister has exhorted the banks to lend more to the real economy. Deals have been signed, Bank of England schemes set up. Yet since 2008, 33% of bank loans have still gone to other financial institutions, with over 9% put on real estate. As for the share going to manufacturing and productive businesses, that’s dropped to 6.3%. So much for reform. Britons entrust fund managers with more than £2.3tn of assets for our pensions, according to the Office for National Statistics, and another £585bn in Isas and personal equity plans, or Peps. How much of that money – our money – goes into building the hospitals, railways and broadband infrastructure that we need? Not enough. That is not just my view, but also that of George Osborne. As chancellor, he spent years pleading with pension funds to invest more in building infrastructure, under the banner of “British savings for British jobs”. Unveiling his autumn statement in 2011, he said: “We need to put to work the many billions of pounds that British people save, in British pension funds, and get those savings invested in British projects.” Osborne boasted of an agreement with fund managers to “unlock” £20bn of cash. Four years later, one key result is the Pensions Infrastructure Platform, which has invested a grand total of £1bn. But what became of the other £19bn? Presumably it went the way of the “northern powerhouse”. In 2012, around the time Osborne began haggling with asset managers, the eminent City economist Roger Bootle gave a lecture asking “what the great Victorian entrepreneurs would have done if they had been confronted by interest rates and bond yields as low as we have today”. His answer: “They would have rebuilt the world.” Well, 21st-century Britain boasts a financial system 10 times the size of its economy. It also has a longstanding housing crisis, and is rapidly being left behind by other rich countries on everything from broadband to green energy. On the one hand, there are the social uses to which our money could be put and make a return; on the other, there is the hole into which it actually gets poured. Alternatives to this broken financial system are scarce and small, but an interesting one is about to launch. It offers savers a chance to invest in building 30 affordable family homes and supported living flats in Kirkby, just north of Liverpool, that will be let to those stuck on the local council’s waiting list. The families who live in them will be on long-term tenancies. Your money goes into a three-year debenture, or IOU, which you can put into an Isa and that will pay 4.5% annual interest (versus a base rate of 0.5%). In this way, the £3.9m needed for building the site will be crowdsourced over the internet. A small development for a relatively small sum on Merseyside, where nearly 37,000 households are on the waiting list for a home: all pretty straightforward, you might think. Not so. Developers normally build houses to sell – banking the money to finance the next project – while Octevo Housing Solutions plans to hold on to the houses for 50 years, before selling them to a housing association for a quid each. It was a bold idea and an exciting one, which chairman Robert Macmaster thought would win over the big banks and pension funds. “They loved the idea, loved the scheme,” he says. “But they kept asking: show us one you’ve built before.” The money managers judged it too risky. “They wanted the gravy; they just didn’t want to chop the vegetables or cook the meat.” Seen from the pinstriped side of the table, Macmaster runs a small provincial builder with a novel business model that offers in the first instance only a few million in returns. Asking a big, bureaucratic fund to go through all the legal and technical hassle of getting on board with that – well, elephants can more easily be taught to play polo. In the end he took the idea to an ethical investment platform. For the past six years, Abundance has been pooling small investors’ savings into tidal energy and geothermal power plants. Small, worthwhile projects that serve a public need but which don’t get funded through conventional finance. “Finance wants us to think of money as something divorced from reality. It makes a return but you don’t need to understand how that return came about,” says Abundance partner Bruce Davis. “We want to make money real, tangible, political. To make people realise their money has power and that you have a power to exercise that.” Last Wednesday, I toured an Octevo development in Liverpool city centre, a mix of affordable and supported living very similar to the one that will be funded by Abundance. On most new estates, you can tell the affordable bit: it’s smaller, meaner and sometimes comes with its own “poor door”, which keeps the social tenants away from the private occupiers. Octevo’s James Ritchie told me how “most developers hate building affordable. Hate it.” Here, everything was affordable and the flats came with high ceilings and good-quality kitchens and bathrooms. Some even had roof beams that Ritchie had had to fight the council planners to preserve. The subcontractors, he said, were paid within two weeks – compare that to Carillion’s contracts on the never-never. This is all different from the normal, but you can criticise it for not being alternative enough. The flats are set at 80% of market rent, meaning their tenants will most likely be reliant on housing benefit. While Octevo and Abundance talk of future projects using more green energy, the building work that starts this summer will be much more conventional. The flats will be let by a for-profit housing association, rather than the more traditional charitable equivalent. And of the £3.9m to be raised, Abundance is taking £200,000. If this is industry standard, then Abundance should think about whether it wants to play by the standards of the industry to which it is an alternative. “It’ll do no harm, but it doesn’t set the pulse racing,” says Ronnie Hughes, who spent decades at one of the big Liverpool housing associations. “They could have been a lot more radical from the off: made the rent cheaper and gone greener.” And perhaps thought more about the development as a community in the making. I hope that projects to come will have the subtle radicalism that Hughes is looking for. But for now, there’ll be 30 homes for families who would otherwise be in temporary accommodation. This kind of social or impact investment remains a tiny part of all the investment that happens in the UK. As a market worth less than £2bn, it’s beset by small-pool syndrome: the same names crop up on the same roundtables and taskforces and some of the investment celebrated as “social” should not be in the market at all. When companies are trying to monetise their ability to reduce homelessness, you need a strong stomach not to feel queasy. But the conundrum remains. Britain has huge savings and a huge finance sector: it also has huge deficiencies in its infrastructure – everything from social housing to roads. Not all of that can be fixed out of the public purse, so what role should be played by private finance? In big French companies, pension savers are offered the chance to invest 10% of their money in a fond solidaire, or solidarity fund, which supports unlisted social enterprises. In Britain, your average pension member doesn’t even get consulted on what values they’d like their money to support – whether fighting climate change or building social housing. Yet, rather than tackle those issues, the Labour party seeks to build a parallel finance system, in the form of a National Investment Bank, while other left economists talk about building a sovereign wealth fund, just as Norway has done with the proceeds of North Sea oil. But we have a sovereign wealth fund already. It’s worth over £2tn and it’s called our pension funds. The big battle is to give us agency over our own savings, rather than leaving it all to some pinstriped manager on a fat commission. Abundance’s Davis told me about his own portfolio, which includes a part share in a wind turbine. “I see it when driving up the M4, just above Bristol. It’s always windy, meaning it’s making me a good return. It beats listening to whether the FTSE has gone up or down today by 1.23 points.” • Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist This article was amended on 23 May 2018 to correct the spelling of Kirkby, a town north of Liverpool",Pensions; Financial sector; Business; Money; Investing; Investment funds; Investments; Investment Isas; Isas; Family finances; Social housing; Society,Opinion
